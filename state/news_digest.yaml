    date: "2026-02-14"
    headline: "Fed holds at 3.50-3.75%. Inflation sticky. Two cuts expected in 2026, first likely June"
    details: |
      Fed maintained 3.50-3.75% at Jan 28 meeting. Pausing easing cycle after 3 cuts in 2025.
      CPI sticky — prices remain elevated. Fresh inflation readings not supportive of near-term cuts.
      CME FedWatch: first cut probability highest for June 2026.
      New Fed Chair transition possibility adds uncertainty.

    headlines:

    impact: |
      INSIDER SELLING ESCALATING FURTHER. Three separate executives in 6 days totaling $6.1M.
      Feb 6: EVP Majors ($4.4M) + Director Blinn ($259K)
      Feb 12: EVP Haworth ($1.43M)
      This is now an UNMISTAKABLE PATTERN post-Q4 earnings.
      Haworth exercised options at $50.64 and sold at $142-144 = taking profits on vested comp.
      Majors' sale of 30,790 shares ($4.4M) is the largest and most concerning.
      COUNTERPOINT: Guidance was RAISED. Company is executing well operationally.
      COUNTERPOINT: Sales may be pre-arranged 10b5-1 plans (not confirmed for all).
      Still, $6.1M in insider selling in 6 days from 3 different executives is a SIGNAL.
      No kill condition triggered but this is the strongest bearish datapoint since SEC/DOJ clearing.
    action: MONITOR_CLOSELY
    context: "HOLD MEDIUM but insider selling pattern now at $6.1M/6 days from 3 execs. Guidance raised is bullish counter. Watch for more sales."

    impact: |
      ADBE grinding near lows. Touched $251 intraday Feb 12 (possible local bottom).
      Institutional accumulation (Cantillon adding 157K shares) = smart money buying.
      Contrarian narrative starting to form: Adobe shipping AI (Firefly 70M+ MAU) not being replaced.
      At ~$263 vs FV $390 = MoS ~33%. Thesis FULLY INTACT on fundamentals.
      The narrative is sector-wide fear, not ADBE-specific fundamental deterioration.
      FTC trial Oct 2026 remains the TRUE binary risk.

    impact: |
      No new developments in last 48h specifically.
      CagriSema NDA filed Dec 2025 (ahead of schedule). FDA review underway for 2026 decision.
      End of March H2H data vs Zepbound = BINARY catalyst.
      If CagriSema wins: stock re-rates, ADD order may trigger.
      If CagriSema loses: FV revision needed, thesis weakened.

      Berenberg + RBC defending stock — bull case relies on FCA moat + own AI development.
      CEO taking outside non-exec role during crisis = MINOR negative (distraction signal).
      Feb 23 earnings = FATE of position. KC#9 (AI strategy): does management have a plan?
      Without credible AI strategy: EXIT at 130p per plan.
      With credible strategy: maintain position, possibly upgrade from PROBATION.

      KC#3 (product quality / brand perception) is now APPROACHING TRIGGER.
      Two QC incidents in <3 weeks = systemic quality control problem under interim leadership.
      Heart Scatter selling out despite complaints suggests demand still exists for LULU brand.
      Jane Nielsen candidacy (ex-Ralph Lauren) viewed positively by analysts (Needham).
      NO permanent CEO appointment yet. Dual proxy fight (Elliott vs Wilson) adds uncertainty.
      At $171 vs FV $196 = MoS ~13%. THIN for 8 active kill conditions.
