    impact: |
      Goldman Sachs SELL is the most significant NEW development since Saturday scan.
      Three major downgrades (Goldman SELL, Oppenheimer Perform, Piper Sandler Neutral) in ~5 weeks.
      Goldman PT $290 = 10% above current, implying limited downside from here.
      AI seat compression thesis is the bear case: fewer humans = fewer Adobe seats.
      COUNTER: ARR + RPO both grew double digits. Large enterprise deals committed.
      Smart money (Cantillon) accumulating despite analyst pessimism.
      At $263 vs FV $390 = MoS ~33%. If Goldman is right at $290, still 10% upside.
      P/E 15x = lowest in ADBE history. Market pricing in structural decline.
    action: MONITOR

      Total insider selling now $7.4M/51,129 shares across 3 months (expanded view).
      Haworth sale confirmed as options exercise (less concerning than discretionary).
      Majors' 38.9% position reduction remains the most bearish datapoint.
      NEW: Caprock Group institutional BUY $1.06M = positive counter-signal.
      Kill conditions: KC#1 (new fraud evidence) = NO. KC#4 (new investigation) = NO.
      Class action from 2024 still pending but no escalation.

      CBS News headline: "Is Lululemon coming apart at the seams?" — mainstream media narrative turning.
      Wilson vs Elliott = dueling activist campaigns = maximum governance chaos.
      POSITIVE: Heart Scatter sizes SOLD OUT despite complaints (demand exists).

      POSITIVE NEW DATA: CagriSema outperforming Ozempic in diabetes trial (A1C + weight).
      This STRENGTHENS the CagriSema pipeline thesis ahead of March H2H vs Zepbound.
      Wegovy oral pill uptake exceeding expectations (170K patients in 4 weeks).
      MASH label expansion = new revenue stream (liver disease market $15B+).
      Berenberg PT cut is adjustment to guidance reality, not thesis abandonment.
      At $49.57 vs FV $66 = MoS ~25%. Stabilizing after guidance shock.
      End March CagriSema H2H vs Zepbound = BINARY. If superior: stock re-rates. If inferior: KC triggered.

      6 DAYS TO EARNINGS. This is the CRITICAL event for this position.
      Insurify ChatGPT crash already absorbed. Analyst defense suggests overreaction.
      KEY: Management MUST articulate credible AI strategy on Feb 23 call.
      Three outcomes:
        1. BULL: Revenue beat + credible AI plan = upgrade from probation
        2. BASE: In-line + vague AI comments = extend probation
        3. BEAR: Revenue miss or no AI strategy = EXIT at 130p

      Management buying back stock AGGRESSIVELY at declining prices = strong confidence signal.
