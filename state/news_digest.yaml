      No new developments since Q4 beat on Feb 5. Beat confirms PEAK CYCLE profitability,

    impact: |
      CORRECTION: Q4 was actually a slight MISS ($3.39 vs $3.44 consensus), not a beat.
      However, FY2026 guidance RAISED to $14.95-15.65 which is genuinely bullish.
      INSIDER SELLING ESCALATING: EVP Majors ($4.4M) + Director Blinn ($259K) both on Feb 6.
      Combined with prior Session 67 data of 39% insider selling, this is now a PATTERN.
      The volume of insider selling ($4.7M in a single day) post-earnings is concerning.
      Bulls: guidance raised, $4B buyback, SEC cleared. Bears: insiders selling heavily post-earnings.
      Stock ~$142 vs FV $191 = MoS 26%. Position itself is performing well.
    action: MONITOR_CLOSELY
    context: "HOLD MEDIUM but WATCH insider selling pattern. Guidance raised is bullish. Insiders selling is bearish signal. No KC triggered but worth monitoring."

  ADBE:

      ADBE continues grinding lower in the AI fear trade. Stock at $262.50 vs our cost $270.60.
      Unrealized loss ~3%. FV $390, MoS ~33%. Thesis FULLY INTACT on fundamentals.
      The narrative is about AI REPLACING Adobe. The reality is Adobe is SHIPPING AI (Firefly 70M MAU).
      P/E 15x is the cheapest Adobe has EVER been — including the 2008 crisis.
      Oct 2026 FTC trial remains the TRUE binary risk, not AI narrative.
      At these levels, ADD is tempting but principles say no ADD until FTC clarity.

    impact: |
      KEY UPDATE: CagriSema NDA was already FILED Dec 18, not just expected Q1.
      This is ahead of our previous understanding. FDA review now underway for 2026 decision.
      Head-to-head vs Zepbound data expected END OF MARCH = major binary catalyst.
      If CagriSema beats Zepbound: NVO regains competitive narrative, stock re-rates.
      If CagriSema loses: thesis seriously weakened, NVO becomes a Tier B pure price play.
      At $49 vs FV $66, MoS ~25%. Stock stabilizing. March data is THE catalyst.

    impact: |
      No new news since the Insurify ChatGPT crash. Stock languishing near 153p.
      Berenberg FCA moat argument is the strongest bull case — UK insurance comparison
      requires FCA authorization which ChatGPT cannot obtain directly.
      CEO taking outside non-exec role during this crisis period is a MINOR negative signal
      (suggests he has bandwidth for outside activities rather than laser-focused on AI response).
      Feb 23 earnings is 10 days away. THE question: credible AI strategy or not?
      Without credible AI strategy from management: EXIT at 130p per plan.
      With credible strategy: maintain position, possibly upgrade from PROBATION.
    action: PREPARE_EARNINGS_FRAMEWORK

    impact: |
      SECOND see-through incident in <3 weeks is now a PATTERN, not an isolated event.
      KC#3 (product quality / brand perception) is APPROACHING TRIGGER.
      Bloomberg escalation of coverage + founder Wilson public criticism = brand damage amplifying.
      Two quality incidents + no permanent CEO + activist fight = governance chaos.
      The Jane Nielsen candidacy (ex-Ralph Lauren) is the ONLY positive development.
      Needham calls her "one of the most well-respected executives in the industry."
      However, NO permanent CEO appointment yet. Interim co-CEOs since Jan 31.
      At $171 vs FV $196, MoS ~13% which is THIN for a company with 8 active kill conditions.
      Mar 31 earnings: if negative comps + GM <57% + no CEO = EXIT.

    impact: |
      Management buying back shares aggressively at 463p confirms board confidence.
      UK used car market demand metrics are genuinely strong — 86.3M visits is robust.
      The dealer revolt data from Nov-Dec 2025 is known and priced in (59 cancellations, 180 downgrades).
      No NEW dealer revolt developments in Feb. Quiet period before April pricing.
      April 2026 pricing event remains the DEFINITIVE catalyst.

      - "No new company-specific news"
      - "Earnings May 26, 2026"
    impact: |
      No new fundamental data. Stock weakness is sector-driven (SaaS/AI fears), not BYIT-specific.
      HSBC upgrade to 625p (Feb 2026) is a strong positive signal.
      At ~330p vs FV 345p = MoS near zero. Position is small, unrealized loss manageable.

      Positive ESP (+0.94%) + strong beat history (+6.9% avg) suggests another beat likely.
      However, at current ~$251, stock is AT consensus PT. Entry needs $210-220 for adequate MoS.
      Post-earnings: if beats + guides up, stock likely rises further FROM entry.

      ChipStack AI Super Agent is a POSITIVE catalyst — CDNS is AI BENEFICIARY, not victim.
      The export control guilty plea is ALREADY RESOLVED ($140M paid, 3yr probation).
      It is a known risk but NOT a forward threat.
      imec CEO on board strengthens semiconductor ecosystem partnerships.
      At ~$295 vs revised entry $230-240, stock is 22-28% above entry zone.
      Post-earnings volatility could move it closer to or further from entry.
