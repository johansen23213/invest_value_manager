      BofA downgrade confirms structural headwind thesis. UHS is explicitly named as
      most exposed to OBBBA Medicaid cuts (behavioral health reliance).
      Cuts begin rolling 2026 but most pain 2027+. Still, guidance will reflect this.

      Firefly adoption strong (70M MAU). Cash flow generation excellent ($10B OCF).

      BEAT on both EPS and revenue but stock FELL -1.7%. Market not rewarding.
      Broader tech/data selloff weighing on shares (-24.7% last month).
      At $155, MORN is trading at massive discount to consensus PTs.

    impact: |
      ROP is in freefall territory (-19% 3mo). 52wL $331 hit.
      Director insider buy at $358 = confidence signal at these levels.
      However, Mizuho Underperform + Barclays Underweight are notable bears.
      At $335-351, trigger $300 is 11-14% away. LESS CLOSE than Session 63's 6.6%.
      Price may have bounced from lows, widening gap from trigger.

      Post-earnings stock ~$105 is within the upper range of R3 entry zone.
      Massive institutional buy ($95M) = smart money entering.
      Per-seat pricing risk (KC#8) not triggered — no evidence of seat erosion yet.

      MASSIVE CRASH validates our caution. Standing order condition was 'WAIT Q1'.
      At EUR 18, stock is 14% above trigger EUR 15.50. But the CANCEL conditions are flashing:
      Q1 growth <3% condition is now in play since FY guidance is 3-5%.
      ARR growth only 6% = 'underwhelming' per Jefferies (SaaSPocalypse trade).
      This is EXACTLY the pattern we flagged: execution risk + anemic growth.
      NVIDIA partnership is a positive but won't move needle near-term.
    action: REVIEW_STANDING_ORDER
    context: |
      Standing order EUR 15.50 with condition: 'Cancel if Q1 growth <3%.'
      FY guidance 3-5% = Q1 might be <3%. Monitor Q1 results before executing.
      If stock falls further toward EUR 15.50, need to re-evaluate whether CANCEL
      is appropriate given the severity of the selloff and analyst reactions.

      PBT decline is cost-driven, not structural. FCF impressive.
