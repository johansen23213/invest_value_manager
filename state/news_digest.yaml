summary: |
  SCAN 2026-02-09: 0 CRITICAS, 7 MATERIALES, 9 MENORES

  CRITICAL ALERTS: NONE

  MATERIAL (thesis-relevant but not thesis-breaking):
  1. ADBE: -10% in week on AI fears. THESIS-AWARE, creates more MoS. HOLD.
  2. NVO: -17% crash Feb 4 (we bought post), +8% recovery Feb 7 (Hims pullback). NET POSITIVE.
  3. ALL: Q4 record BUT Arity -50%, CEO sold $3.3M. Core strong. HOLD probation.
  4. LULU: CEO departed Jan 31 (known at purchase). Co-CEOs interim. HOLD.
  5. SAN.PA: Q4 beat, Dupixent +32%, EUR 1B buyback. POSITIVE.
  6. EDEN.PA: Earnings Feb 24. Rebasing year. Monitor 2027-28 guidance.
  7. DNLM.L: Interims Feb 10. PBT at lower end. Validates lower entry price.

  EARNINGS WATCH (next 17 days):
  - Feb 10: DNLM.L interims (watchlist)
  - Feb 19: BBWI Q4 (standing order watchlist)
  - Feb 23: MONY.L (portfolio, LOW conviction)
  - Feb 24: EDEN.PA (portfolio, MEDIUM conviction)
  - Feb 25: VICI (portfolio, LOW conviction) + UHS (portfolio, LOW conviction)
  - Feb 26: DTE.DE (portfolio, MEDIUM conviction)

  STANDING ORDERS: None near trigger. Closest is DNLM.L but still 15-20% away.

  OVERALL ASSESSMENT: No action required. Portfolio stable. 5 earnings in next
  2.5 weeks require preparation. DTE.DE approaching adversarial FV (EUR 33-35)
  on rally - potential TRIM candidate if hits target.
