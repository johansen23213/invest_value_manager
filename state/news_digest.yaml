        HAPPENING TODAY: T-Mobile US reports Q4/FY2025 and provides updated
        2026-2027 financial targets. DTE.DE owns 51% of TMUS.
        Wall Street expects TMUS Q4 EPS $2.11 (-17.9% YoY).
        TMUS has beaten estimates in all prior 4 quarters (avg surprise +9%).
        DTE.DE stock ~EUR 30.26 — approaching adversarial FV EUR 33-35.
        DTE.DE own results Feb 26.
        KEY: If TMUS raises 2026-2027 targets, DTE.DE continues rally toward
        adversarial FV (TRIM consideration). If disappoints, pullback opportunity.

    - ticker: MONY.L
      headline: "Post AI-disruption selloff: stock partially recovered to ~167p (from 147p low on Feb 10). Still -26% from pre-crash levels. Earnings Feb 23."
      classification: MATERIAL
      source: "Investing.com, Yahoo Finance, Sharecast"
      impact: |
        FOLLOW-UP from Feb 10 scan: MONY.L hit 147.46p on Insurify ChatGPT
        insurance app news. Has bounced to ~167p but remains well below
        pre-crash levels (~224p 52-week high). 52-week low is now 166p.
        AI disruption threat to comparison websites is STRUCTURAL and NEW.
        Earnings Feb 23 — this will dominate the call.
        Adversarial FV was 201 GBp but may need downward revision if AI
        threat is confirmed as structural.
        THESIS REASSESSMENT REQUIRED BEFORE FEB 23.

    - ticker: AUTO.L
      headline: "NEW 52-WEEK LOW at 469.98p (Feb 10). Jefferies downgrade to Hold. Deal Builder dealer revolt. JPM underweight."
      classification: MATERIAL
      source: "MarketBeat, The Markets Daily, Car Dealer Magazine"
      impact: |
        NEW DEVELOPMENT since last scan: AUTO.L hit fresh 52-week low.
        Multiple analyst downgrades:
        - Jefferies: Buy to Hold, PT cut 895p to 650p (Deal Builder concerns)
        - Berenberg: PT cut 830p to 665p
        - JPMorgan: reaffirmed Underweight
        Dealer revolt: 180+ dealers downgraded subscriptions after mandatory
        Deal Builder rollout. Dealers threatening "mass cancellations."
        April 2026 pricing event is key: Deal Builder was supposed to be the
        "tent pole" supporting price increases. Uncertainty now acute.
        CEO Coe denied Deal Builder is responsible, blamed AI uncertainty.
        Our adversarial review flagged "Moat under active siege" as a risk.
        Stock now ~472p vs our entry. Buyback ongoing (800K shares at 479p).
        THIS IS THE MOAT SIEGE RISK MATERIALIZING IN REAL TIME.

      MOAT SIEGE RISK MATERIALIZING. The adversarial review flagged dealer revolt
      as a key risk. 180+ dealers downgraded. April pricing event is make-or-break.
      Stock hitting new lows despite strong engagement data (visits +24.7%).
      Multiple analyst downgrades create negative momentum.
      However: engagement remains very strong, buyback ongoing, and supply
      constraint (5-7yr old cars -25-30% in 2026) actually favors AUTO.L pricing.
      THIS NEEDS THESIS REVIEW — is the moat siege temporary or structural?
