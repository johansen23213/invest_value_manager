        PIPELINE CRITICAL: Results were released after close Feb 11 but search engines
        have not yet indexed the actual numbers. Conference call was at 5pm ET Feb 11.
        Pre-report context:
        - Stock at ~$119 (down from ~$129 prior week = -7.6%)
        - Consensus: EPS $2.44 (+5.2% YoY), Revenue $542.7M (+9.9% YoY)

        - Paycom has beat Zacks consensus 3 of last 4 quarters (avg surprise 9.8%)
        - Investing.com notes guidance will be key -- can it stabilize battered stock?
        Our entry target: $95-105. Current ~$119 = still 13-25% above target.

        - Does NOT hold analyst conference calls -- submits written Q&A
        - PitchBook private market indexes = new revenue stream catalyst
        If earnings disappoint, stock could reach $145 quickly.
        If earnings beat, still a quality compounder at extreme discount.

        - Strategic update calls expected in Feb-Mar from interim team
        - Product reset: 35% new styles for spring, dev cycle shortened to 12-14 months

        - UBS: UHS less exposed than Acadia to NY Medicaid interstate limits
        - NY creates $25-30M EBITDA headwind for ACADIA, UHS facility mix protects

        - Product availability issues resolved
        - Dividend: ex-div Mar 12, pay Apr 7
        - Stock at ~931p, our trigger 750-800p = 16-19% away

        - Barclays reaffirms Buy rating
        - FY2025 results Feb 25
        ASSESSMENT: CEO transition is a RISK for continuity of strategy.
        McKinstry was exceptional operator. Caywood needs to prove herself.
        FY2025 results + CEO transition commentary will be important.
        Our entry target EUR 50-55 vs current ~EUR 76 = still far above entry.
      action: "MONITOR Feb 25 results. CEO transition adds uncertainty. Entry far away."

  Tickers scanned: 19 (13 portfolio + 6 watchlist)

  CRITICAL ALERTS: NONE

  KEY CHANGES SINCE LAST SCAN:
  1. [CORRECTION] WPP.L: Strategic update is Feb 26, NOT Feb 19. Restructuring leaked.
  2. [RESOLVED] MONY.L: Earnings CONFIRMED Feb 23 pre-market (not Feb 16).
  3. [PENDING] PAYC: Q4 results released after close Feb 11 -- not yet indexed.
  4. [TONIGHT] MORN: Q4 results after close TODAY Feb 12. Stock at $154, near entry $145.
  5. [NEW] DSY.PA: Full FY2025 results out. Growth 3-5% guidance validates SO. Below market.

  7. [NEW] WKL.AS: CEO McKinstry retiring. Caywood successor. FY2025 results Feb 25.

  PROBATION POSITIONS (3):
  - MONY.L: Earnings Feb 23. Stock near FV. 4 kill conditions ready.
  - VICI: Earnings Feb 25. AFFO guidance critical.
  - UHS: Earnings Feb 25. Medicaid risk. MANDATORY SELL/HOLD.

  STANDING ORDERS:
  - FGP.L closest (~3-6%) but NO adversarial pipeline
  - WPP.L ~7% but review DEFERRED to Feb 26 (not Feb 19)
  - DSY.PA ~11%, guidance miss may push price lower

  ACTIONS REQUIRED (priority):
  1. [IMMEDIATE] Verify PAYC Q4 actual results (check price reaction)
  2. [TONIGHT] MORN Q4 results -- if stock drops to $145, accelerate buy-pipeline
  3. [FEB 23] MONY.L earnings -- ON PROBATION, framework ready
  4. [FEB 24] EDEN.PA earnings -- EXIT if guidance <5%
  5. [FEB 25] UHS + VICI -- PROBATION decisions MANDATORY

  ## Coverage
  - Tickers scanned: 19/19 (13 active + 6 watchlist)
  - All 13 active positions covered
  - All 6 key watchlist items covered (PAYC, MORN, DSY.PA, DNLM.L, WKL.AS, WPP.L)

  ## Key Findings This Scan
  1. WPP.L date correction (Feb 26 not Feb 19) is operationally significant --
     changes our standing order review timeline by 7 days.
  2. MONY.L earnings confirmed Feb 23 -- resolves previous ambiguity.
  3. PAYC results still not indexed -- limitation of news aggregator lag.
     Should check via price_checker.py for market reaction as proxy.
  4. DSY.PA full results provide concrete data for standing order validation.

  ## Limitations
  - PAYC actual Q4 results not available in any search engine yet (released <12h ago)
  - MORN results not available yet (reports tonight)
  - Price data from search results may be delayed; use price_checker.py for live quotes

  ## Anomalies
  - None detected

  ## Suggestions
  - Run price_checker.py on PAYC to see post-earnings market reaction as proxy for results
  - If PAYC dropped to ~$105 or below, the results may have disappointed -- accelerate pipeline
  - If PAYC stayed flat/up, results likely in-line or beat -- wait for our $95-105 entry
  - MORN results tonight could create immediate opportunity if stock drops to $145
