meta_reflection:
  movements_without_explanation: []

  new_information_since_last_pulse:
    - "ADBE: Goldman Sachs downgrade Buy->Sell, Oppenheimer downgrade. Multiple analyst downgrades NOT in previous pulse."
    - "SAN.PA: UBS downgrade Buy->Neutral, PT cut 105->88. Amlitelimab Phase III FAILURE. CFO admission on Dupixent replacement gap. THIS IS MATERIAL AND NEW."
    - "AUTO.L: Dealer listings <400k (10-year low). Dealer exodus narrative. NOT in original thesis."
    - "HRB: Continued slide to 52w low post Q2 miss. Guidance miss marginal but market unforgiving."
    - "VICI: Scotiabank downgrade to Sector Perform."

  correlations:
    - "7 of 16 positions near 52w lows - portfolio skewed to 'falling knives'. This is by design (value approach) but concentration of downside risk is notable."
    - "ALL + GL both near 52w highs - insurance sector strength (both on probation/low conviction)"
    - "ADBE + LULU + NVO + AUTO.L + BYIT.L all >40% below 52w highs - 'fallen angel' cluster. This is intentional strategy."
    - "UK positions (MONY.L, AUTO.L, BYIT.L, DOM.L, IMB.L, HRB-US-but-UK-like) showing broad weakness"

  anomalies:
    - "DOM.L -22.6% is largest loss in portfolio. No adversarial review done yet (Fase 4 Tier B pending). Should be prioritized."
    - "SAN.PA -14.9% with pipeline failure + analyst downgrades. Needs urgent adversarial review before further decline."

  suggestions:
    - "URGENT: SAN.PA adversarial review - pipeline failure is potential kill condition for pharma thesis"
    - "PRIORITIZE: DOM.L adversarial review - -22.6% is portfolio's worst performer"
    - "MONITOR: HRB at 52w low - Q3 tax season will be make-or-break"
    - "WATCH: AUTO.L dealer exodus narrative - validate with H1 results"
    - "CONSIDER: ALL + GL near 52w highs on probation/low conviction - these are the best performing positions but lowest conviction. Paradox worth examining."
