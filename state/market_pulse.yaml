    AI DISRUPTION WAVE: Anthropic tools (Claude Cowork/Code) triggered ~$285B wipeout in
    software + financial services stocks since Feb 3. 164 stocks hit. Hedge fund net exposure
    to software at record low <3%. This impacts ADBE (directly), MONY.L (indirectly via ChatGPT
    insurance apps), WKL.AS (legal AI plugin). Broader market resilient; Dow at records.
  sector_moves:
    ai_disruption: |
      MONY.L -12.7% today (Tuio Home + Insurify launch ChatGPT insurance apps).
      WKL.AS -43% YoY (Anthropic legal plugin). ADBE at 52w low.
      Admiral, GoCompare also hit. RBC says impact "overstated".
    tech_software: |
      ADBE at 52w low. Broader SaaS selloff continues. Salesforce -26% YTD.
      Thomson Reuters -20% week. Anthropic effect cascading through value chain.
    insurance_us: "ALL, GL modestly lower from recent peaks. No sector-specific catalyst."
    uk_small_caps: "Broad weakness continues. MONY.L new 52w low. AUTO.L near 52w low."
    telecom_eu: |
      DTE.DE +5.4% in 24h. Anticipation of TMUS Capital Markets Day (Feb 11 tomorrow).
      T-Mobile CEO Srini Gopalan to present 2026-2027 financial targets.
    reits: "VICI softening. Web sources show ~$28.53 (lower than price_checker $29.25)."

      vs_52w_high: "-35% (from 224.80)"
      vs_52w_low: "Near new low (139.70-145.80 range)"
      cause: |
        TWO separate ChatGPT insurance apps launched:
        1. Tuio Home (Spanish startup) - home insurance quotes directly inside ChatGPT
        2. Insurify - first insurance industry ChatGPT app for car insurance comparison
        Market fears AI chatbots will displace price comparison websites entirely.
        Bloomberg: "Insurance Broker Stocks Sink as AI App Sparks Disruption Fears"
        CityAM: "Money Supermarket shares tumble to 13-year low on AI fears"
      cause_type: SECTORIAL
      already_known: false
      thesis_impact: |
        NEW RISK VECTOR not in thesis: AI-as-distribution-channel for insurance.
        Thesis acknowledged digital competition but not ChatGPT as broker.
        HOWEVER: One Spanish insurer + one US insurer in ChatGPT != destruction of UK
        comparison ecosystem. UK market has specific dynamics:
        - FCA regulatory compliance (comparison sites are regulated)
        - 100+ insurer panel (vs 1-2 insurers in ChatGPT)
        - Brand trust (MoneySupermarket, MoneySavingExpert)
        - RBC analysts say impact "overstated"
        MATERIAL question: does this change structurally or is this a panic?
        EARNINGS FEB 23 will provide real data.
      mos_vs_fv: "+27-38% (FV 201 GBp, depending on actual close)"
      action: |
        HOLD through earnings Feb 23. This is likely panic selling.
        If earnings guidance shows NO AI impact on volumes: potential ADD opportunity.
        If earnings show early AI cannibalization: reassess thesis, consider EXIT.
        Do NOT add before earnings. Information asymmetry too high.

        Pre-TMUS Capital Markets Day rally. T-Mobile US will present Q4/FY2025
        results + 2026-2027 financial targets TOMORROW (Feb 11, 8:30am ET).
        CEO Srini Gopalan + leadership in NYC. DTE owns ~48.5% of TMUS.
        Strong TMUS targets would directly uplift DTE.DE valuation.
        Also: DTE.DE +13.44% vs prior week, +9.20% month change.

        Exit plan says "Check TMUS results Feb 11 TODAY" - correction: it is TOMORROW.
        If TMUS guides strong (subscriber growth, ARPU, FCF): DTE.DE rally continues.
        If TMUS disappoints: DTE.DE could give back gains rapidly.
        Current FV EUR 34.00. Price EUR 30.20-30.38 = MoS ~11%.
        APPROACHING fair value territory. TRIM threshold was >EUR 33.

      action: |
        MONITOR TMUS CMD results tomorrow morning carefully.
        If TMUS guides above consensus: DTE.DE could hit EUR 32-34 quickly.
        Per exit plan: TRIM >EUR 33. Be ready.
        Do NOT add. Already approaching FV.

      mos_vs_fv: "+45-47% (FV $390)"
      note: |
        Part of broader Anthropic/AI software selloff (-$285B in sector).
        Salesforce -26% YTD, Thomson Reuters -20% week. ADBE caught in same tide.
        FTC ROSCA lawsuit adds company-specific overhang.
        Per exit plan: no ADD until trial clarity (Oct 2026). 47% MoS provides large buffer.
        Web shows slight rebound from intraday low (+0.38% on day).

    - ticker: AUTO.L
      status: "NEAR 52-WEEK LOW"
      current: "478.70 GBp (price_checker)"

      vs_52w_low: "+1.9%"
      vs_52w_high: "-48.0%"
      note: |
        UK auto sentiment weakness. Drifting lower since purchase at 485.80.
        Web source shows conflicting data (751.47p) which appears to be adjusted price.
        Using price_checker as primary source. ADD trigger at 450 GBp.

    - ticker: EDEN.PA

      vs_52w_high: "-48.5-49.7%"
      mos_vs_fv: "+38-65% (FV EUR 29.00)"
      note: |
        Web data suggests lower close (EUR 17.58) than price_checker (EUR 18.00).
        Grinding downtrend continues. Earnings Feb 24 decisive.
        Analyst consensus target EUR 17.70 (eToro) - market very bearish.
        Strong MoS cushion regardless.

    - ticker: VICI
      status: "POSSIBLE NEGATIVE MoS (data conflict)"

      fair_value: "$29.00"
      mos: "-0.9% to +1.6% (depends on price source)"
      note: |
        IMPORTANT DATA CONFLICT: price_checker shows $29.25 (>FV = negative MoS),
        web sources show $28.53 (<FV = small positive MoS of 1.6%).
        Either way: essentially zero margin of safety.
        ON PROBATION. Earnings Feb 25 = mandatory SELL/HOLD decision.

    - ticker: UHS
      status: "ZERO MoS"
      current: "$212.39-212.78 (web $212.39, price_checker $212.78)"
      fair_value: "$213"
      mos: "+0.1-0.3%"
      note: |
        Effectively no margin of safety regardless of data source.
        ON PROBATION. Earnings Feb 25 = mandatory SELL/HOLD decision.
        OBBBA Medicaid cuts = structural forward risk.
        Web shows -0.18% on day. Flat trading.

    - ticker: BYIT.L
      status: "NEAR 52-WEEK LOW"
      current: "304.80-360.20 GBp (price_checker 304.80, web 356-360)"
      52w_low: "290.80 GBp (price_checker) / 318.00 (web)"
      note: |
        MAJOR DATA CONFLICT: price_checker shows 304.80, web sources show 356-360.
        Web 52w low is 318 (not 290.80). This needs investigation.
        If web is correct: stock is up +20% from purchase at 296, not +3%.
        Likely explanation: yfinance may be using different share class or ex-div data.
        NEEDS VERIFICATION in next session.

    - ticker: DOM.L
      status: "LOSS (deepening)"
      current: "181.22-197.10 GBp (web 181.22, price_checker 197.10)"
      avg_cost: "~208.9 GBp (calc: $2.49 * 100 / 1.1920 = ~209 GBp)"
      note: |
        DATA CONFLICT: web shows 181.22 (deeper loss) vs price_checker 197.10.
        If web is correct: P&L is -13.2%, not -5.6%. Significant difference.
        FY25 results Mar 5 approaching. FV 240 GBp. KC#1: EBITDA <125M.
        New CEO Dominic Paul starts Apr 6.
        NEEDS VERIFICATION in next session.

meta_reflection:
  movements_without_explanation: []

  correlations:
    - |
      UK small-cap cluster: MONY.L, AUTO.L, DOM.L, BYIT.L all near 52w lows.
      4/13 positions (31%) UK-listed. Correlated risk if UK recession.
      MONY.L hit hardest (-12.7%) on AI-specific fear, not UK macro.
    - |
      AI disruption theme (CROSS-PORTFOLIO RISK):
      MONY.L (-12.7% today), WKL.AS (-43% YoY), ADBE (at 52w low).
      Three names in our universe affected by same thematic risk.
      Anthropic tools triggered $285B wipeout in software/financial services.
      This is NOT just one company -- it is a structural market repricing of
      "businesses that intermediate information" (comparison, software, legal data).
      Our exposure: ADBE (direct), MONY.L (indirect), WKL.AS (watchlist).
      Combined portfolio weight of ADBE + MONY.L: ~8-9%.
    - |
      Fallen angel cluster: ADBE, NVO, LULU, AUTO.L, BYIT.L all >40% below 52w highs.
      This is by design (strategy), but concentration of beaten-down names = higher volatility.
    - |
      DTE.DE rallying while UK names sink. Geographic diversification providing some offset.

  data_anomalies:
    - |
      PRICE CHECKER vs WEB DIVERGENCE (4 tickers):
      BYIT.L: price_checker 304.80 vs web 356-360. Possible ex-div/share class issue.
      DOM.L: price_checker 197.10 vs web 181.22. Significant gap (8.8%).
      MONY.L: price_checker 152.80 vs web close 145.80-146.50. ~5% gap.
      VICI: price_checker $29.25 vs web $28.53. ~2.5% gap.
      POSSIBLE CAUSE: yfinance pulling delayed or intraday snapshots vs EOD close.
      Or: different data providers using different adjustment factors.
      ACTION: Verify with eToro positions tab for actual P&L.
    - "yfinance yield errors: UHS 38%, GL 76%. These are data artifacts."
    - "BATS.L P/E 31.4x seems too high. Verify vs actual earnings data."

      PRIORITY 1 (TOMORROW): Monitor TMUS Capital Markets Day results (8:30 AM ET).
      Direct impact on DTE.DE. If TMUS guides strong, DTE.DE could approach TRIM
      threshold of EUR 33. Be prepared to execute.
    - |
      PRIORITY 2 (THIS WEEK): ZIG.L 3.1% from standing order trigger (375 GBp).
      Prepare for execution if price drops.
    - |
      PRIORITY 3 (THIS WEEK): WKL.AS 1.1% from entry trigger (EUR 65).
      If it touches EUR 65, need thesis review BEFORE buying.
      Full-year results late Feb could be catalyst either way.
    - |
      PRIORITY 4 (THIS WEEK): BATS.L earnings Feb 12. Natural IMB.L replacement.
      Monitor results. If good + price dips toward 4,200 GBp, potential entry.
    - |
      MONY.L: AI fear selloff at 13-year low. Do NOT act before Feb 23 earnings.
      Key question: Is ChatGPT insurance app a real threat or panic?
      RBC says "overstated". But market disagrees violently.
      Earnings will reveal if volumes are actually impacted.
    - |
      VICI + UHS both at zero MoS with earnings Feb 25: these are the two positions
      most likely to exit the portfolio within 2 weeks. Prepare bear/base/bull scenarios.
    - |
      DATA QUALITY: 4 tickers show meaningful divergence between price_checker and web.
      Should investigate whether yfinance is reliable for UK-listed stocks in particular.
      Consider cross-referencing with eToro API or LSE data for UK positions.
    - |
      DNLM.L interims: PBT -7.5%, guided to lower end of consensus.
      Adversarial FV 1,008p still above current 959.50p (+5% MoS).
      Trigger 750-800p remains appropriate. No action needed.
