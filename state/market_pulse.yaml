    CRITICAL MACRO EVENT: January 2026 CPI -- TOMORROW (Feb 13)
    ===================================================
    SCHEDULED RELEASE: Feb 13, 2026, 08:30 ET (BLS)
    STATUS: NOT YET RELEASED. Any "2.9%" claim is UNVERIFIED/ERRONEOUS.

    LAST ACTUAL (Dec 2025): 2.7% headline YoY, 2.6% core YoY, 0.3% MoM headline, 0.2% MoM core
    CONSENSUS for Jan 2026: 2.5-2.6% headline YoY, 0.3% MoM core
    CLEVELAND FED NOWCAST: 2.36% headline, 2.45% core (as of Feb 10)

    NOTE: One web source (us-debt-clock.com) claims "2.7% inflation rate January 2026" but
    this is NOT from BLS and may be a nowcast or estimate, NOT the official release.
    BLS schedule confirms Feb 13 release. Do NOT trade on unverified data.

    SCENARIOS FOR TOMORROW:
    - HOT (>2.8% headline or >0.4% MoM core): Selloff likely, 10Y yield spike,
      VICI/growth hurt, insurance helped. VIX could spike above 25.
    - IN-LINE (2.5-2.6%): Relief rally, rates ease slightly. Neutral for portfolio.
    - COOL (<2.4%): Strong rally, rate cut hopes revive. Growth/REIT benefit.

    RECENT MACRO DATA:
    - Jan payrolls: +130K (vs +55K exp). Unemployment 4.3%. Labor market stronger than expected.
    - Retail sales: Soft. 10Y fell 6bp on this data. Consumer retrenchment signal.
    - Dallas Fed Logan: warned against premature rate cuts.
    - Gold $5,056 near ATH -- risk-off/inflation hedge bid.

    PORTFOLIO IMPLICATIONS:
    - VICI (REIT, ON PROBATION): Hot CPI = headwind. Already at FV. Feb 25 earnings critical.
    - DTE.DE (Telecom): Relatively insulated. Inflation-linked pricing.
    - Growth duration (ADBE at 52wL, NVO at P/E 13.3x, LULU at P/E 12.2x): Already deeply
      discounted. Higher rates marginal vs current multiples.
    - Insurance (ALL, GL): Higher rates = better float income. Positive.

  note: |
    The January 2026 CPI has NOT been released as of this pulse.
    Any figures claiming January CPI results are unverified and should be DISREGARDED.

# MORN Q4 2025 -- RESULTS PENDING
# =============================================================================
morn_q4_analysis:
  status: "RESULTS SCHEDULED after close Feb 12 -- NOT yet indexed in web search"
  consensus:
    eps: "$2.34-2.36"
    revenue: "$627-634M"
    revenue_growth_yoy: "6.2%"
  context: |
    MORN beat revenue by 2.4% last quarter (Q3: $617.4M, +8.4% YoY).
    Stock at $155.35, down ~53% from $330.55 high. At 52wL zone ($150).
    Our entry target: $145 (7.1% away).
    Buy-pipeline NOT started -- preliminary research only.
    QS 83 Tier A. 45% insider ownership. ROIC 20.5%.
  action_plan: |
    - If BEAT + positive guidance: Stock may rally away from $145 entry. Monitor for pullback later.
    - If MISS + selloff toward $145: Accelerate buy-pipeline (4 rounds). Standing order at $145 is PRELIMINARY -- needs full committee approval before execution.
    - If IN-LINE: Likely small move. Continue monitoring.
    NEXT STEP: Check results once indexed. Evaluate vs framework.

# DSY.PA POST-CRASH ANALYSIS
# =============================================================================
dsy_pa_analysis:
  status: "CRASHED -18% to -21% on Feb 11 2026 (worst day since 2002)"
  current_price_eur: 17.77
  standing_order_trigger: "EUR 15.50"
  distance_to_trigger: "+14.6%"
  crash_cause: |
    Q4 2025 results: software revenue DOWN 5% in Q4. Full year total revenue FLAT at EUR 6.24B.
    FY2026 guidance: 3-5% organic revenue growth (vs 5.9% analyst estimate).
    EBITDA margin expected under pressure.
    CNBC headline: "worst day ever" for DSY.PA.
    Bloomberg: shares plunge most since 2002 on weak outlook.
  implications_for_standing_order: |
    Standing order at EUR 15.50 was approved BEFORE Q4 miss and weak guidance.
    FV was EUR 20.00 based on expected growth normalization.
    With FY2026 guidance at only 3-5% organic growth:
    - FV may need downward revision to EUR 18-19 range.
    - At EUR 15.50 with revised FV EUR 18-19: MoS = 16-19% (vs original 22.5%).
    - Standing order CONDITIONS include: "Cancel if Q1 revenue growth <3%".
    - FY2026 guidance at 3-5% is BORDERLINE on this condition.
    RECOMMENDATION: Do NOT execute standing order yet. Wait for Q1 2026 results.
    The conditions on the standing order are protecting us here.

# META-REFLECTION

meta_reflection:
  moves_without_explanation:
    - "Prices largely UNCHANGED vs Session 62 pulse -- market in holding pattern pre-CPI."
    - "AUTO.L continuing grind toward absolute 52wL (468.6p) -- cause known (dealer revolt) but pace concerning."

  correlations_detected:
    - "AI DISRUPTION CROSS-PORTFOLIO: MONY.L (-14% from cost), ADBE (-5%), BYIT.L (-0.5%), DSY.PA (-18% standing order). 4 names impacted by same AI theme."
    - "UK CONCENTRATION STRESS: AUTO.L + BYIT.L + MONY.L all near 52wL simultaneously. 3 of 13 positions = correlated UK weakness."
    - "5 of 13 positions (38%) in stress: MONY.L/VICI/UHS/LULU ON PROBATION + AUTO.L/BYIT.L AT/NEAR 52W LOW."
    - "CPI NATURAL HEDGE: If CPI hot, insurance (ALL, GL) benefit while REIT (VICI) and growth suffer. Partial hedge in portfolio."
    - "52-WEEK LOW CLUSTER: ADBE, AUTO.L at absolute 52wL. BYIT.L, MONY.L, EDEN.PA near 52wL. 5 of 13 positions. This is either value opportunity or value trap signal -- thesis quality matters."

  data_anomalies:
    - "GL yield 75.0% -- yfinance error. Actual dividend yield ~2.1%."
    - "UHS yield 35.0% -- yfinance error. Actual ~0.5%."
    - "QQQ yield 45.0% -- yfinance error."
    - "MORN Q4 results NOT YET INDEXED despite being scheduled for after-close Feb 12. May take 12-24h to appear in search."

  action_items:
    - "PRIORITY 1 (TOMORROW): CPI Jan 2026 release at 08:30 ET. Monitor market reaction. Key for VICI, growth names, insurance."
    - "PRIORITY 2: MORN Q4 actual results -- evaluate once available. If miss + selloff toward $145, assess pipeline readiness."
    - "PRIORITY 3: Earnings week Feb 23-26 approaching: MONY.L (Feb 23), EDEN.PA (Feb 24), VICI + UHS (Feb 25), DTE.DE + INTU (Feb 26). All frameworks in place."
    - "PRIORITY 4: LULU governance -- MoS 10.3% thin given uncertainty. ON PROBATION through Mar 31."
    - "PRIORITY 5: DSY.PA standing order -- do NOT execute. Wait Q1 results. FV may need revision."
    - "PRIORITY 6: EDEN.PA Brazil regulation -- FV reassessment MANDATORY post Feb 24 earnings."

  suggestions:
    - "Hold new deployments until CPI digested. Cash at 44% provides optionality."
    - "EDEN.PA FV likely needs revision to EUR 25-27 if Brazil regulation sticks. MoS would compress from 39% to 29-34%."
    - "AUTO.L approaching absolute 52wL (468.6p). If breaks, next support unclear. Position small (3.4%)."
    - "5 positions ON PROBATION or flagged (38%) is high. Earnings week Feb 23-26 will resolve at least 3 (MONY.L, VICI, UHS). Prepare EXIT decisions."
