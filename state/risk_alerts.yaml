        NEW: Dupixent T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) lawsuits emerging. Multiple cases
        filed Dec 2025 - Jan 2026 (wrongful death in TN, cancer diagnosis in IL).
        MDL formation anticipated. Dupixent is 36% of Sanofi revenue (~EUR 13B).
        If causal link proven, could trigger Kill Condition #1 (Dupixent safety signal).
        ALSO: Regeneron suing Sanofi for breach of Dupixent collaboration agreement
        (access to PBM contract info). Financial impact unclear but relationship risk.

        NEW: ITG Brands (Imperial US subsidiary) owes ~$400M payment in 2026
        to Reynolds American tied to Florida tobacco settlement dispute. Delaware
        Supreme Court affirmed $251.5M judgment Dec 2025, appeal exhausted.
        Fitch includes ~$400M in 2026 assumptions. This is NOT in our thesis.

        UPDATE: Turkey Competition Authority investigating Edenred + Multinet +
        Pluxee + Setcard for price-fixing, collusive bidding, customer allocation.
        Probe launched Sep 2025. Turkey is ~2% of operating revenue but contributes
        disproportionately to growth due to hyperinflation. This is a THIRD
        regulatory market (after Brazil + Italy). Kill Condition #8 is
        "Regulation extends to 3rd major market."

        UPDATE: Caesars regional lease coverage now at $750M EBITDA vs $730M rent
        (1.03x). Multiple analyst downgrades (Evercore ISI, Wells Fargo). Rent
        reduction negotiations anticipated. If >10% rent cut, this triggers
        suggested Kill Condition from adversarial review. JP Morgan flagging the
        risk. ~25% of VICI NOI at stake.
