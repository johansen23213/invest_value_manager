        ESCALATED (2026-02-13): SECOND see-through leggings incident in <1 month.
        First: "Get Low" leggings pulled Jan 2026, reintroduced with disclaimers
        ("size up, wear skin-toned underwear"). Second: "Heart Scatter" leggings
        called out on Reddit Feb 12. Bloomberg: "See-Through Leggings Scandal
        Deepens Investor Activism." Jefferies warned "premium narrative becomes
        harder to defend." Company blamed customers for wearing wrong size.
        SIMULTANEOUSLY: No CEO (since Jan 31), bonuses below target (Feb 11
        Bloomberg), Chip Wilson proxy fight + Elliott $1B activist + annual
        meeting proxy vote June 2026. Stock -55% from highs.
        This is a CLUSTER of simultaneous risks: product quality + governance
        vacuum + activist pressure + brand erosion. Each alone is manageable;
        together they compound.

        BRAZIL: Decree caps merchant discount at 3.6% (interchange 2%), settlement
        reduced to 15 days (from ~30). Bans exclusivity/rebates. EBITDA impact
        estimated EUR 150-200M (-8% to -12% on 2026 growth). Company preparing
        legal remedies.
        TURKEY: Antitrust investigation ongoing (price-fixing, collusive bidding).
        ITALY: EUR 120M/yr impact ongoing.
        FRANCE: 8% social levy on meal vouchers PROPOSED but NOT confirmed.
        Political fragmentation makes timeline uncertain. Feb 24 earnings will
        reveal 2026 guidance incorporating Brazil decree.

        KC#8 (regulation extends to 3rd major market) - Turkey is antitrust not
        interchange, so technically distinct. But PATTERN of 4 jurisdictions is
        concerning. France 8% levy would be KC#8 trigger if confirmed.
        KC#6 (2027-28 guidance <5%) - Feb 24 earnings will test this.
      recommendation: >
        HOLD through Feb 24 earnings. If 2026 EBITDA guidance <-12% or 2027-28
        growth guide <5%, evaluate EXIT per KC#6. France levy remains proposal
        only. Monitor Feb 24 closely.

        IMDA claims 165 cancellations. Deal Builder mandatory rollout Nov 2025
        was "the straw that broke the camel's back." Dealers explicitly stated
        they are constructing a CMA complaint.
        Auto Trader responding: Customer Advisory Groups launched Manchester +
        London. "Reservation Request" feature launching early 2026 as alternative
        to mandatory Reserve Now. CEO Nathan Coe held Q&A webinar.

      description: >
        NEW (2026-02-13): Significant insider selling pattern detected.
        Feb 6: EVP/Chief Strategy Officer Michael Clay Majors sold $4.4M
        (30,790 shares, 39% of his position). Price range $146-$148.
        Feb 6: Director Mark Blinn sold $259K (1,750 shares).
        Both sales occurred DAYS after Q4 earnings (Feb 4).
        Post-earnings insider selling is legal and common (10b5-1 plans),
        but EVP selling 39% of position is notable.
        POSITIVE: SEC/DOJ investigations CLOSED. AM Best affirmed A (Excellent).

        expectations. DELTEK unit: 2026 outlook assumes NO improvement from

# Riesgos correlacionados (updated)
correlated_risks:
  - description: "Governance vacuum cluster"
    tickers: [LULU, DOM.L]
    detail: >
      2 positions have CEO transitions simultaneously. LULU has no CEO since
      Jan 31 (co-interim CEOs). DOM.L has new CEO Dominic Paul starting Apr 6.
      Governance transitions increase execution risk. Both positions are LOW
      conviction.

  - description: "AI disruption wave 2026"
    tickers: [MONY.L, BYIT.L, ADBE]
    detail: >
      3 positions affected by AI disruption narrative. MONY.L (Insurify ChatGPT),
      BYIT.L (Microsoft AI self-service licensing), ADBE (AI creative automation).
      Plus pipeline: DSY.PA, INTU. This is a SECTOR-WIDE theme, not company-specific.
      SaaSpocalypse narrative intensifying. Combined exposure ~15% of portfolio.

  - description: "UK concentration risk (4 positions)"
    tickers: [MONY.L, AUTO.L, BYIT.L, DOM.L]
    detail: >
      4 of 11 positions are UK-listed. MONY.L (ON PROBATION + AI disruption),
      AUTO.L (dealer revolt + CMA risk), BYIT.L (Microsoft headwind),
      DOM.L (CEO transition + consumer weakness). UK post-Brexit regulatory
      divergence + GBP weakness + consumer caution. 2 of 4 have degraded moats.
      Greenland tariff threat REVERSED but UK trade uncertainty persists.

  - description: "Regulatory multi-jurisdictional pattern"
    tickers: [EDEN.PA]
    detail: >
      Brazil (decree ACTIVE), Italy (EUR 120M/yr ACTIVE), Turkey (antitrust
      ACTIVE), France (8% levy PROPOSED). 4 jurisdictions with regulatory
      pressure. Business model systematically attracts regulatory scrutiny.
      Feb 24 earnings will reveal management's strategy to navigate.

  - description: "Tariff/geopolitical risk for EU/UK positions"
    tickers: [DTE.DE, EDEN.PA, AUTO.L, MONY.L, BYIT.L, DOM.L]
    detail: >
      Greenland tariff threat reversed Jan 21, but 25% escalation threatened
      by Jun 1 if no deal. EU has 93bn EUR retaliatory package ready.
      UK separately exposed. Impact on our positions: mostly indirect
      (consumer confidence, currency) rather than direct tariff exposure.
