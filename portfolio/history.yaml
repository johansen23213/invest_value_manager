    fv_reached: false
    quality_score: 36  # Borderline Tier C/D
    thesis_accuracy:
      correct: false
      notes: "Original thesis overestimated FV using P/FCF without mid-cycle adjustment. v2.0 re-evaluation showed stock was fairly valued (MoS -3.5%). QS 36 = borderline Tier C/D. Capital better deployed in Tier A compounders. EXIT Protocol 6/6 gates -> SELL. Small gain (+2.3%) despite thesis being wrong on upside."
    exit_reason: thesis_invalidated  # Quality too low + no MoS + better opportunity (AUTO.L)
    lesson_learned: "For cyclicals, EV/EBIT mid-cycle is the correct valuation method, not P/FCF. QS 36 is borderline - capital should be in Tier A/B. EXIT Protocol works: systematic evaluation led to correct rotation decision."

      notes: "Framework v3.0 Tier D violation. QS 32/100 = DO NOT HOLD. Value trap 4/10 factors (secular decline, tech disruption, ROIC<WACC, high goodwill). MoS was 46-53% but quality insufficient. Disciplined exit to redeploy capital to Tier A/B compounders."
    exit_reason: thesis_invalidated  # Framework v3.0 upgrade revealed quality issue
    lesson_learned: "v2.0 portfolio built on P/E+yield screening missed quality dimension. Framework v3.0 Quality Score is essential filter BEFORE valuation."
