    thesis_accuracy:
      correct: false
      notes: "Original thesis overestimated FV using P/FCF without mid-cycle adjustment. v2.0 re-evaluation showed stock was fairly valued (MoS -3.5%). QS 36 = borderline Tier C/D. Capital better deployed in Tier A compounders. EXIT Protocol 6/6 gates -> SELL. Small gain (+2.3%) despite thesis being wrong on upside."
    exit_reason: thesis_invalidated  # Quality too low + no MoS + better opportunity (AUTO.L)
    lesson_learned: "For cyclicals, EV/EBIT mid-cycle is the correct valuation method, not P/FCF. QS 36 is borderline - capital should be in Tier A/B. EXIT Protocol works: systematic evaluation led to correct rotation decision."

      notes: "Framework v3.0 Tier D violation. QS 32/100 = DO NOT HOLD. Value trap 4/10 factors (secular decline, tech disruption, ROIC<WACC, high goodwill). MoS was 46-53% but quality insufficient. Disciplined exit to redeploy capital to Tier A/B compounders."
    exit_reason: thesis_invalidated  # Framework v3.0 upgrade revealed quality issue
    lesson_learned: "v2.0 portfolio built on P/E+yield screening missed quality dimension. Framework v3.0 Quality Score is essential filter BEFORE valuation."

      notes: "Capital rotation decision. QS 46 Tier C with ROIC < WACC. MoS was high (38-51%) but revised down to 17% post re-evaluation. AI disruption accelerating. Capital better deployed in Tier A compounders (BYIT.L QS 81). Earnings Feb 26 not waited for."
    exit_reason: capital_rotation_to_tier_a
    lesson_learned: "Tier C positions with high MoS but ROIC < WACC and structural disruption risk should be rotated to Tier A when opportunities arise. MoS alone does not compensate for quality deficit."

    thesis_accuracy:
      correct: false
      notes: "Original FV EUR 26.73 was overoptimistic. v3.0 revised to EUR 21.90 post Q4 miss (-17% EPS). Thesis debilitated 2/3 pillars (revenue stabilization failed, ROIC < WACC persistent). On probation awaiting CMD June 23. Took profits (+13.7%) and rotated capital to Tier A (BYIT.L)."
    exit_reason: capital_rotation_to_tier_a
    lesson_learned: "Take profits when thesis weakens materially even if position is small. Probation status with thin MoS (8.4%) and ROIC < WACC is not worth waiting for a catalyst 4.5 months away when Tier A opportunities exist now."

    thesis_accuracy:
      correct: false
      notes: "Original FV $32-35 was overestimated (P/E method without WACC derivation). v2.0 revised to $27.74 using DCF+DDM. At $27.22 exit, stock was near fair value (MoS -3.2% = slightly overvalued). ROIC 7% < WACC 8%. Patent cliff 2026-28 structural risk. Capital rotated to Tier A (BYIT.L)."
    exit_reason: capital_rotation_to_tier_a
    lesson_learned: "Positions near fair value with ROIC < WACC and structural headwinds (patent cliff) should be rotated when Tier A opportunities arise. Yield alone (6.5%) does not justify holding when quality is Tier C and MoS is negative."
