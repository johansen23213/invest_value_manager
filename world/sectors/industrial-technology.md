# Sector: Industrial Technology

> Ultima actualizacion: 2026-02-12
> Status: **NEUTRAL -- Selective opportunities in quality compounders at discounted prices**

## Resumen Ejecutivo

Industrial Technology encompasses high-quality, asset-light industrial businesses that combine precision engineering, software, and recurring services. The sector includes serial acquirers of niche industrial businesses (Roper, Halma, Diploma, Judges Scientific, Lifco), precision instruments and test/measurement (Mettler-Toledo, AMETEK, Nordson), specialty industrial components and fluid handling (Graco, IDEX, Rotork), and environmental/water technology (Xylem, Veralto, Watts Water).

The best companies in this sector share several characteristics that make them exceptional compounders: high gross margins (50-70%), asset-light business models, mission-critical products embedded in customer workflows, regulatory-driven demand (safety, environmental), high switching costs, and significant recurring/repeat revenue. These businesses are effectively "toll booths" on industrial activity.

**Current opportunity:** Several quality compounders have experienced significant drawdowns from 52-week highs. Roper Technologies (-44%) has been hit by temporary Deltek government shutdown impact, muted freight cycle (DAT), and AI uncertainty narrative. Judges Scientific (-46%) faces US federal research funding headwinds. Fortive (-28%) and Xylem (-18%) are also trading well below recent peaks. Meanwhile, the highest-quality names (Graco, Rotork, AMETEK) are near all-time highs, reflecting market recognition of their quality.

**Tesis sectorial:** This is a sector where quality truly compounds -- ROIC consistently above WACC, stable/growing margins, and resilient demand. The best entry points come from temporary sector/company-specific headwinds, not secular problems. The key risk is valuation: these businesses are rarely "cheap" by traditional metrics (P/E 25-40x), so the MoS comes from understanding the durability of the compounding.

## Estructura Competitiva

**Concentracion:** Fragmented by subsector, oligopolistic within niches
**Top 5 by quality (ROIC):** Mettler-Toledo, Graco, Rotork, VLTO/NDSN

| Subsector | Key Players | Characteristics |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Serial Acquirers (US) | Roper, Danaher, Fortive | Platform models, software-heavy |
| Serial Acquirers (UK) | Halma, Diploma, Judges Scientific | Regulation-driven niches |
| Serial Acquirers (Nordic) | Lifco, Addtech, Lagercrantz, Indutrade | Decentralized holdco model |
| Precision Instruments | Mettler-Toledo, AMETEK | Extreme ROIC, laboratory/industrial |
| Specialty Dispensing/Coating | Nordson, Graco | High switching costs, aftermarket |
| Flow Control | Rotork, IDEX | Actuators, pumps, safety-critical |
| Water/Environmental Tech | Xylem, Veralto, Watts Water | Regulation-driven growth |

**Barreras de entrada:** Alta
- Regulatory certifications (safety, environmental)
- Customer qualification processes (years to approve)
- Installed base + aftermarket lock-in
- Niche expertise difficult to replicate
- Distribution networks built over decades

## Ciclo y Sensibilidad

| Factor | Sensibilidad | Notas |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Tipos de interes | Media | Asset-light models less affected; but valuation sensitive |
| Recesion | Baja-Media | Regulation-driven demand resilient; project-based less so |
| Inflacion | Baja | Strong pricing power passes through costs |
| Capex Cycles | Media | New installations cyclical; aftermarket/service stable |

**Mejor fase del ciclo:** All (defensive quality with cyclical upside)
**Beta tipico:** 0.8-1.1 (lower than broad industrials)

## Disrupcion y Riesgos

### Tecnologicos
| Amenaza | Probabilidad | Impacto | Timeline |
|---------|--------------|---------|----------|
| AI disruption to software businesses | Media | Media | 3-5 anos |
| Chinese competition in instruments | Baja-Media | Baja | 5+ anos |
| Digital twins/simulation | Media | Positivo para lideres | 3-5 anos |

### Regulatorios
| Regulacion | Probabilidad | Impacto |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| Environmental standards tightening | Alta | Positivo (drives demand) |
| Safety regulation expansion | Alta | Positivo (drives demand) |
| US federal research funding uncertainty | Media | Negativo for JDG.L, mixed for others |
| Tariff disruption (US-China) | Media | Mixed, depends on supply chain |

### Competitivos
- **Nuevos entrantes:** Rare in niche industrial tech (barriers too high)
- **Sustitutos:** Limited -- these are often the only approved solution
- **M&A competition:** Increasing prices for quality acquisitions

## Sentimiento de Mercado

**Sentimiento actual:** Mixed -- quality at premium, value in selected fallen names

**Narrativa dominante:**
"Industrial quality compounders are expensive but worth it. The few that are down (Roper, Judges) have real near-term problems. Better to pay up for the ones executing."

**Mi contra-tesis:**
"The market is right that Graco/Rotork/AMETEK are great businesses, but at near-ATH they offer no MoS. The opportunity is in the quality compounders that have temporary headwinds (Roper at -44% with 80% recurring software revenue, Judges at -46% with US funding headwind). For serial acquirer models, reported ROIC is misleading due to goodwill -- the actual business economics are excellent."

**Flujos de fondos (12m):** Mixed -- outflows from Roper, inflows to AMETEK/GGG

### Para analisis profundo (Tier A candidates with MoS)

| Ticker | Empresa | QS Tool | ROIC-WACC | Dist 52wH | Razon | Priority |
|--------|---------|---------|-----------|-----------|-------|----------|
| ROP | Roper Technologies | 48* | distorted by goodwill | -44% | 75-80% recurring software, 70% GM, $2.3B FCF, temporary headwinds (Deltek gov shutdown, DAT freight). QS distorted by goodwill -- adjusted QS likely 70-78. Needs full pipeline. | **Alta** |
| JDG.L | Judges Scientific | 65 | +1.5pp | -46% | UK serial acquirer of scientific instruments, 69% GM, 15.5% insider ownership. US research funding headwinds temporary. Small cap (GBP 330M) = less efficient. EPS guidance 200-250p vs share 4950p = P/E 20-25x on trough. | **Alta** |
| GGG | Graco Inc. | 71 | +13.3pp | -1% | Near Tier A quality (71), net cash, 24% FCF margin, 53% GM. But near ATH -- no MoS. Monitor for pullback to $75-80 range. | **Media (watchlist)** |
| ROR.L | Rotork plc | 73 | +12.7pp | -0.3% | Near Tier A quality (73), net cash, 22% ROIC, flow control niche. But at ATH -- no MoS. Monitor for pullback to 300-320p. | **Media (watchlist)** |
| DPLM.L | Diploma plc | 69 | +4.5pp | -5% | UK serial acquirer/distributor, 14.6% rev CAGR, 22% EPS CAGR, improving ROIC trajectory. But still near highs. Monitor for pullback to 4500p. | **Media (watchlist)** |

### Monitoring (Interesting but currently expensive or lower quality)

| Ticker | Empresa | QS Tool | Reason |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| HLMA.L | Halma plc | 64 | Quality but ROIC-WACC only +4pp, near ATH |
| NDSN | Nordson Corp | 56 | Good margins but slow growth, ROIC-WACC only +1.9pp |
| MTD | Mettler-Toledo | 56 | Phenomenal ROIC (+26pp) but P/E 33x, low growth, 0 dividend |
| IEX | IDEX Corp | 46 | ROIC declining from 17% to 11%, slow growth |
| XYL | Xylem Inc | 57 | ROIC < WACC (-3.3pp), Evoqua integration risk, -18% from high |
| VLTO | Veralto Corp | 52 | Danaher spinoff, ROIC 25%, but limited history, -14% |
| FTV | Fortive Corp | 36 | Low quality score, ROIC < WACC, -28% from high |

### Nordic Serial Acquirers (Monitoring)

| Ticker | Empresa | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| LIFCO-B.ST | Lifco AB | Swedish serial acquirer, SEK 312, ~SEK 55B mcap |
| ADDT-B.ST | Addtech AB | Swedish tech distributor, SEK 316, ~SEK 87B mcap |
| LAGR-B.ST | Lagercrantz Group | Swedish holdco, SEK 207, ~SEK 44B mcap |
| INDT.ST | Indutrade AB | Swedish industrial components, SEK 232 |

Note: Nordic serial acquirers typically trade at 30-50x P/E reflecting quality compounding, but currently lack significant discount. Need dedicated screening with quality_scorer when yfinance rate limit resets.

### Evitar

| Ticker | Razon |
|--------|-------|
| Chinese industrial pure-plays | Quality/governance concerns |
| Over-leveraged industrials | Cycle risk with debt |
| Low-margin commodity industrials | No moat, commoditization risk |
| FTV (Fortive) | QS 36, ROIC < WACC, quality insufficient |
