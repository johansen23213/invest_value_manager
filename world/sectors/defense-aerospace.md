# Sector: Defense & Aerospace

> Ultima actualizacion: 2026-02-13
> Status: NEUTRAL (selective — quality compounders at fair value, not cheap)

## Resumen Ejecutivo

Defense & Aerospace is experiencing a structural spending upcycle driven by geopolitical fragmentation (Ukraine war, NATO 2%+ GDP targets, Taiwan risk, Middle East). European defense budgets are growing ~6.8% annually through 2035, outpacing US (1.7%), Russia (3.2%), and China (3.1%). The global A&D market is projected to grow from ~$847B (2025) to ~$1.19T (2030) at 7.1% CAGR.

However, the sector has already re-rated significantly. European defense stocks rallied ~260% since Russia's Feb 2022 invasion. Most quality names trade at 30-85x P/E, well above historical averages. The investment opportunity here is NOT "buy the sector cheap" but rather "identify which sub-segments and companies have durable competitive advantages worth owning through cycles." The best quality lives in aerospace aftermarket (TDG, HEI), engine duopolies (SAF.PA, GE), defense technology/sensors (HO.PA, AM.PA), and niche nuclear/specialty (BWXT, CW).

**US Government IT Services sub-sector note:** Companies like BAH, LDOS, SAIC, CACI operate in a distinct sub-segment (government consulting/IT services) that is affected by DOGE contract cuts and is currently cheap (P/E 11-25x) vs the broader defense sector. BAH is the quality leader with 22K cleared workforce and AI business growing 30%+.

Key risk: if geopolitical tensions de-escalate meaningfully (Ukraine ceasefire, US-China detente), the narrative could reverse quickly. Budget commitments are multi-year, but sentiment can shift overnight. Companies with high aftermarket/recurring revenue are more resilient than those dependent on new program wins.

## Disrupcion y Riesgos

### Tecnologicos
| Amenaza | Probabilidad | Impacto | Timeline |
|---------|--------------|---------|----------|
| AI/autonomous systems | Alta | Positive for tech-leaders, negative for manpower-heavy | 5-10yr |
| Drones replacing manned aircraft | Media | Long-term shift, but slow adoption | 10-20yr |
| Cyber warfare shift | Alta | Benefits Thales, Leidos, Elbit, L3Harris | Now |
| Hypersonics | Media | New market, benefits NOC, LMT, Raytheon | 3-5yr |

### Regulatorios
| Regulacion | Probabilidad | Impacto |
|------------|--------------|---------|

### Competitivos
- Nuevos entrantes: Minimal in prime contracts; emerging in drones (Kratos, AeroVironment, Joby)
- Sustitutos: Cyber/AI defense can substitute kinetic in some scenarios
- China defense industry improving but export market remains limited

## Sentimiento de Mercado

**Sentimiento actual:** Querido / Near-Burbuja (particularly EU defense)
**Exception:** US govcon IT services (BAH, LDOS, SAIC) are ODIADO due to DOGE -- P/E 11-16x

**Narrativa dominante:**
"Europe must rearm. NATO 2%+ GDP. Multi-decade spending supercycle. Defense is the new tech."

**Mi contra-tesis:**
"The narrative is correct directionally, but the market has front-run 5-10 years of growth into current valuations. Most EU defense stocks trade at 50-85x P/E when historical is 15-25x. If a Ukraine ceasefire occurs or budget growth disappoints, a 30-50% correction is plausible. The better opportunity is in US aftermarket monopolies (TDG, HEI) where the moat is structural, not geopolitical, and in Dassault Aviation (AM.PA) which has a rare combination of Tier A quality, family ownership, and net cash. Additionally, US govcon IT services (BAH) are deeply out of favor due to DOGE -- BAH at P/E 11.9x with ROIC 23.6% and $38B backlog may be a contrarian opportunity."

**Flujos de fondos (12m):** Strong Inflows (EU defense ETFs +65% in 2025, ITA +40%)

## Key Observations from Screening

1. **Valuation is the constraint, not quality.** Several Tier A/B companies exist but trade at 40-85x P/E. The sector is "Querido" not "Odiado."

2. **Best quality-for-price:** AM.PA (Dassault Aviation) stands out -- Tier A quality, 77.5% family ownership, net cash of EUR 9.4B (~37% of market cap), and trades at P/E 33x which is the lowest multiple for any Tier A candidate.

3. **Aftermarket monopolies are the moat play:** TDG and HEI have structural moats (sole-source proprietary parts with no substitutes). These moats are NOT dependent on geopolitics. However, valuations are extreme (42x and 68x P/E).

4. **EU defense is most expensive:** RHM.DE at 85x, SAAB-B.ST at 55x. Growth is real but priced in. A correction of 30-50% would make these interesting.

5. **Cheapest quality name:** IDR.MC (Indra) at P/E 23x with QS 65, 50% insider ownership, and NATO growth exposure. Worth deeper analysis.

6. **Serial acquirer adjustment needed for TDG:** Like ROP in our portfolio, TDG's ROIC is distorted by goodwill. True economic ROIC is likely higher. Could adjust to Tier A with proper protocol.

7. **US govcon IT is the contrarian play:** BAH at P/E 11.9x with ROIC 23.6% and WIDE moat (22K cleared workforce, $38B backlog) is the cheapest quality name in the broader defense sector. DOGE creates the discount. Entry at $70 provides 26% MoS.
