# Sector: Semiconductors & Equipment

> Ultima actualizacion: 2026-02-13
> Status: NEUTRAL - Quality compounders exist but valuations are generally stretched

## Resumen Ejecutivo

The semiconductor equipment and specialty chip sector contains some of the highest-quality businesses in the world -- oligopolistic market structures, extreme switching costs, and multi-decade secular growth driven by AI, automotive electrification, IoT, and advanced packaging. Equipment companies in particular are "picks-and-shovels" plays on chip manufacturing buildout, with asset-light models that generate exceptional returns on capital.

However, the sector trades at elevated valuations across the board. The AI narrative has lifted equipment names significantly. P/E ratios of 30-50x are the norm even for the best businesses. The opportunity lies in cyclical downturns (the sector is deeply cyclical despite secular growth) or in finding less-covered names where the moat is underappreciated.

Key sub-sectors: Lithography (ASML monopoly), Etch/Deposition (LRCX/AMAT/TEL oligopoly), Process Control/Inspection (KLAC/ONTO), EDA Tools (SNPS/CDNS duopoly), Analog/Specialty (TXN/ADI/MCHP/NXPI), Power Management (MPWR), Advanced Packaging (BESI/KLIC/ASMPT), Materials (ENTG/MKSI), Testing (COHU/ONTO).

| Sub-sector | Dominant Player(s) | Market Share | Moat Type |
|------------|-------------------|--------------|-----------|
| EUV Lithography | ASML | ~100% | Monopoly, IP, cost advantage |
| Etch | LRCX, TEL, AMAT | ~90% (3 players) | Oligopoly, switching costs |
| Deposition | AMAT, LRCX, TEL | ~85% (3 players) | Oligopoly, switching costs |

**Barreras de entrada:** Extremely High
- R&D intensity: Equipment companies spend 15-25% of revenue on R&D
- Cumulative IP: Decades of process know-how, thousands of patents
- Customer qualification: 12-24 month qualification cycles at fabs
- Capital requirements: Billions needed for new entrants
- Network effects in EDA: Entire ecosystem built around SNPS/CDNS tools

## Ciclo y Sensibilidad

| Factor | Sensibilidad | Notas |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Capex cycles | VERY HIGH | Equipment revenue swings 20-40% in cycles |
| Tipos de interes | Media | Affects fab capex decisions |
| Recesion | Alta | Chip demand falls, fab capex deferred |
| AI investment cycle | VERY HIGH | Current primary growth driver |
| Geopolitics/Trade | VERY HIGH | US-China restrictions, CHIPS Act |

**Mejor fase del ciclo:** Mid-cycle (when fabs expand) or secular shift (AI/EV transitions)
**Beta tipico:** 1.3-1.8 (high beta sector). Exception: EDA (CDNS/SNPS) beta ~1.0 due to subscription model.
**Cycle position (Feb 2026):** Mid-to-late cycle. Capex boom fueled by AI. Equipment names near all-time highs. Analog segment recovering from inventory correction.

## Disrupcion y Riesgos

### Tecnologicos
| Amenaza | Probabilidad | Impacto | Timeline |
|---------|--------------|---------|----------|
| AI reducing chip demand | Very Low | Low | >10 years |
| Gate-all-around transition | High | Positive for equipment | 2-3 years |
| Advanced packaging growth | High | Positive for BESI/ASMPT | 2-5 years |
| Chiplets disrupting monolithic | Medium | Positive for testing/packaging | 3-5 years |
| Quantum computing | Very Low | Unknown | >10 years |

### Regulatorios
| Regulacion | Probabilidad | Impacto |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| US-China export controls (ASML/LRCX/AMAT) | Ongoing | Revenue reduction 5-15% |
| CHIPS Act subsidies (US/EU/Japan) | Ongoing | Positive for equipment demand |
| Tariff escalation | Medium | Negative for supply chains |
| Antitrust scrutiny (SNPS-Ansys merger) | Low-Medium | SNPS specific |

### Competitivos
- Nuevos entrantes: NAURA (China domestic equipment) -- threat to low-end market only
- Sustitutos: None for advanced equipment. Chinese substitution for mature nodes.
- Key risk: Over-investment in AI leading to capex hangover (similar to fiber optics 2001)

## Sentimiento de Mercado

**Sentimiento actual:** Between Querido and Burbuja -- AI narrative dominates

**Narrativa dominante:**
"AI requires massive chip buildout, equipment is the picks-and-shovels play, secular growth with structural moats."

**Mi contra-tesis (si aplica):**
"The narrative is DIRECTIONALLY CORRECT but valuations have overshot. Equipment P/Es at 35-50x are pricing in perfection. The sector is deeply cyclical -- capex hangovers happen. The opportunity will come when the cycle turns or when a correction creates reasonable entry points. Within the sector, the structural moats are real but some names offer better risk-adjusted returns than others."

**Flujos de fondos (12m):** Strong inflows into SMH/SOXX ETFs. Equipment names near all-time highs.

## Screening Summary

**Total companies screened:** 25+
**Companies I did NOT know before screening:** ACLS (Axcelis), COHU, ONTO, COTN.SW, 6146.T (Disco)
**QS >= 65 companies:** ASML (81), CDNS (74 tool / 82 adj), MPWR (68), KLAC (67), LRCX (64), AMAT (64)
**Anti-bias check:** Included European (BESI, ASM, Aixtron, IFX, STM, Comet), Japanese (Disco, TEL), and US mid-caps (ACLS, ONTO, COHU, KLIC)

**Sector thesis:** The moats are real and among the best in any industry. But valuations are stretched. The best strategy is to build a watchlist, understand the businesses deeply, and wait for cyclical corrections to create entry points. ASML and CDNS stand out as the highest quality, KLAC as most underappreciated quality.
