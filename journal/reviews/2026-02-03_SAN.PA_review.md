## Key Changes from v1.0 to v2.0

### 1. Business Analysis Framework Added
- Explicit "Why Is It Cheap?" section with contra-thesis
- Value trap checklist (0/10 factors = PASS)
- Informational advantage documented

### 2. Projection Framework with WACC Derivation
```
Original: WACC = 8% (assumed)
v2.0: WACC = 5.63% (derived) → Applied 8% (floor per rules)

Derivation:
- Rf = 2.4% (EUR 10Y)
- Beta = 0.65 (pharma typical)
- ERP = 5.5%
- Ke = 5.98%
- Kd = 3.0% after-tax
- Weights: 88.5% equity, 11.5% debt
```

### 3. Multi-Method Valuation
Original relied heavily on P/E multiples with DCF as "sanity check."

v2.0 uses:
- DCF (40% weight): EUR 92-174 range
- DDM (60% weight): EUR 102-165 range
- Combined: EUR 98-168 range

Higher DDM weight because Sanofi is dividend aristocrat (26 years).

### 4. Macro Fit Section Added
- Verified against world/current_view.md
- Pharma neutral sentiment
- Not directly affected by Korea tariffs
- Demographics favorable

## Conclusion

2. Value trap checklist PASSED (0/10 factors)
3. MoS improved from ~22% to 34%
4. All thesis elements remain intact
5. Macro fit is neutral-positive
