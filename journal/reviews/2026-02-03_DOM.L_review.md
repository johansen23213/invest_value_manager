## Key Findings

### 1. Value Trap Checklist: PASSED (0.5/10 factors)
Only partial flag for management (CEO departure). All other factors clear:
- No secular decline
- No tech disruption
- Balance sheet stable
- Market share growing
- ROIC >> WACC
- FCF consistently positive

### 2. WACC Derivation
Derived WACC of 7.6% (raw) adjusted to 8.5% for conservatism:
- Ke: 9.2% (Rf 4.2% + Beta 1.0 x ERP 5.0%)
- Kd after-tax: 3.7%
- E/V: 71.4%, D/V: 28.6%

Lower than default 9% because asset-light model has lower operating risk.

### 3. Growth Derivation
Derived 3.5% from TAM + share gains + pricing, used 3% conservatively.
Lower than default 5% but more defensible.

### 4. Multi-Method Valuation
- DCF: 285p expected
- EV/EBIT: 303p expected
- Weighted (50/50): 294p
- Divergence: 6% (acceptable <30%)

### 5. Net Effect
Lower WACC (+) offsets lower growth (-). Net: +10% to fair value.
MoS improves from 32% to 37.6%.
