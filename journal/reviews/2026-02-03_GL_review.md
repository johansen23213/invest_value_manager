# GL (Globe Life) - Framework v2.0 Re-evaluation Review

**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Reviewer:** Review Agent
**Position Status:** ACTIVE (opened 2026-02-03)
**Trigger:** Framework v2.0 implementation - regularization of existing thesis

---

## Executive Summary

Re-evaluated GL position using the new Framework v2.0 which requires:
1. Business Analysis Framework (unit economics, why cheap, value trap checklist)
2. Projection Framework (derived WACC, no defaults)
3. Multi-method valuation (P/B vs ROE + P/E normalized for insurance)
4. 7 Gates validation

**Result: More conservative Fair Value. HOLD instead of BUY at current prices.**

## Comparison: Original vs v2.0

| Metric | Original (v1.0) | v2.0 | Delta |
|--------|-----------------|------|-------|
| **Fair Value** | $215 | $174 | -19% |
| **Margin of Safety** | 34.4% | 17.6% | -16.8pp |
| **Quality Score** | 6.5/10 | 7/10 | +0.5 |
| **Tier** | B | B | Same |
| **Required MoS** | 25% | 25% | Same |
| **Verdict** | BUY | **HOLD** | Changed |

## Why Fair Value Dropped

### Original v1.0 Methodology:
- Relied heavily on DCF ($233-$379 range)
- Used earnings-based blended approach
- Adopted $215 as "conservative blend"

### v2.0 Methodology:
- Used P/B vs ROE (60% weight) - appropriate for financial
- Used P/E normalized (40% weight)
- DCF only as sanity check (not weighted)
- More conservative EPS multiple (11.5x vs implied 14x in original)

### Key Driver of Difference:
Original thesis used DCF which showed massive upside ($259 base case). Framework v2.0 correctly notes that DCF for insurers is less reliable due to lumpy FCF and reserve accounting. P/B vs ROE is the more appropriate primary method.

The v2.0 Fair Value of $174 uses:
- Conservative P/E of 11.5x on forward EPS of $15.03
- This accounts for residual litigation uncertainty
- Peers trade at 14-15x but GL still has overhang

## Value Trap Checklist Result

**Score: 0/10 - CLEARLY NOT A VALUE TRAP**

All 10 factors negative:
- No secular decline
- No tech disruption
- Management not destroying value
- Balance sheet stable
- No insider selling
- Dividend increasing
- Market share stable
- ROIC >> WACC
- FCF strongly positive
- Minimal goodwill

This is one of the cleanest value trap checklists in the portfolio.

## WACC Derivation (v2.0 requirement)

```
Rf (10Y Treasury): 4.28%
Beta: 0.464
ERP: 5.0%
Ke = 4.28% + 0.464 x 5.0% = 6.6%

Kd after-tax: 3.95%
E/V: 80.6%
D/V: 19.4%

Calculated WACC: 6.1%
Adjusted WACC (company-specific premium): 7.5%
```

Low WACC reflects GL's low beta (0.46) - market sees it as defensive despite short-seller noise.

## 7 Gates Status

| Gate | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1. Business understanding | PASS | Complete with unit economics |
| 2. Projection fundamentada | PASS | WACC derived, not default |
| 3. Multi-method valuation | PASS | P/B + P/E |
| 4. MoS threshold | **FAIL** | 17.6% < 25% required |
| 5. Macro context | PASS | Favorable (rates, no tariffs) |
| 6. Portfolio fit | PASS | Low correlation |
| 7. Autocritica | PASS | Documented |

**Gate 4 failure prevents ADD recommendation.**

---

## Action Items

1. **HOLD** existing position (~$500 at $141)
2. **DO NOT ADD** at current $143.44
3. **SET ALERT** at $130 (MoS would reach 25.3%)
4. **MONITOR** Q4 2025 earnings on Feb 5, 2026
5. **UPDATE** after earnings if material change

---

## Upcoming Catalyst

**Q4 2025 Earnings: February 5, 2026 (after market close)**
- Consensus EPS: $3.44 (vs $3.14 YoY = +9.6%)
- FY2025 consensus: $14.58 (vs $12.37 YoY = +17.9%)
- FY2026 consensus: $15.04

If earnings beat, may need to re-evaluate FV upward.
If earnings miss, hold position but watch for breakdown.

---

## Lessons Learned from v2.0 Application

1. **DCF alone overestimates for insurers** - P/B vs ROE is more appropriate
2. **Framework forces conservatism** - Good discipline
3. **Value trap checklist is powerful** - Clear 0/10 score gives confidence
4. **WACC derivation revealed low beta** - Confirms defensive nature
5. **Quality Score improved to 7/10** - Better than initially assessed

---

## Conclusion

GL remains a quality position but the Framework v2.0 methodology reveals the original valuation was too aggressive. At current prices ($143.44), MoS of 17.6% is below the 25% Tier B threshold.

**Recommendation: HOLD position, wait for pullback to $130 or better before adding.**

The thesis fundamentals are strong (0/10 value trap, favorable macro, quality business), but price has outpaced conservative Fair Value.
