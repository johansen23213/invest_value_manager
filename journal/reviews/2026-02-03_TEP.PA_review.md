## v2.0 FRAMEWORK CHANGES APPLIED

1. **Business Analysis Framework**: Completed unit economics, margin structure, capital requirements
2. **Why Is It Cheap?**: Documented AI disruption narrative + contra-thesis
3. **Value Trap Checklist**: PASSED (1 SI, 2 MAYBE out of 10 factors)
4. **Projection Framework**: Derived growth from TAM/share/pricing (not default 5%)
5. **WACC Derivation**: Calculated 5.05%, adjusted to 10% for AI risk
6. **Multi-Method Valuation**: DCF (50%) + EV/EBIT (50%)
7. **Scenarios**: Bear/Base/Bull with probability weighting

## KEY FINDING: DCF vs EV/EBIT DIVERGENCE

| Method | Bear | Base | Bull |
|--------|------|------|------|
| DCF (WACC 10%) | EUR 208 | EUR 272 | EUR 358 |
| EV/EBIT | EUR 35 | EUR 66 | EUR 107 |
| **Divergence** | 5.9x | 4.1x | 3.3x |

**Analysis:** DCF assumes FCF continues at EUR 1B+ and grows. EV/EBIT reflects market's structural concern about AI disruption. The market is pricing closer to EV/EBIT 6-7x (between bear and base), which is more realistic for a business facing AI headwinds.

**Resolution:** Weight EV/EBIT more heavily (75%) than DCF (25%) given AI uncertainty.

---

## POSITION SIZE CONSTRAINT VIOLATION

- **Current allocation:** 8.1% (USD 925)
- **Max allowed:** 7.0%
- **Excess:** 1.1pp

**Root cause:** Added 7 shares on 2026-02-03 without checking constraint_checker.py

**Action Required:** TRIM 2 shares to bring position to ~6.5%

---

## RECOMMENDATION

| Action | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **TRIM** | Sell 2 shares (~EUR 112) |
| **HOLD** | Remaining 12 shares |
| **MONITOR** | Kill conditions: FCF <EUR 600M, revenue decline >5%, major client AI announcement, dividend cut |

**Rationale:**
- Fair Value EUR 110 provides 49% MoS -- adequate for Tier B (25% threshold)
- Even Bear case (EUR 78) provides 28% upside
- AI disruption is REAL risk but already priced at 6.5x EV/EBIT
- Dividend 7.5% provides income while waiting

---

## AUTOCRITICA

**What v2.0 revealed that original analysis missed:**
1. EV/EBIT valuation is more appropriate than DCF for AI-disrupted business
2. Original DCF (EUR 115 weighted FV) was slightly optimistic
3. Position sizing needs pre-validation with constraint_checker.py

**Lesson for future:**
- ALWAYS run constraint_checker.py BEFORE recommending ADD
- For businesses facing structural disruption, anchor valuation to EV/EBIT not DCF
