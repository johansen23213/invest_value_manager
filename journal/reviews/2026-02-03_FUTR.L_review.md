## Value Trap Checklist (10 Factors)

| # | Factor | v2.0 Status |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Industria en declive secular | **SI** |
| 2 | Disrupcion tecnologica | **SI** |
| 3 | Management destruyendo valor | NO |
| 4 | Balance deteriorandose | NO |
| 5 | Insider selling >5% | NO |
| 6 | Dividend cut reciente/probable | NO |
| 7 | Perdida market share >2pp | NO |
| 8 | ROIC < WACC 3 anos | **SI** |
| 9 | FCF negativo >2 anos | NO |
| 10 | Goodwill >50% equity | **SI** |

**Result: 4/10 = ELEVATED RISK** (threshold for caution is >3)

## WACC Derivation

```
Rf (UK 10Y Gilt) = 4.5%
Beta = 1.37
ERP = 5.5%
Ke = 4.5% + 1.37 x 5.5% = 12.0%

Kd after-tax = 5.5% x 0.75 = 4.1%
E/V = 65%, D/V = 35%

WACC = (65% x 12%) + (35% x 4.1%) = 9.2%
+ Small-cap premium: +1.5%
= 10.7% --> rounded to 11%
```

## Multi-Method Valuation

| Method | FV | Weight |
|--------|-----|--------|
| DCF (adjusted) | 1,150 GBp | 50% |
| EV/EBIT (8x) | 1,436 GBp | 50% |
| **Weighted** | **1,293 GBp** | |
| **Conservative** | **1,000-1,150 GBp** | (lower end due to value trap risk) |

Divergence: 25% (within 30% tolerance)

## Key Findings

### Positives
1. MoS still exceeds Tier C requirement (46-53% vs 35%)
2. FCF generation remains strong (177M GBP, 34% yield)
3. Management discipline: buybacks 19% of market cap, 5x dividend increase
4. Operating margin maintained at 28% despite revenue decline

### Negatives
1. **4 value trap factors = elevated risk**
2. ROIC ~8% < WACC ~11% = value destruction on invested capital
3. Industry under structural pressure from AI
4. No clear informational edge - market may be right

---

## Action

**STATUS: HOLD**

**Rationale:**
- Position entered at good price, MoS still adequate
- Would NOT initiate NEW position without turnaround evidence
- ADD only if price falls to <450 GBp (MoS >60%)

**Kill Conditions:**
1. Revenue decline >10% YoY for 2 consecutive quarters
2. Operating margin <22%
3. Dividend cut
4. Management stops buybacks
5. Goodwill impairment >30% equity

**Next Review:** H1 FY2026 results (May 2026)
