## Key Changes in v2.0

### 1. WACC Derivation (Major Impact)
- v1.0 assumed 9% WACC (default)
- v2.0 derived: Rf 4.5% + Beta 0.44 x ERP 5.0% = Ke 6.7%, Kd after-tax 3.75%
- Base WACC: 5.65% + 175bp risk premium = **7.4%**
- Lower WACC = Higher Fair Value

### 2. Value Trap Checklist (New in v2.0)
- 10 factors evaluated
- Result: 2 PARTIAL (elevated leverage, goodwill post-acquisition)
- **PASSED** - Not a value trap

### 3. Multi-Method Valuation (New in v2.0)
- v1.0: DCF only
- v2.0: DCF (50%) + EV/EBIT Comparables (50%)
- Both methods converge at ~550 GBp (high confidence)

### 4. Quality Score Upgrade
- v1.0: 4.5/10 (Debt/Equity = 0)
- v2.0: 5.0/10 (Debt/Equity = 0.5 due to deleveraging progress)
- Tier upgrade: C to B (lower MoS requirement)

## Conclusion

The v2.0 re-evaluation **CONFIRMS** the TATE.L position. The thesis is now stronger because:

1. Proper WACC derivation shows the stock is more undervalued than initially thought
2. Value trap checklist confirms this is NOT a value trap
3. Multi-method valuation provides triangulation
4. MoS now exceeds Tier B requirement

**Action: HOLD** - No changes to position required.
