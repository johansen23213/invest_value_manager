## Key Findings

### 1. WACC Properly Derived
- Used 10Y Treasury (4.25%), Beta (1.269), ERP (5%)
- Cost of Equity: 10.59%
- Cost of Debt after-tax: 2.69%
- Weighted WACC: **8.34%** (vs ~9.8% assumed previously)

### 2. Multi-Method Valuation Shows Divergence
- DCF Base: $313.58 (55% upside)
- EV/EBITDA Base: $253.89 (20.5% upside)
- **Methods diverge 23%** - significant uncertainty

### 3. Value Trap Checklist
- Score: 1-1.5 factors (PARTIAL on ROIC, borderline on Goodwill)
- **NOT a value trap** but also **NOT a quality compounder**
- ROIC (~10%) barely exceeds WACC (8.34%) = 166bp spread only

### 4. Behavioral Health TAM
- US behavioral health market: $95B (2025) growing at 5-6% CAGR
- UHS is largest private operator (8-10% share)
- Secular tailwind supports thesis but not exceptional growth

| Gate | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1. Business Understanding | PASS | Unit economics, model, "why cheap" documented |
| 2. Projection Framework | PASS | WACC derived, growth from TAM analysis |
| 3. Multi-Method Valuation | PASS | DCF 50% + EV/EBITDA 50% |
| 4. Margin of Safety | MARGINAL | 28.8% vs 25% required |
| 5. Macro Context | PASS | Neutral, no adverse factors |
| 6. Portfolio Fit | PASS | Within constraints |
| 7. Autocritica | PASS | Biases and counter-arguments documented |

## Action Recommendation

**STATUS: HOLD (downgraded from BUY)**

**Rationale:**
1. MoS of 28.8% exceeds Tier B threshold (25%) but is not compelling
2. EV/EBITDA method shows only 20% upside - more conservative method
3. ROIC barely exceeds WACC - not a quality compounder
4. Prefer to HOLD existing position but NOT ADD at current levels

**Triggers:**
- **ADD at $180 or below** (30%+ MoS on blended)
- **SELL if ROIC < WACC for 2 consecutive quarters**
- **PARTIAL SELL at $260-280** (approaching fair value)

## Lessons Learned (Framework v2.0 vs v1)

1. **Derived WACC matters:** Using Beta (1.269) + Rf (4.25%) + ERP (5%) = 8.34% WACC is LOWER than the ~9.8% default, which actually REDUCES fair value in DCF (lower discount = higher present value of cash flows, but also higher terminal value sensitivity). However, the multi-method approach with EV/EBITDA provides a more conservative anchor.

2. **Methods diverging is a warning sign:** DCF and EV/EBITDA diverge by 23%. This suggests high sensitivity to inputs and reduced confidence in any single fair value estimate.

3. **ROIC-WACC spread is critical:** A 166bp spread means UHS creates minimal economic value above its cost of capital. This is a "fair" business, not a "great" business.
