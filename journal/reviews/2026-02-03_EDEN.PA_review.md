## Framework v2.0 Compliance

### Business Analysis Framework
- [x] Business model clearly understood (B2B benefits platform)
- [x] Unit economics documented (LTV/CAC >5x estimated)
- [x] Margin structure analyzed (42% GM, 30% OM, 41% EBITDA)
- [x] "Why cheap" clearly explained (regulatory + growth slowdown + re-rating)
- [x] Value trap checklist completed (0-1 factors = NOT a trap)

### Projection Framework
- [x] Growth rates derived from TAM/share/pricing (not defaults)
- [x] WACC calculated properly (Rf 3.44% + Beta 1.0 x ERP 5% = 8.5%)
- [x] Terminal growth justified (2.5%, GDP + pricing)
- [x] Bear/Base/Bull scenarios defined

### Valuation Methods
- [x] Minimum 2 methods used (DCF + EV/EBIT)
- [x] Methods appropriate for company type (Payment/HR Tech)
- [x] Divergence explained (50% gap due to growth capture in DCF)

## Key Changes from Original Thesis

1. **WACC Derivation**: Changed from 9% default to 8.5% derived (Rf + Beta x ERP)
   - Note: Beta from yfinance (0.37) was rejected as anomalously low, adjusted to 1.0

2. **Second Valuation Method**: Added EV/EBIT normalized (EUR 41.2)
   - Anchors the valuation and prevents DCF optimism

3. **Blended Fair Value**: New metric EUR 51.5 (50% DCF + 50% EV/EBIT)
   - More robust than single-method

4. **Explicit Kill Conditions**: Documented 5 specific triggers for immediate sale

5. **Sell Targets**: Defined 80%/100%/Bull FV triggers per investment-rules

## Decision

### Status: **MANTENER**

Thesis original VALIDADA por Framework v2.0. El MoS de 46.8% es casi el doble del minimo requerido (25%) para Tier B. No hay deterioro fundamental. Earnings el 24 Feb son el proximo catalizador clave.

### Actions Required

1. **Monitor earnings 24 Feb 2026**: Key confirmation/invalidation point
2. **No action needed now**: Position sizing appropriate (assumed ~4%)
3. **Set alerts**:
   - ADD trigger: post-earnings confirmation + price < EUR 20
   - TRIM trigger: price > EUR 41 (80% FV Base)

## Escalation

- [x] No escalation needed - thesis validated, HOLD position
- [ ] Escalate to investment-committee (only if status changes)
