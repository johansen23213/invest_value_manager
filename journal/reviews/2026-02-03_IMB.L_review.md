## Key Findings

### 1. Value Trap Analysis (NEW in v2.0)
Completed the 10-factor value trap checklist:
- **Only 1 factor present**: Secular industry decline (cigarette volumes -2-4%/year)
- **Mitigating factor**: Pricing power (+5-6%/year) more than offsets volume decline
- **FY25 evidence**: Revenue +3.7%, Adj Operating Profit +4.6% despite volume decline
- **Verdict**: NOT a value trap. Qualifies for Tier A (15% MoS requirement).

### 2. WACC Derivation (NEW in v2.0)
Previous thesis implied WACC but did not derive it:
- Beta: 0.139 (yfinance) - extremely low, typical of defensive tobacco
- Theoretical WACC: 4.7% (CAPM formula)
- **Conservative WACC used**: 7.5% (buffer for model risk)
- **DDM Required Return**: 9% (investor perspective)

### 3. Multi-Method Valuation (v2.0 requirement)
| Method | Fair Value | Weight | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| DDM (Gordon Growth) | 3,723p | 60% | Primary for dividend income stocks |
| DCF (Bear case) | 3,821p | 20% | FCF-based, conservative scenario |
| FCF Yield (9%) | 3,515p | 20% | Cross-check |
| **Blended** | **3,701p** | 100% | |

### 4. Business Understanding Deepened
- Unit economics: Unique "infinite LTV/CAC" due to addiction
- Pricing power: 10% price increase loses only 3-5% volume
- FCF conversion: >80%, extremely stable
- Capital requirements: Asset-light (<2% revenue capex)

## Recommendation

**HOLD - Thesis Confirmed**

The position passes all 7 Investment Committee gates under Framework v2.0:
1. Business understanding complete
2. Projection derived (not defaults)
3. Multi-method valuation (DDM + DCF + FCF Yield)
4. MoS 20% > 15% required for Tier A
5. Macro context favorable (defensive in uncertain environment)
6. Portfolio fit (5% position, within constraints)
7. Autocritica documented
