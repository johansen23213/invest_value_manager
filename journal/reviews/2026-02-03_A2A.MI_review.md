## Key Findings

### 1. Fair Value Revision
The original thesis used DCF with projected positive FCF, but A2A currently has NEGATIVE FCF due to its EUR 23B capex cycle (2024-2035). This makes DCF unreliable.

v2.0 uses DDM (appropriate for dividend income utility) and EV/EBIT (appropriate for earnings-based valuation), which are more suitable given the company's profile.

### 2. WACC Derivation
- Original: 7.5% (conservative assumption)
- v2.0: 6.5% (derived: Rf 3.5% + Beta 0.94 x ERP 5.0% = 8.2% Ke, weighted with Kd)

The derived WACC is lower but more accurate. However, the change in valuation method (DCF to DDM/EV/EBIT) had a larger impact than the WACC change.

### 3. Thesis Validity
The investment thesis remains VALID:
- Regulated concessions (moat) intact
- NFP/EBITDA improved (2.5x to 2.3x)
- Dividend policy (4% growth) maintained
- Macro context (BCE stable rates) favorable
- No value trap indicators

### 4. Margin of Safety Issue
At EUR 2.53, the stock offers only 6.3% MoS vs fair value of EUR 2.70. This is insufficient for:
- Tier A: requires 15% MoS
- Tier B: requires 25% MoS

However, since the position is already held (not a new purchase), the appropriate action is HOLD, not SELL.

## Action Recommendation

| Action | Recommendation | Rationale |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| Current position | HOLD | Thesis valid, no sell triggers |
| Add to position | NO | MoS insufficient (6.3% < 15%) |
| Price trigger for ADD | EUR 2.30 | Would provide 15% MoS |
| Price trigger for SELL | N/A | No triggers hit; maintain while dividend grows |

---

## Risk Monitor

| Risk | Status | Trigger Level | Current |
|------|--------|---------------|---------|
| Net Debt/EBITDA | OK | >3.5x | 2.3x |
| Dividend | OK | Cut | No cut, 4% growth policy |
| Concession loss | OK | Milan/Brescia | None |
| EBITDA | OK | <EUR 1.8B | ~EUR 2.4B guidance |

## Conclusion

The Framework v2.0 re-evaluation revealed that A2A.MI was somewhat overvalued in the original thesis (FV EUR 3.62 vs new FV EUR 2.70). The key difference is using appropriate valuation methods for a utility in a capex cycle.

The position remains a HOLD with a quality dividend (4% yield, 4% growth, 38% payout ratio) and valid thesis. Monitor for ADD opportunity if price drops to EUR 2.30.
