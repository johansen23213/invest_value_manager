# Risk Assessment: NVO (Novo Nordisk A/S)

## Fecha: 2026-02-09

## Risk Score: VERY HIGH

---

## Executive Summary

This adversarial risk assessment identifies **14 material risks**, of which **4 are CRITICAL** and **5 are HIGH**. The thesis (dated 2026-02-04) contains several significant factual errors, omissions, and optimistic assumptions that inflate the fair value and understate risk. Most critically:

1. **The thesis COMPLETELY MISSES the CEO departure, board shakeup, and 9,000 layoffs** -- the most significant corporate governance event in Novo's recent history
2. **The thesis claims FCF margin >25%** when actual 2025 FCF margin is 9.2% (DKK 28.3B / DKK 309B) -- a 63% overstatement
3. **The thesis claims QS 82 (Tier A)** when the quantitative tool calculates QS 73 (Tier B) -- the difference is material for portfolio strategy
4. **CagriSema REDEFINE 4 head-to-head data is NOT yet released** as of Feb 9, 2026 -- the thesis assumed March 2026 but this is still pending, creating binary event risk
5. **Product liability litigation exceeding $2B** is not mentioned in the thesis risk section

## Quality Score Reassessment

### Thesis Claims vs Tool Output vs My Assessment

| Component | Thesis (Manual) | Tool (Automated) | My Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| Financial Quality | 36/40 | 28/40 | **28/40** | Tool is correct -- FCF margin is 9.2%, NOT >25% |
| Growth Quality | 20/25 | 18/25 | **16/25** | GM declining AND revenue declining in 2026; thesis gave 0/5 for GM but 10/10 for revenue CAGR which is backward-looking |
| Moat Evidence | 19/25 | 22/25 | **19/25** | Lost market leadership; share declining from 55% to ~39% |
| Capital Allocation | 7/10 | 5/10 | **5/10** | 0% insider ownership confirmed; no insider buying despite 50%+ drop |
| **TOTAL** | **82/100 Tier A** | **73/100 Tier B** | **68/100 Tier B** | **Thesis overrated by 14 points** |

### FCF Margin Discrepancy: CRITICAL FINDING

The thesis states: "FCF Margin >25%" and "FCF: DKK 87B (FCF margin 28%)"

**Actual 2025 data from annual report:**
- Revenue: DKK 309.1B
- Operating Cash Flow: ~DKK 118B (estimated from 9M: DKK 63.9B + Q4)
- CapEx (PP&E): DKK 60.1B
- CapEx (Intangibles/Akero acquisition): DKK 30.0B
- **Total CapEx: DKK 90.1B**
- **Reported FCF: DKK 28.3B**
- **FCF Margin: 9.2%**

The thesis appears to have used a "normalized" FCF that excludes the massive capex cycle and the Akero acquisition. While capex WILL normalize eventually, for 2026:
- Guided capex: ~DKK 55-60B (still elevated)
- Revenue declining 5-13%
- **Expected FCF margin: 8-15% at best, NOT 25-28%**

The thesis's DKK 87B "2025E FCF" was never real. Even excluding the DKK 30B Akero intangible capex, FCF was only ~DKK 58B, implying a margin of ~19%. Stripping ALL acquisitions and using only maintenance capex (~DKK 20B), you might get "normalized" FCF of ~DKK 98B (32% margin), but this is theoretical. The company IS spending DKK 60B/year on capacity expansion. This is not optional -- it is required to compete with Lilly.

**Verdict: The tool's 9.4% FCF margin is essentially correct for current reported FCF. The thesis's >25% is aspirational, not factual.**

### Why QS 68 and Not 73 or 82

I adjust the tool's 73 downward by 5 points because:
1. **Revenue CAGR 15% is backward-looking**: 2026 guidance is -5% to -13%. Forward growth is negative. Awarding 8/10 for historical growth when growth is now NEGATIVE is misleading. I give 5/10.
2. **GM declining is worse than tool captures**: From 84.7% to 81.0% in one year, with further compression expected. This is 0/5, which both thesis and tool got right.
3. **Market position deteriorating**: Share loss from ~55% to ~39% is ongoing, not stabilized.

**Conclusion: NVO is Tier B (Quality Value), NOT Tier A (Quality Compounder). The thesis's Tier A classification is wrong.**

## Top 3 Riesgos Criticos

### 1. Management Turmoil: CEO Departure + Board Shakeup + 9,000 Layoffs

- **Categoria:** Fundamental / Governance
- **Descripcion:** The thesis (dated Feb 4, 2026) states "Management destroying value: NO" and lists no management risk. In reality, as of this assessment:
  - CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen was FORCED OUT after 8 years (stock fell 65%+ from peak under his watch)
  - North America head Doug Langa DEPARTED end of Dec 2025
  - Commercial strategy head Camilla Sylvest DEPARTING April 2026 (after 28 years)
  - Global obesity SVP Frederik Kier LEFT to join competitor Leo
  - Board chairman Helge Lund RESIGNED in Oct 2025
  - Novo Foundation REPLACED 6 board members -- effectively a board takeover
  - New CEO Maziar Mike Doustdar appointed July 2025 -- company insider but only 1 month into role when thesis was written
  - 9,000 employees (11.5% of workforce) being laid off to save DKK 8B ($1.3B) annually
- **Evidencia:** FiercePharma, BioSpace, CBS News, Fortune all confirmed these events. The thesis mentions NONE of this.
- **Probabilidad:** Certain -- these events already occurred
- **Impacto si materializa:** Already materializing. Restructuring creates execution risk during the most competitive period in Novo's history. Loss of institutional knowledge from 9,000 layoffs + departing executives. New CEO must execute turnaround while fighting Lilly, managing price cuts, and launching CagriSema simultaneously. Estimated impact: 15-25% risk premium on valuation.
- **Mitigante:** Doustdar is a Novo insider (knows the company). Cost savings of $1.3B/year are real and material. Board reset could bring fresh perspective.
- **Kill condition?:** NO -- but should be a monitoring condition. If Doustdar departs or another wave of executive exits occurs, that IS a kill condition.

### 2. Pricing Collapse: MFN Deal + Rebate Pressure = Structural Revenue Impairment

- **Categoria:** Fundamental / Regulatorio
- **Descripcion:** The thesis mentions "US price pressure" as a medium-probability risk. In reality, the price cut is AGREED and CERTAIN:
  - Ozempic: $1,000/month to $350 (TrumpRx) -- **65% price cut**
  - Wegovy: $1,350/month to $350 (TrumpRx) -- **74% price cut**
  - Medicare/Medicaid: $245/month
  - Oral Wegovy: $149-$299/month (launched at value pricing from day 1)
  - These are NOT threats -- they are AGREED commitments
  - In exchange: 3-year tariff exemption and $10B US manufacturing investment
  - Gross margin already fell from 84.7% to 81.0% in 2025
  - The new CEO explicitly said: "Price reduction is our investment for the future"
- **Evidencia:** White House fact sheet, AJMC, CNBC, Pharmacy Times all confirmed the MFN deal details.
- **Probabilidad:** Certain -- deal is signed
- **Impacto si materializa:** Revenue per patient drops 65-74%. To maintain revenue, Novo needs 3-4x MORE patients. Global obesity penetration is <5%, so volume upside exists, but the math is brutal:
  - 2025 US GLP-1 revenue: ~$18B (estimated)
  - At 65% average price cut: revenue per patient ~$350/month vs $800+
  - Need ~2.3x current patient volume just to stay flat
  - Guidance of -5% to -13% revenue decline INCLUDES this impact
  - Gross margin likely headed to 70-75% range by 2027
  - Estimated impact on fair value: -20% to -30% vs thesis assumptions
- **Mitigante:** Volume growth in obesity is real (50k Wegovy pill prescriptions/week in 3 weeks). TAM is growing. But the timing mismatch (price cuts NOW, volume ramp OVER YEARS) creates a revenue valley.
- **Kill condition?:** YES -- if gross margin falls below 70%, add as kill condition. The thesis has this at GM <70% already, which is correct. But the thesis does not acknowledge how CLOSE we are (81% now, heading to 75-77%).

### 3. CagriSema REDEFINE 4 Binary Event Risk

- **Categoria:** Fundamental / Valoracion
- **Descripcion:** The CagriSema vs Zepbound (tirzepatide) head-to-head trial (REDEFINE 4) is an 84-week, 800-patient Phase 3 trial. As of Feb 9, 2026, results have NOT been released. The thesis lists this as a catalyst with "Medium" probability of positive outcome. This is THE binary event that determines whether Novo has a competitive next-gen product or not.
- **Evidencia:** Clinical trial databases, Novo Nordisk press releases, NEJM publication of REDEFINE 1 (22.7% weight loss). REDEFINE 4 results still pending.
- **Probabilidad:** 50/50 for positive outcome (genuine uncertainty)
- **Impacto si materializa:**

#### Scenario Analysis: CagriSema Head-to-Head

**PRE-DATA (Current State -- Maximum Uncertainty)**
- Market is pricing in ambiguity. CagriSema achieved 22.7% in REDEFINE 1 (no direct comparator).
- Zepbound achieved ~25.3% in SURMOUNT-1 (different trial, not head-to-head).
- Cross-trial comparison suggests CagriSema MAY be slightly inferior, but cross-trial comparisons are unreliable.
- Current price reflects ~50% probability of acceptable outcome.
- Risk: Stock remains in limbo until data releases. Dead money risk while waiting.

**POST-DATA: POSITIVE Scenario (Non-inferiority or Superiority)**
- CagriSema shows >=24% weight loss, within 1-2pp of Zepbound
- Impact: Stock re-rates +20-30%. P/E expands from 13x to 16-18x.
- Narrative changes from "losing to Lilly" to "competitive duopoly restored"
- CagriSema FDA approval accelerates (H2 2026)
- Risk profile drops from VERY HIGH to HIGH
- Fair value: DKK 400-450 (post-data)
- Probability: 35%

**POST-DATA: NEGATIVE Scenario (Clear Inferiority)**
- CagriSema shows <21% weight loss OR >4pp inferior to Zepbound
- Impact: Stock drops -15-25%. P/E compresses to 10-12x.
- Narrative cements "permanently #2 with inferior product"
- Market share loss accelerates to below 35%
- Pipeline narrative collapses -- what comes after semaglutide?
- Fair value: DKK 200-250 (post-data)
- Probability: 30%

**POST-DATA: AMBIGUOUS Scenario (Mixed Results)**
- CagriSema shows 22-23% weight loss, marginally inferior but not clearly so
- Impact: Stock moves +/-5%. Status quo maintained.
- Narrative: "Good enough" but not differentiated
- CagriSema still gets approved but without strong marketing story
- Fair value: DKK 320-380 (modest re-rating)
- Probability: 35%

- **Mitigante:** Even if CagriSema disappoints, Novo has oral Wegovy (first-mover), amycretin in pipeline, and massive installed base. But the psychological and narrative impact would be severe.
- **Kill condition?:** YES -- this IS already a kill condition in the thesis. "CagriSema head-to-head shows inferiority to Zepbound" = SELL.

## Riesgos NO Mencionados en Thesis

| Riesgo | Severidad | Mencionado en thesis? | Comentario |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|------------|
| CEO forced out + board takeover + 9,000 layoffs | **CRITICAL** | **NO** | The single biggest governance event in Novo's recent history is COMPLETELY absent from the thesis |
| MFN pricing deal specifics (65-74% price cuts AGREED) | **HIGH** | Minimized ("US price pressure 50% probability") | The price cuts are CERTAIN, not 50% probability. The magnitude (65-74%) is not mentioned |
| Product liability MDL with 3,063 lawsuits and $2B+ estimated liability | **HIGH** | **NO** | Not mentioned at all in risk assessment |
| Akero Therapeutics acquisition ($30B DKK intangibles in 2025) | **MEDIUM** | **NO** | Massive capital deployment on NASH drug with uncertain return |
| Securities class action lawsuit over CagriSema guidance | **MEDIUM** | **NO** | Active federal litigation |
| GLP-1 market fragmentation (Amgen 2027, Pfizer 2028, Roche 2029, Viking 2028) | **HIGH** | Mentioned as "Duopoly will persist" | Thesis DISMISSES 4+ new entrants as irrelevant; duopoly assumption may break by 2028-2029 |
| Compounded GLP-1s: 1.5M Americans already using generics | **MEDIUM** | Mentioned but minimized ("quality concerns limit") | FDA crackdown helps but Hims pulled Wegovy pill knockoff only after legal threat |
| FCF margin reality: 9.2% not >25% | **CRITICAL** | **NO -- thesis states opposite** | Thesis states FCF margin >25% and uses DKK 87B FCF; actual is DKK 28.3B |
| CapEx cycle: DKK 90B in 2025 (29% of revenue!) | **HIGH** | **NO** | Thesis ignores that Novo is in a MASSIVE investment cycle |

## DCF Tool Output Analysis

The DCF tool produced the following (using NVO ADR in USD):

| Scenario | FV/Share | MoS% vs Current $47.64 |
|----------|----------|------------------------|
| Bear | $89.26 | +87.4% |
| Base | $120.21 | +152.3% |
| Bull | $164.06 | +244.4% |

**WARNING: These figures appear to use DEFAULT growth assumptions that may not reflect NVO's actual situation.** The tool's defaults (5% growth, 9% WACC, 2.5% terminal) are likely too generic for a pharma company with:
- Revenue DECLINING 5-13% in 2026
- Massive capex cycle consuming FCF
- Net debt of $104B (includes Catalent debt)

The $104B net debt figure from yfinance likely includes ALL debt and is being subtracted from EV. This significantly reduces equity value. The DCF outputs should be viewed with extreme caution.

**My independent assessment using thesis's own DCF methodology but corrected inputs:**

Using actual FCF data:
- 2025 FCF: DKK 28.3B (actual, includes capex cycle)
- Normalized FCF (excluding Akero): DKK 58B
- True "maintenance" FCF (if capex normalizes to DKK 30B): DKK 88B

The thesis used DKK 87B (close to normalized) for its DCF, which is legitimate IF capex normalizes. But capex will NOT normalize in 2026 (guided DKK 55-60B). It may normalize by 2028. Using mid-cycle normalized FCF of DKK 75B (conservative):

| Scenario | Growth | WACC | Terminal | FV/share DKK |
|----------|--------|------|----------|-------------|
| Bear | -5% yr1, 0% yr2-5 | 8.5% | 2% | ~DKK 280 |
| Base | -5% yr1, +5% CAGR yr2-5 | 7.5% | 2.5% | ~DKK 420 |
| Bull | -5% yr1, +10% CAGR yr2-5 | 7% | 2.5% | ~DKK 560 |

This gives a LOWER range than the thesis's DKK 491 weighted FV. My weighted FV: ~DKK 370 (applying 30/45/25 bear/base/bull weights given elevated uncertainty).

**Thesis FV DKK 491 vs My Risk-Adjusted FV DKK 370 = -25% delta.**

At current price DKK 307 (via NVO ADR ~$47.64):
- MoS vs my FV: (370-307)/370 = **17%** (not the thesis's 38%)
- MoS vs bear case: (307-280)/307 = **-9%** downside only cushion (tight)

---

## Kill Conditions Sugeridas

Based on my findings, the thesis kill conditions should be EXPANDED:

### Existing Kill Conditions (from thesis -- validated)
1. CagriSema head-to-head shows inferiority to Zepbound -- **VALID, keep**
2. Market share falls below 40% -- **ALREADY BREACHED (~39% currently)** -- needs immediate attention
3. Gross margin falls below 70% -- **VALID, keep, but at 81% declining rapidly**
4. Dividend cut -- **VALID, keep**
5. ROIC falls below WACC for 2+ years -- **VALID, keep**

### NEW Kill Conditions to Add
6. **New CEO Doustdar departs within 12 months** -- would signal intractable problems
7. **Product liability settlement exceeds $5B** -- would impair balance sheet
8. **GLP-1 market share falls below 35%** -- below which Novo loses negotiating leverage with payers
9. **2027 revenue also declines** -- would falsify the "2026 is trough" thesis entirely
10. **Oral Wegovy weekly prescriptions plateau below 100k/week** -- would signal the pill is not the growth driver hoped for

### URGENT: Kill Condition #2 May Already Be Breached
The thesis states "Market share falls below 40%" as a kill condition. Multiple sources indicate Novo's GLP-1 share is now ~39%. This needs immediate resolution by the orchestrator:
- Is 39% "below 40%"? Strictly yes.
- Is the trend still declining? Yes.
- Should this trigger a SELL? The thesis says so.
- Counter-argument: Share loss may stabilize as oral Wegovy gains traction and CagriSema launches.
- **Recommendation: Flag for Investment Committee review. Do NOT auto-sell, but this kill condition is flashing amber.**

---

## Riesgo Agregado

- Numero de riesgos HIGH+CRITICAL: **9** (4 CRITICAL + 5 HIGH)
- Riesgos correlacionados: **YES**
  - Risks 1, 2, 4, 6 are ALL correlated: Management turmoil + market share loss + revenue decline + pricing collapse are all manifestations of the SAME underlying problem: Novo is losing its dominant competitive position
  - If CagriSema data is negative (Risk 3), it amplifies ALL of the above
  - The litigation risk (Risk 7) is correlated with pricing (if volume expands to offset price cuts, more patients = more potential lawsuits)

- **Risk Score Final: VERY HIGH**

Justification: 4 CRITICAL risks, including 2 that are CERTAIN (already occurred). The thesis misses the most important governance event in Novo's recent history. The FCF margin claim is factually wrong. The QS is overstated by 9-14 points. Multiple kill conditions are being tested. The correlated nature of risks means a negative CagriSema outcome would trigger a cascade.

## CagriSema Scenario Deep Dive

### Current Position (Pre-Data)

| Factor | Status | Thesis Assumption | Reality |
|--------|--------|-------------------|---------|
| REDEFINE 1 weight loss | 22.7% | "Solid" | Below 25% internal target; investors disappointed |
| REDEFINE 4 vs Zepbound | Pending | March 2026 data | NOT confirmed for March; could be later |
| FDA filing | Q1 2026 expected | H2 2026 approval | Filing accepted but REDEFINE 4 data may delay |
| Commercial positioning | "Next-gen product" | Superior to semaglutide alone | Only meaningful if competitive with tirzepatide |

### Cross-Trial Comparison (Unreliable but Informative)

| Drug | Trial | Weight Loss | Duration | Population |
|------|-------|-------------|----------|------------|
| CagriSema | REDEFINE 1 | 22.7% | 68 weeks | Obesity, no diabetes |
| Tirzepatide | SURMOUNT-1 | 25.3% (highest dose) | 72 weeks | Obesity, no diabetes |
| Semaglutide 2.4mg | STEP 1 | 14.9% | 68 weeks | Obesity, no diabetes |
| Oral semaglutide (pill) | OASIS 4 | 16.6% | 68 weeks | Obesity, no diabetes |

**Key Observation:** CagriSema (22.7%) slots BETWEEN injectable semaglutide (14.9%) and tirzepatide (25.3%). It is better than Novo's existing product but appears to trail Lilly's.

### What REDEFINE 4 Must Show

For CagriSema to be commercially viable, it needs to demonstrate ONE of:
1. **Non-inferiority to tirzepatide** (within 2-3pp) -- maintains "competitive" narrative
2. **Better side-effect profile** -- could differentiate even with lower efficacy
3. **Better outcomes in specific subpopulations** (e.g., diabetics, cardiovascular)

If it shows clear inferiority (>4pp gap), the narrative becomes: "Novo's best is worse than Lilly's best, and Lilly is also launching an oral pill."

### Portfolio Implications by Scenario

| Scenario | Probability | Stock Impact | Position Action |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Pre-data (NOW) | 100% | Maximum uncertainty priced in | HOLD small position (current ~4%) |
| Positive | 35% | +20-30% | ADD to 6-7% |
| Negative | 30% | -15-25% (to ~$36-40) | SELL -- kill condition triggered |
| Ambiguous | 35% | -5% to +5% | HOLD, reassess |

---

## Thesis Fair Value Challenge

| Component | Thesis Assumption | My Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| FCF 2025 | DKK 87B | DKK 28.3B actual (DKK 58B ex-Akero) | **-33% to -67% on DCF** |
| Revenue growth post-2026 | +5% CAGR | +3-5% CAGR (more competition, lower prices) | -10% on FV |
| P/E normalized | 20-22x | 15-18x (new normal with lower margins, more competition) | -15% on FV |
| QS | 82 Tier A | 68 Tier B | Changes required MoS from 15% to 25%+ |
| FV weighted | DKK 491 | DKK 370 (risk-adjusted) | **-25%** |
| MoS | 38% | 17% | Marginal, not "significant" |
| Bear case | DKK 240 | DKK 220-280 (depends on CagriSema) | Similar but with wider range |

### Analyst Consensus vs Thesis

| Source | Target (USD ADR) | Implied DKK | vs Thesis DKK 491 |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Consensus avg | $56-58 | ~DKK 420-440 | -10% to -15% |
| Consensus low | $42-46 | ~DKK 320-350 | -29% to -35% |
| Consensus high | $70-74 | ~DKK 530-560 | +8% to +14% |
| My risk-adjusted | ~$49 | ~DKK 370 | **-25%** |

The thesis is MORE optimistic than even the most bullish Wall Street analyst on some metrics.

---

## Positive Factors (Fairness Check -- Not All Doom)

To avoid pure confirmation bias against the thesis, here are genuine positives:

1. **Oral Wegovy is a real product with real traction**: 50k prescriptions/week in 3 weeks is exceptional
2. **TAM is enormous and underpenetrated**: <5% obesity penetration globally
3. **Manufacturing scale is a genuine moat**: 2-3 year lead time to build GLP-1 production
4. **Balance sheet is still strong**: Net debt manageable, investment grade credit
5. **Restructuring could work**: $1.3B/year savings is material
6. **P/E of 13x IS historically cheap** for a company with these margins
7. **DKK is EUR-pegged**: Minimal FX risk for our EUR-denominated portfolio
8. **Short interest declining**: Shorts are covering, not adding

---
## META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres
- **CagriSema REDEFINE 4 timing:** I could not confirm the exact data readout date. The thesis says March 2026. Multiple sources say "early 2026" but without specific date. This creates uncertainty about WHEN the binary event occurs.
- **FCF normalization timeline:** I am confident the current 9.2% FCF margin is depressed by the capex cycle, but I am uncertain exactly when it normalizes. If capex stays elevated through 2028 (as Novo invests $10B in US manufacturing per MFN deal), normalized FCF may not materialize until 2029.
- **Actual market share:** Sources cite "~39%" and "60%+ for Lilly" but these may refer to new prescriptions vs total prescriptions. The kill condition says "below 40%" -- need to clarify if 39% is on the same basis.
- **DCF tool output:** The $89-$164 range from dcf_calculator.py seems too high given the net debt figure. The tool may be double-counting or using default growth that does not match NVO's situation. I relied on my manual DCF instead.

### Riesgos que Podrian Estar Subestimados
- **New competition wave (2027-2029):** I classified this as HIGH but it could be CRITICAL. If Amgen's maritide or Viking's VK2735 show similar efficacy at lower cost, the GLP-1 duopoly breaks. Morningstar estimates new entrants could capture $70B of a $200B market by 2031 -- that means Novo and Lilly SHARE the remaining $130B, versus Novo's current assumption of ~$70B for itself.
- **Product liability:** $2B estimated liability could grow significantly. NAION (vision loss) claims are more severe than gastroparesis. If bellwether trials in late 2026 go against Novo, settlement costs could reach $5-10B.
- **Compounded semaglutide:** Hims dropped their Wegovy pill knockoff, but the underlying problem remains. 1.5M Americans already using compounded versions. FDA crackdown helps but enforcement is incomplete.

### Discrepancias con Thesis
1. **QS: 82 vs 68-73** -- thesis overrates by 9-14 points, changing tier classification
2. **FCF margin: >25% vs 9.2%** -- thesis is factually wrong on REPORTED FCF
3. **Management risk: "NO" vs CRITICAL** -- thesis completely ignores CEO departure, board shakeup, and 9,000 layoffs
4. **MFN pricing: "50% probability, Medium" vs Certain, High** -- thesis minimizes an agreed deal
5. **Market share: "49%" vs ~39%** -- thesis uses stale data; kill condition may already be breached
6. **MoS: "38% significant" vs "17% marginal"** -- my risk-adjusted FV is 25% lower than thesis
7. **Litigation: Not mentioned vs $2B+ potential liability** -- complete omission

### Sugerencias para el Sistema
1. **quality_scorer.py should flag when manual QS differs from automated QS by >5 points** -- the 82 vs 73 gap should have been caught
2. **Thesis templates should require DATED data for market share claims** -- the 49% figure was already stale when the thesis was written
3. **A management stability check should be part of the fundamental analysis framework** -- CEO changes, board shakeups, and mass layoffs are first-order risks that no thesis should miss
4. **FCF margin in thesis should always cite REPORTED FCF alongside normalized** -- stating ">25%" when reported is 9.2% is misleading even if the normalization logic is sound

### Preguntas para Orchestrator
1. **Kill condition #2 (market share <40%) appears breached at ~39%. How should we handle this? Strict enforcement (SELL) or reasoned exception (HOLD with monitoring)?**
2. **The thesis was written on Feb 4 but misses events from July-Oct 2025 (CEO departure, layoffs). Should the fundamental-analyst be instructed to ALWAYS check for management changes as Fase 1?**
3. **Given QS 68 (Tier B), the MoS requirement is higher than for Tier A. At MoS ~17% (vs my FV), does this position still meet minimum quality standards for the portfolio, especially given Principio 9 (quality gravitates upward)?**
4. **Should we reduce position size from $400 to reflect VERY HIGH risk score, or wait for CagriSema data?**
