# Counter-Analysis: IT (Gartner, Inc.)

## Fecha: 2026-02-13

## SCORING: 14/19 -- STRONG COUNTER

The thesis presents Gartner as a quality compounder unfairly punished by the market. While the business franchise is real (ROIC 52%, 84% client retention, #1 by 6x), the $245 fair value is materially overstated. Three critical findings undermine the thesis: (1) The thesis uses 2024 FCF of $1.4B for its OEY calculation, but FY2025 actual FCF was $1.2B -- a 13% decline -- and 2026 guided FCF is $1.135B, a further decline. This alone destroys the OEY-based FV of $306. (2) Revenue guidance for 2026 shows DECLINE (-0.6%), and the thesis projects 6% growth resuming in 2027 without adequate evidence -- management credibility is poor after multiple guidance cuts in 2025. (3) The 70% price decline is not merely "SaaSpocalypse sentiment" -- Net Contract Value turned negative ($-63M) in Q1 2025 for the first time since COVID, wallet retention fell below 100% on GTS (96%), and consulting collapsed -12.8%. The market is seeing real fundamental deterioration, not just panic. My independent FV estimate: **$160-185**, implying current price ($153) offers 4-21% upside at best, with severe bear case downside ($80-100).

## Asunciones Clave Desafiadas

### 1. Fair Value $245 (Weighted OEY + DCF)

- **Thesis claim:** FV $245, weighted 40% OEY ($306) + 60% DCF ($225), with 5% additional conservatism. MoS 37% at $150 entry.
- **Evidencia en contra:**
  - **CRITICAL: The OEY calculation uses stale FCF.** The thesis uses FCF of $1.4B (FY2024). But FY2025 actual FCF was **$1.2B** -- a 13.2% decline. And 2026 guided FCF is **$1.135B or more** -- a further 5.4% decline. Using correct FY2025 FCF:
    - Owner Earnings = $1.2B - $154M (maint capex) + $140M (D&A) = $1.186B
    - OEY = $1.186B / $11.6B market cap = **10.2%** (not 11.9%)
    - At thesis's 6% "fair OEY": FV = $1.186B / 0.06 = $19.77B / 75.5M shares = **$262** (not $306)
    - At more conservative 7% "fair OEY" (reflecting declining FCF trend): FV = $1.186B / 0.07 = **$224**
  - **The DCF uses 5% growth as "base case" despite management guiding -0.6% for 2026.** The DCF tool assumes 5% compounding from current levels. Year 1 FCF growth is actually NEGATIVE. A DCF that starts with -5% Y1 growth, then recovers to 4-5% in Y2-5, produces materially lower FVs:
    - My estimates: FCF Y1 = $1.08B (per guidance), recovery to $1.15B, $1.24B, $1.33B, $1.43B
    - At WACC 9.5% (higher than thesis's 8.8%, reflecting higher risk premium for declining revenue), terminal 2.5%:
    - FV approximately $190-210, not $225-316
  - **The weighting itself is questionable.** The thesis gives DCF 60% weight and OEY only 40%, arguing high sensitivity requires conservatism. But then uses the OEY FV ($306) for the "Tier A primary method" narrative. The weighted average of $257 was then "adjusted down 5%" to $245. This is arbitrary -- the 5% haircut for declining GM, consulting weakness, and CEO selling should be much larger given that ALL THREE are worsening, not stable.
  - **Bear case FV of $165 is too generous.** The risk assessment's probability-weighted bear is $80-100 (30% prob). The thesis's bear of $165 assumes 2% revenue growth and 16x P/E -- but if revenue actually DECLINES (which 2026 guidance shows), the bear should assume P/E compression to 12-14x (cyclical company treatment) with flat-to-declining EPS. That gives FV = $12 EPS x 13x = **$156** -- essentially current price.
  - **Peer comparison misleads.** The thesis notes P/E 15.9x vs historical 30-40x. But Gartner historically traded at 30-40x P/E when it was growing revenue 8-12% annually. At 2% growth (or decline), P/E 15-18x is APPROPRIATE for a low-growth information services company, not a discount.
- **Severidad:** **CRITICAL**
- **Resolucion sugerida:** Reduce FV to $160-185. Use FY2025 FCF ($1.2B) not FY2024 ($1.4B). Model Y1 FCF decline per guidance. Use WACC 9.5% minimum. Weight DCF 60% / conservative OEY 40%.

### 2. Revenue Growth Resumes to 6% by 2027

- **Thesis claim:** 2026 is a trough (2% FX-neutral growth), revenue accelerates to 6% in 2027+ as DOGE rolls off and buying cycles normalize.
- **Evidencia en contra:**
  - **2026 guidance is for revenue DECLINE, not 2% growth.** Revenue guidance of $6.455B is 0.6% BELOW FY2025's $6.5B. The thesis states "2% FX-neutral growth" but the actual dollar guidance is a DECLINE. FX-neutral growth of 2% is a currency-adjusted number that flatters the headline.
  - **Revenue growth trajectory is consistently DECELERATING**, not temporarily pausing: 9.8% CAGR -> 4% FY2025 -> DECLINE in 2026. This is a 3-year trend of deceleration, not a single bad quarter.
  - **Contract value growth of 1% is anemic.** CV is the leading indicator for future revenue. At 1% CV growth, it is mathematically impossible to achieve 6% revenue growth in 2027 unless CV dramatically accelerates. Management says they "expect CV growth to accelerate through 2026" but provided no quantitative target. Words without numbers are not evidence.
  - **Net Contract Value turned NEGATIVE ($-63M) in Q1 2025** for the first time since COVID. This means new bookings could not offset cancellations and downgrades. While Q2-Q4 improved, the Q1 negative was a structural warning sign.
  - **Tariff uncertainty and enterprise buying cycle extension are not temporary.** The thesis treats these as "cyclical" headwinds that will pass. But the current tariff environment under the Trump administration is structural, not cyclical. Enterprise budget scrutiny may be a permanent behavioral shift, especially with AI providing alternative information sources.
  - **Consulting segment trajectory suggests contagion.** Consulting fell -12.8% in Q4. The risk assessment correctly identifies that consulting is a "gateway drug" for research subscriptions. If consulting dries up, the pipeline for new research clients shrinks over 2-3 years. This second-order effect is entirely absent from the thesis's growth projections.
  - **Historical precedent: management credibility is damaged.** Gartner cut revenue guidance TWICE in 2025 (after Q2 and after Q3) before delivering the final 4% result. The market has reason to distrust "we expect acceleration" when the same management team guided for higher growth that never materialized.
- **Severidad:** **HIGH**
- **Resolucion sugerida:** Model 0% Y1, 3% Y2, 4% Y3-Y5 as base case. This is more consistent with CV trajectory and management credibility gap.

### 3. AI Disruption is "Partial" and "5-10 Year" Timeline

- **Thesis claim:** AI is a legitimate threat to consulting (9% of revenue) but NOT to core research (82%). AI cannot replicate analyst inquiry, Magic Quadrant authority, or proprietary benchmarking. Timeline 5-10 years.
- **Evidencia en contra:**
  - **The data is already showing disruption NOW, not in 5-10 years.** Management explicitly acknowledged on the Q4 earnings call that "the use of AI for advisory and consultancy services has led to slowing growth." This is not a future risk -- it is a present reality impacting revenue today.
  - **The bear case author Andriy Burkov's critique has structural merit.** Gartner's core model collects information FROM enterprise clients, synthesizes it, and sells it BACK to them. AI systems can increasingly perform this aggregation function. The unique value that justified $30K/seat (access to an analyst who synthesized collective intelligence) is being commoditized by AI that can do the same from public domain data.
  - **"Commodity research" is not 20-30% of the value stack -- it may be 50%+.** The thesis argues only the "bottom" of Gartner's value proposition is at risk. But most enterprise users access Gartner for written reports and research notes (the commodity layer), not for analyst inquiries (the premium layer). The typical enterprise seat holder reads reports and downloads frameworks. ChatGPT Enterprise, Perplexity Pro, and domain-specific AI tools can now generate comparable vendor comparisons, technology evaluations, and strategy frameworks.
  - **Enterprise SaaS per-seat pricing is shifting rapidly.** Gartner predicts that 70% of businesses will prefer usage-based pricing over per-seat models by 2026. Gartner ITSELF charges per-seat. The irony is that Gartner is forecasting the death of per-seat pricing while relying on it for its own revenue model.
  - **Magic Quadrant relevance is not invulnerable.** The "pay to play" criticism has persisted for years: vendors that are not Gartner clients struggle to get favorable placement. If AI-native dynamic vendor evaluation tools gain traction, the static, annual Magic Quadrant loses relevance. The fact that Gartner produces Magic Quadrants for AI categories does not protect it from AI disrupting the framework itself.
  - **GTS wallet retention at 96% in Q4 2025 confirms erosion is happening.** Below 100% means retained clients are REDUCING spend. The thesis dismisses this as "DOGE-driven" but management noted wallet retention was impacted even ex-federal. This is the early stage of the S-curve disruption pattern -- retention looks "fine" until it suddenly isn't.
  - **The thesis's own moat assessment scores AI disruption at "Media-Alta" probability with "Medio" impact.** But the 35% probability over 10 years for "AI commoditizes the bottom" may already be materializing in year 1-2, not year 5-10.
- **Severidad:** **HIGH**
- **Resolucion sugerida:** Model AI disruption as a PRESENT headwind reducing growth by 1-2pp annually, not a distant future scenario. Increase bear case probability from 25% to 35%.

### 4. QS 80 (Tier A) is Justified

- **Thesis claim:** QS Tool 73, adjusted to 80 with +7 for market position (0 to 7/8). Tier A.
- **Evidencia en contra:**
  - **The +7 adjustment is the largest single-item QS adjustment in our system's history.** Even ROP's controversial +22 adjustment was spread across multiple categories with per-item documentation. Gartner gets +7 from a single field (market position). While the #1 position is undeniable, the adjustment quantum is aggressive.
  - **FCF is DECLINING, not growing.** FY2024 FCF $1.383B, FY2025 FCF $1.2B (-13.2%), FY2026 guided $1.135B (-5.4%). The tool scored FCF consistency at 4/4 years positive (5/5 points). But FCF DECLINING while the thesis calls this a "compounder" is a contradiction. Quality compounders have GROWING FCF.
  - **Gross margin trend is DECLINING (0/5 in the tool).** The tool correctly gives 0 points for declining GM (69.5% -> 67.7%). This is a real quality deterioration that the +7 market position adjustment overrides. A Tier A compounder should not have declining margins AND declining FCF.
  - **Revenue growth is decelerating to DECLINE.** The tool shows 9.8% CAGR (5/10 on revenue CAGR) based on historical data. But forward trajectory is negative. A quality score should reflect forward quality, not backward quality.
  - **ROIC of 52% is partly a mathematical artifact of aggressive buybacks.** Gartner's equity is negative because buybacks exceeded retained earnings. This inflates ROIC (NOPAT / invested capital where capital base has shrunk). The 52% ROIC is real in one sense but misleading -- it partly reflects financial engineering, not operating excellence. If you add back cumulative buybacks to equity, ROIC would be much lower (15-20% range, still good but not exceptional).
  - **Capital allocation score 3/10 is correct but reveals a problem.** No dividend (0/5) and only 3.3% insider ownership (3/5). For a "Tier A compounder," having NO dividend and minimal insider alignment is unusual. CEO sold $17M at $507 while the stock is now at $153 -- this is a 70% wealth destruction for new buyers that the CEO avoided.
  - **The adversarial review pattern (Sessions 48-52) found QS inflation averaging +10-12 points.** A +7 single-item adjustment pushes Gartner from Tier B (73) to Tier A (80). At Tier B, the MoS requirements are higher (20-25% precedent) and the entry discipline is stricter. The Tier classification materially affects investment sizing and conviction.
- **Severidad:** **MODERATE**
- **Resolucion sugerida:** QS should be 73-77, Tier B. The market position adjustment is valid but should be +4 (not +7) given: (a) declining margins, (b) declining FCF, (c) revenue approaching decline, (d) per-seat pricing vulnerability. A #1 market position in a business facing structural disruption is worth less than #1 in a stable market. Adjusted QS: 73 + 4 = 77 (Tier B).

### 5. DOGE Impact is "Temporary and Quantifiable" at ~2.4% of CV

- **Thesis claim:** Federal CV was $126M at end of 2025 (2.4% of total), DOGE is a one-time reset, already priced in.
- **Evidencia en contra:**
  - **Federal CV was $275M in Dec 2024, fell to $225M by March 2025 (-18%).** The $126M figure in the thesis may refer to a different measurement. The actual dollar decline is larger than stated.
  - **DOGE is not a one-time event.** The Trump administration's government efficiency agenda is structural for the duration of the term (at minimum through 2028). Federal contract renewals will face scrutiny for years, not just one cycle.
  - **The broader signal matters more than the dollar amount.** DOGE shows that Gartner's subscriptions are NOT must-have for all customer segments. If the government can cancel Gartner without operational disruption, it undermines the thesis that Gartner is essential. Other budget-conscious enterprises may reach the same conclusion.
  - **Management stated only "slightly less than half" of eligible federal contracts renewed in Q1 2025.** A 50%+ non-renewal rate for an entire client segment is alarming, regardless of segment size.
- **Severidad:** **LOW-MODERATE**
- **Resolucion sugerida:** DOGE dollar impact is correctly quantified as small. But the structural/reputational signal deserves more weight. Model federal as permanently reduced by 30-40% (not temporary).

## Conflictos con Otros Analisis

### Thesis vs Risk Assessment

The risk assessment's probability-weighted FV range of **$170-195** is significantly below the thesis's $245 FV. The risk assessment assigns 30% probability to a severe bear case ($80-100), which the thesis barely acknowledges. The risk assessment rates overall risk as **MEDIUM-HIGH** with 5 risks at HIGH/CRITICAL level, while the thesis's tone is cautiously optimistic.

**My view:** The risk assessment is more calibrated than the thesis. The probability-weighted $170-195 range is a better anchor for FV than the thesis's $245.

### Thesis vs Moat Assessment

The moat assessment scores Gartner at **15/25** (lower end of WIDE) and explicitly notes the moat is "softer" than VRSK (19/25). The thesis treats the moat as a given, but the moat assessment raises the critical question: is this moat WIDE today but NARROW in 5 years? If so, the multiple should reflect the degradation path, not the current state.

The moat assessment also notes that **84% client retention is materially below VRSK's 92%** -- and below enterprise SaaS best-in-class. This is the weakest retention rate in our quality universe for a supposed Tier A company.

### Key Discrepancy: FCF Direction

The thesis treats Gartner as a "capital-light compounder" generating "$1.4B FCF." But the actual FCF trajectory is:
- FY2023: $1.053B
- FY2024: $1.383B (+31.4%)
- FY2025: $1.2B (-13.2%)
- FY2026E: $1.135B (-5.4%)

This is NOT a compounder trajectory. This is a business with lumpy, potentially peaking FCF. The thesis's OEY calculation, entry price, and fair value ALL depend on FCF growing. If FCF is declining, the entire edifice collapses.

## Veredicto Global

| Metric | Valor |
|--------|-------|
| Desafios HIGH/CRITICAL | **8** de 18 (1 CRITICAL, 7 HIGH) |
| Desafios no resueltos por thesis | **12** de 18 |
| Veredicto | **STRONG COUNTER** |
| Scoring | **14/19** |

### Interpretacion:

**STRONG COUNTER.** The thesis has serious problems that require material revision before any capital deployment.

The core issue is that the thesis values Gartner as a quality compounder (growing FCF, stable margins, 6% revenue growth resuming) when the financial reality shows a business in transition: declining FCF, declining margins, declining revenue (FY2026 guidance), and AI disruption actively impacting growth. The $245 FV is anchored on 2024 peak financials, not the deteriorating 2025-2026 trajectory.

**The thesis is NOT wrong about the franchise.** Gartner IS #1 by 6x, ROIC IS exceptional, and the Magic Quadrant IS valuable. But a quality franchise can still be overvalued if priced on historical earnings that are now declining.

**Risk/reward at $145-150 entry is unfavorable:**
- Upside to my adjusted FV ($160-185): 7-28%
- Downside to bear case ($80-100): 33-48%
- Risk/reward ratio: approximately 0.5x (want at minimum 2x)

**The appropriate entry, if thesis survives committee scrutiny, would be $100-120** -- which provides genuine MoS of 30-45% vs my adjusted FV of $160-185 and meaningful buffer vs the bear case.

### Counter-Thesis Strength Breakdown (1-5 per category):

| Category | Score | Reasoning |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Business model challenge | 4/5 | AI disruption is happening now, not theoretically. CV negative Q1. Wallet retention below 100%. |
| Valuation challenge | 5/5 | Stale FCF ($1.4B vs $1.2B actual), declining FCF trajectory, bear case too generous, OEY math wrong |
| Risk challenge | 4/5 | EPS engineering, CEO selling, securities investigations, SaaSpocalypse cluster risk |
| Timing challenge | 4/5 | Falling knife, no Q1 visibility, unfavorable risk/reward at proposed entry |
| QS/Tier challenge | 3/5 | +7 adjustment aggressive but directionally valid. Should be +4, making this Tier B not A. |
| **Average** | **4.0/5** | **Strong counter across all categories** |

## Recomendacion al Investment Committee

1. **DO NOT approve standing order at $145.** The risk/reward is unfavorable. Bear case downside ($80-100) is 3-4x the upside to risk-adjusted FV ($160-185).

2. **Reduce FV to $160-185 range.** Use FY2025 FCF ($1.2B) as the starting point, not FY2024. Model Y1 FCF decline per management guidance. Use WACC 9.5% minimum.

3. **Reclassify to Tier B (QS 77).** The +7 market position adjustment is too aggressive for a business with declining FCF, declining margins, and revenue approaching decline. A +4 adjustment is more appropriate, yielding QS 77 (Tier B).

4. **Wait for Q1 2026 results (May 2026) before revisiting.** Management promises "CV growth acceleration through 2026." Let them prove it. If Q1 2026 shows CV growth accelerating to 3-4% (ex-federal), the thesis gets stronger. If CV growth stays at 1% or declines further, the bear case strengthens materially.

5. **If revisiting after Q1 2026, entry should be $100-120** for adequate MoS against the real bear case. This implies the stock needs to decline another 20-35% from current levels.

6. **Monitor SaaSpocalypse cluster exposure.** Adding IT alongside ADBE, ROP, BYIT.L, and pipeline candidates MORN/VEEV/INTU/PAYC creates dangerous concentration in a single narrative bet.

## 🔄 META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres
- **FCF figure discrepancy needs resolution.** The thesis uses $1.4B (FY2024), but FY2025 actual was $1.2B. Some sources report slightly different figures. The exact Q4 2025 cash flow statement should be verified from the 10-K. The direction (declining) is clear regardless of the exact number.
- **Management's "acceleration" promise is ambiguous.** If Q1 2026 CV growth does accelerate to 5%+ (ex-federal), my counter-thesis would weaken materially. The question is whether to give management the benefit of the doubt or require proof. Given multiple guidance cuts in 2025, I lean toward requiring proof.
- **ROIC artifact assessment.** My claim that 52% ROIC is partly inflated by buyback-driven negative equity is directionally correct but I could not calculate the exact adjusted ROIC. This needs quantitative validation.
- **Insider buying at lower levels.** Pagliuca bought $7.8M at $229 (December 2025). This is genuine insider confidence but at a price 50% above current. It does not validate the $145 entry thesis directly.

### Limitaciones de Este Analisis
- Could not verify exact FY2025 FCF from 10-K filing (yfinance rate limited)
- Could not access Gartner's Q4 2025 earnings slide deck directly for detailed segment data
- Magic Quadrant revenue attribution (what % of research revenue is directly MQ-related) remains unknown
- Did not model the impact of SBC (stock-based compensation) on FCF quality -- SBC was likely significant given the EPS vs net income divergence

### Sugerencias para el Sistema
1. **SaaSpocalypse cluster risk tracker needed urgently.** We now have 3 positions (ADBE, BYIT.L, ROP standing order) and 5 pipeline candidates (IT, MORN, VEEV, INTU, PAYC) all affected by the same AI/per-seat narrative. A correlation matrix and cluster exposure limit should be established.
2. **FCF trajectory should be a standard quality check.** quality_scorer.py checks FCF consistency (positive/negative) but NOT direction (growing/declining). A company with declining FCF should NOT receive full marks on financial quality, regardless of ROIC level.
3. **Forward revenue trajectory vs backward CAGR.** The quality scorer shows 9.8% revenue CAGR but the forward trajectory is negative. Adding "most recent quarter revenue growth" alongside the CAGR would flag this divergence automatically.
4. **Insider net buy/sell ratio.** CEO selling $17M at highs while the stock drops 70% is a significant signal. This should be standardized in risk assessment.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator
1. **FCF $1.2B vs $1.4B -- which should anchor the valuation?** If 2025 actual is confirmed at $1.2B and 2026 guide is $1.135B, the thesis's OEY calculation is fundamentally flawed. Does this require thesis rewrite before committee?
2. **SaaSpocalypse cluster limit -- should we establish a maximum portfolio exposure to per-seat/AI-disruption names?** At what concentration does the narrative bet become imprudent?
3. **Tier B vs Tier A matters for entry discipline.** At Tier B, our precedents show 20-25% MoS minimum. At the risk assessment's $170-195 FV, current price offers 10-27% MoS -- borderline for Tier B. At my $160-185 FV, current price offers 4-21% -- insufficient for Tier B. How does the committee handle this?
4. **Should we wait for Q1 2026 results in May before adding to quality universe?** The quality universe currently has IT at entry $200 (stale). Updating to $145 based on an R1 thesis with a 14/19 DA counter seems premature.
