## Top 3 Riesgos Criticos

### 1. AI Disruption to Advisory/Research Model -- CRITICAL

- **Categoria:** Fundamental
- **Descripcion:** Gartner's core business is selling research subscriptions and advisory services to CIOs and technology leaders. AI (ChatGPT, Perplexity, domain-specific AI agents) threatens to replicate the lower-tier research product at near-zero cost. Enterprise clients paying $25K-$250K/year for analyst access may increasingly find that AI can synthesize market intelligence, vendor comparisons, and strategic frameworks that Gartner analysts provide. The threat is not theoretical -- Q4 2025 contract value grew only 1% YoY (flat for GTS), and management explicitly acknowledged "the use of AI for advisory and consultancy services has led to slowing growth."
- **Evidencia:**
  - Revenue growth decelerated from +9.8% CAGR (3yr) to +2.2% in Q4 2025
  - Contract value growth 1% overall, flat for Global Technology Sales (core segment)
  - 2026 guidance: revenue of $6.455B = 0.6% BELOW 2025 ($6.5B)
  - Consulting segment crashed -12.8% in Q4 2025 (most exposed to AI substitution)
  - Gross margin declining: 69.5% (2021) to 67.7% (2024)
  - Gartner itself projects 40% of enterprise software will shift to AI-based models by 2026
- **Probabilidad:** Alta -- AI substitution of knowledge work is accelerating. Lower-tier research products (syndicated reports, basic vendor analysis) are most vulnerable. Evidence is already showing in contract value deceleration.
- **Impacto si materializa:** Alto -- If AI substitutes 20-30% of lower-tier subscriptions over 3-5 years, revenue could decline 10-15% (lower-tier = ~50% of insights revenue but at lower margin). Combined with pricing pressure on remaining subscriptions. Estimated impact: 25-40% decline in equity value from current levels.
- **Mitigante:** Gartner's higher-tier products (1-on-1 analyst advisory, bespoke consulting for C-suite) are harder to replicate. Proprietary data and analyst expertise are inputs to AI models, not outputs. Brand trust for large enterprise decisions. Gartner is integrating AI into its own products (AI-augmented research delivery). Wallet retention remains high at 96-99%.
- **Kill condition?:** SI -- If contract value growth turns negative for 2+ consecutive quarters excluding federal impact, or if wallet retention drops below 90%, the thesis is invalidated.

### 2. EPS Engineering via Aggressive Buybacks Masking Revenue Weakness -- HIGH

- **Categoria:** Financiero / Governance
- **Descripcion:** Gartner repurchased $2.0B in stock during 2025, reducing share count by 8%. This inflated EPS (+20% CAGR) while revenue grew only 4% and profit dropped 39%. The Q4 2025 earnings release emphasized EPS beat while burying revenue miss and guidance for revenue DECLINE in 2026. Multiple law firms have launched securities fraud investigations into whether Gartner's presentation of financial metrics was misleading. The board authorized an additional $500M in buybacks (total authorization now $7.5B). This pattern is classic "financial engineering" -- using balance sheet capacity to manufacture per-share growth while the underlying business deteriorates.
- **Evidencia:**
  - 2025: $2.0B buybacks, 8% share count reduction, while revenue grew only 4%
  - Q4 2025: EPS $3.94 beat estimates, but revenue missed and Q4 EPS down 27.8% YoY
  - 2026 guidance: revenue $6.455B = DECLINE from 2025
  - CFO guided EPS based on 78M shares + "repurchases to offset dilution" -- investigation probes whether this was realistic given known revenue trends
  - Levi & Korsinsky, Gross Law Firm, Edelson Lechtzin all investigating
  - CEO sold $17M in shares at $507 (near highs) before stock collapsed
- **Probabilidad:** Alta (that the pattern continues) -- Management has demonstrated willingness to prioritize EPS optics over transparent communication of business fundamentals. The investigation may or may not result in material liability, but the behavior pattern signals governance concern.
- **Impacto si materializa:** Medio -- If SEC formalizes investigation or class action succeeds, potential settlements $50-200M (manageable for a $6.5B revenue company). Bigger risk: if buyback-funded EPS growth narrative is exposed, the market re-rates the company on revenue/FCF rather than EPS. At $6.5B revenue and declining, the stock may already be incorporating this risk.
- **Mitigante:** FCF remains strong ($1.4B in 2024). Buybacks are funded from operations, not debt issuance. Balance sheet has capacity (1.2x Net Debt/EBITDA). Multiple analyst firms still rate the stock as buy or hold (consensus PT ~$188).
- **Kill condition?:** SI -- If SEC opens formal investigation (not just ambulance-chaser law firms), or if buybacks exceed FCF generation forcing debt increase, or if free cash flow declines >20% while buybacks continue.

### 3. Value Trap / Structural Revenue Decline -- HIGH

- **Categoria:** Valoracion
- **Descripcion:** Gartner is 70% below its 52-week high. The market is pricing in a structural shift, not a cyclical downturn. The 2026 guidance for revenue DECLINE (first in Gartner's modern history outside of COVID) suggests this is not a temporary headwind. The stock went from $519 to $154 -- a destruction of ~$28B in market value. The question is whether at P/E 15.9x (reasonable for a quality business) the selloff is overdone, or whether revenue continues declining and the current P/E is still too high for a low/no-growth business.
- **Evidencia:**
  - 2026 revenue guidance: $6.455B = -0.6% vs 2025 (DECLINE)
  - Contract value growth: 1% overall, flat in core GTS segment
  - Revenue growth trajectory: +9.8% CAGR -> +4% FY2025 -> decline in 2026
  - Every major sell-side firm cut price targets (Truist: $300->$170, BMO: $258->$188, Wells Fargo: $218->$150)
  - Wells Fargo assigned UNDERWEIGHT with $150 target (stock is at $153)
  - Selling environment described as "challenging with no expected improvement in 2026"
  - Consulting segment in freefall (-12.8% Q4)
- **Probabilidad:** Media -- Management expects CV growth to "accelerate throughout 2026." Wallet retention is 96-99%. But the forward guidance is for revenue decline, and management credibility is dented after multiple guidance cuts in 2025.
- **Impacto si materializa:** Alto -- If revenue continues declining 2-5% per year for 3+ years while AI disruption accelerates, fair value could be $100-120 (30-40% downside from current). The ROIC of 52% means nothing if the capital base is shrinking. A company with declining revenue and no dividend is dead money at best, value trap at worst.
- **Mitigante:** P/E 15.9x is cheap vs historical 25-40x. ROIC 52% and FCF $1.4B suggest the franchise is still generating real cash. Stock is near Wells Fargo's $150 PT (floor case). Insider buying at lower levels ($9.8M in last 3 months, Pagliuca bought $7.8M). If CV growth does accelerate as guided, this is a classic oversold opportunity.
- **Kill condition?:** SI -- If FY2026 actual revenue comes in below $6.4B (below even the guided decline) or if 2027 guidance shows continued decline, this is structural and the stock is dead money.

## Riesgos NO Mencionados en Thesis

(No thesis exists yet -- this is a pre-thesis independent risk assessment. These risks MUST be incorporated into any future thesis.)

| Riesgo | Severidad | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| AI disruption to lower-tier research products | HIGH | Core existential risk. Revenue already decelerating. |
| EPS engineering via aggressive buybacks | HIGH | $2B/yr buybacks mask revenue weakness. Securities investigations active. |
| Revenue DECLINE guided for 2026 | HIGH | First guided decline in modern history. Structural, not cyclical? |
| Consulting segment collapse (-12.8% Q4) | HIGH | Smallest segment but fastest deteriorating. AI most directly substitutable. |
| CEO sold $17M at $507 while guiding bullish | MEDIUM | Classic insider timing concern. Offset by other insiders buying at lower levels. |
| Per-seat pricing model vulnerability | MEDIUM | CFOs report 42% expect AI-driven headcount cuts. Fewer seats = fewer Gartner subscriptions. |
| DOGE federal contract cancellations | LOW | Only 4% of CV. Already largely absorbed. But signals broader government austerity. |
| SaaSpocalypse contagion/sentiment | MEDIUM | Gartner caught in sector-wide information services selloff (~$1T). Guilt by association. |
| Conference revenue volatility | MEDIUM | 12% of revenue, 51% margin. Cyclical and vulnerable to travel budget cuts. |
| Combined CEO/Chair governance | LOW | Mitigated by Lead Independent Director and independent committees. |
| FCPA prior violations (South Africa) | LOW | Settled 2023. Compliance reforms in place. But pattern of compliance issues. |

## Kill Conditions Sugeridas

Based on this risk assessment, the following kill conditions should be added to any future thesis:

1. **KC#1 -- Contract Value Turns Negative (ex-Federal):** If CV growth excluding US federal government turns negative for 2 consecutive quarters, the subscription moat is breaking. EXIT.

2. **KC#2 -- Wallet Retention Below 90%:** Current GTS 96%, GBS 99%. If wallet retention drops below 90%, clients are churning, not just spending less. EXIT.

3. **KC#3 -- Revenue Decline Accelerates:** 2026 guidance is -0.6%. If actual 2026 revenue comes in below $6.3B (i.e., decline exceeds -3%), the revenue trajectory is structural decline, not temporary pause. EXIT or deep review.

4. **KC#4 -- SEC Formal Investigation:** If the securities fraud investigations escalate from ambulance-chaser law firms to a formal SEC enforcement action regarding financial metrics presentation, this becomes a governance crisis. EXIT.

5. **KC#5 -- FCF Deterioration Below $1B:** Current FCF $1.4B. If FCF drops below $1B while buybacks continue at $2B/yr pace, the company is destroying its balance sheet. EXIT.

6. **KC#6 -- AI Substitution Evidence:** If a major competitor (McKinsey, BCG, Forrester) launches an AI-native research product at <50% of Gartner's price point and gains significant market share, the disintermediation thesis is real. Deep review.

## Riesgo Agregado

- **Numero de riesgos HIGH+CRITICAL:** 5 (1 CRITICAL + 4 HIGH)
- **Riesgos correlacionados?** SI -- Risks #1 (AI disruption), #3 (value trap), and #6 (consulting decline) are highly correlated. AI disruption is the common root cause driving revenue deceleration, consulting collapse, and the market's re-rating. If AI disruption is less severe than feared, all three risks diminish simultaneously. If it accelerates, all three compound.
- **Risk Score Final: MEDIUM-HIGH**

**Justification for MEDIUM-HIGH (not HIGH or VERY HIGH):**
- The CRITICAL risk (AI disruption) has genuine mitigants: 96-99% wallet retention, proprietary data, embedded workflows, high-tier advisory differentiation
- The company is still generating $1.4B FCF with ROIC 52% -- the franchise is producing real cash today
- Insider buying at lower levels ($9.8M, Pagliuca $7.8M) suggests informed insiders see value
- P/E 15.9x already discounts significant growth deterioration (down from 35x+)
- Near-term risks (DOGE, conference cyclicality) are manageable and small
- BUT: the revenue DECLINE guidance for 2026 is unprecedented and the AI narrative has substance (not just noise)
- The securities investigations, while likely ambulance-chasing, reveal a governance pattern of prioritizing EPS optics

**Why not MEDIUM:** The correlation between AI disruption, revenue decline, and consulting collapse creates compounding risk. One CRITICAL risk with four correlated HIGH risks warrants a score above MEDIUM. The 70% stock decline is not just market overreaction -- there is real fundamental deterioration happening.

**Why not VERY HIGH:** The financial position is strong (1.2x leverage, $1.4B FCF, interest coverage 11.6x). There is no liquidity crisis. The subscription model provides visibility. Wallet retention is still very high. The company has significant optionality to adapt (integrating AI, shifting product mix). And at $154, a significant amount of bad news is already priced in.

## Quantitative Risk-Adjusted Valuation Impact

| Scenario | Probability | Revenue Trajectory | Fair Value Estimate | vs Current ($154) |
|----------|------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Bear (structural decline)** | 30% | Revenue -3% to -5%/yr for 3+ years | $80-100 | -35% to -48% |
| **Base (stabilization)** | 45% | Revenue flat 2026, +2-4% from 2027 | $180-220 | +17% to +43% |
| **Bull (AI-augmented growth)** | 25% | Revenue +5-8%/yr, AI products drive expansion | $280-350 | +82% to +127% |
| **Probability-weighted** | 100% | -- | $170-195 | +10% to +27% |

The probability-weighted range suggests modest upside from current levels, but the bear scenario is severe enough to warrant significant caution. The entry point matters enormously -- at $154, you are already near Wells Fargo's $150 floor, but the bear case has meaningful downside.

## META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres

1. **AI disruption severity is the central uncertainty.** I classify it as CRITICAL/High probability, but the truth is nobody knows how fast AI will substitute professional research/advisory. Gartner's wallet retention at 96-99% suggests clients are NOT leaving yet. But retention lags disruption -- clients may be in the "evaluating alternatives" phase before churning. The speed of this transition is unknowable.

2. **The 70% stock decline.** It is difficult to separate genuine fundamental deterioration from SaaSpocalypse panic selling. VRSK (insurance data, near-monopoly) is also down 45% in the same period. WKL.AS (professional info services) is down 66%. This suggests a sector-wide repricing, not just Gartner-specific problems. If the selloff is partly indiscriminate, the risk is lower than the price action suggests.

3. **Revenue guidance credibility.** Management guided for revenue decline in 2026 but expects CV growth to "accelerate throughout 2026." These statements are in tension. CV growth acceleration should eventually translate to revenue growth. Either management is sandbagging guidance (which would be positive), or CV acceleration is too modest to overcome headwinds (negative). I cannot resolve this with available data.

4. **Per-seat pricing exposure.** Gartner sells subscriptions to enterprises, not per-seat SaaS licenses. But enterprise subscriptions are implicitly sized by the number of users/seats that access the service. If enterprises cut headcount by 5-10% due to AI, they may renegotiate Gartner contracts downward even without churning. This risk is real but hard to quantify without knowing Gartner's pricing mechanics in detail.

### Riesgos que Podrian Estar Subestimados

1. **Consulting segment decline.** I classify it as HIGH but note it is only 8% of revenue. However, consulting is the "gateway drug" -- many research subscriptions originate from consulting engagements. If consulting dries up, it could reduce the pipeline for research subscriptions over 2-3 years. This second-order effect is not captured in my matrix.

2. **Securities investigations.** I lean toward dismissing these as ambulance-chasing (common after >20% drops). But the specific allegation -- that EPS guidance was set with share-count assumptions designed to make declining revenue look acceptable -- has substance. If discovery reveals management knowingly used buybacks to mask deterioration, the governance damage could be severe.

### Discrepancias con Thesis

No thesis exists yet. This assessment should INFORM the thesis, not react to it. The fundamental-analyst should weigh these risks heavily, particularly:
- The AI disruption risk is not a "maybe someday" risk -- it is already showing in revenue deceleration
- The revenue DECLINE guidance for 2026 is a hard data point that cannot be dismissed
- The EPS engineering pattern should be explicitly addressed in any bull case

### Sugerencias para el Sistema

1. **SaaSpocalypse cluster monitoring.** We now have VRSK, IT, and potentially MORN/VEEV all in the information services / SaaS space being evaluated simultaneously. All are caught in the same sector-wide selloff. We need a framework to assess whether we are over-concentrating in a single narrative bet ("the selloff is overdone"). If the SaaSpocalypse reflects a genuine structural repricing, holding 3-4 positions in this space would be high-correlated risk.

2. **Add "revenue trajectory" as a standard risk factor.** The quality_scorer.py shows Revenue CAGR +9.8%, which looks strong. But the CAGR is backward-looking. The forward trajectory is DECLINING. A tool that shows historical CAGR alongside most recent quarter growth rate would flag this divergence automatically.

3. **Insider transaction analysis.** The CEO selling $17M at $507 while other insiders buy at $150-160 is a meaningful signal. Adding insider transaction tracking as a standard part of risk assessment would be valuable.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator

1. **Portfolio SaaSpocalypse exposure.** If we proceed with IT, VRSK, MORN, and VEEV, what is our total exposure to the "information services / SaaS repricing" theme? Should we set a concentration limit for this cluster?

2. **Revenue decline tolerance.** We have never bought a company guiding for revenue decline. Is this a precedent we want to set? Our framework emphasizes quality compounders with growth. IT is a quality franchise (ROIC 52%) but with negative growth guidance. How does this fit Principio 9 (Quality Gravitation)?

3. **Entry point vs risk.** At $154, IT is near the floor estimates ($150 Wells Fargo). But the bear case is $80-100. Is the risk/reward asymmetry sufficient for a Tier B position? The 30% bear scenario probability implies meaningful downside. Should we wait for either (a) evidence of CV acceleration in Q1 2026, or (b) a lower price ($120-130) that provides more cushion against the bear case?
