# Moat Assessment: IT (Gartner, Inc.)

## Date: 2026-02-13

## Classification: WIDE

Gartner possesses a WIDE moat built on three mutually reinforcing sources: (1) exceptionally high switching costs from deep embedding in enterprise IT decision-making workflows -- Magic Quadrants and Gartner research have become the de facto standard for how enterprises evaluate technology vendors and make multi-million dollar purchasing decisions, (2) powerful intangible assets including the Magic Quadrant brand (an industry standard cited in virtually every enterprise software procurement), proprietary research methodologies, and a 45+ year reputation as the authoritative voice in IT advisory, and (3) meaningful cost advantages from the largest analyst bench in the industry (2,100+ analysts) amortized across 15,000+ enterprise clients, creating content at a cost-per-insight that no competitor can match. The moat is supported by ROIC accelerating from 27% to 52% over 4 years, consistently 30-43pp above WACC, gross margins 13pp above sector, and ~82% subscription-based recurring revenue.

**Critical context:** The stock is down 70% from its 52-week high of $519 to $154, driven by a convergence of (a) Q4 2025 earnings disappointment with weak 2026 guidance, (b) US federal government spending cuts (DOGE), and (c) the SaaSpocalypse AI disruption narrative. My assessment: the DOGE impact is real but contained (~4% of contract value), the weak guidance is concerning but likely cyclical, and the AI disruption narrative is significantly OVERSTATED for Gartner's core research/advisory business. However, Gartner faces a more nuanced AI threat than VRSK -- AI can partially substitute for analyst-written research in a way that it cannot substitute for actuarial statistical data.

## Fuentes de Moat Identificadas

| Fuente | Presente | Evidencia | Durabilidad | Trayectoria |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Switching costs | SI (STRONG) | 84% client retention rate, 96-103% wallet retention. Magic Quadrants and Gartner research embedded in enterprise procurement processes. Multi-year subscription contracts averaging ~$30K/seat. CIOs reference Gartner in board presentations and vendor negotiations. 71% of Fortune 1000 are clients. | 15-20 years | Stable (slightly pressured by AI alternatives for lower-complexity research) |
| Network effects | SI (MODERATE) | Larger analyst bench (2,100+) produces more comprehensive research, attracting more clients, generating more data/peer insights, improving research quality. Gartner Peer Insights creates two-sided network. Tech vendors NEED to be in Magic Quadrants because buyers use them -- self-reinforcing vendor-buyer loop. | 15-20 years | Stable (Peer Insights growing but not yet at dominant scale) |
| Intangible assets | SI (STRONG) | Magic Quadrant brand is the gold standard for IT vendor evaluation -- no competitor has a comparable framework. 45+ years of accumulated research methodology and institutional knowledge. 2,100+ analyst bench is an unmatched knowledge asset. Hype Cycle, Cool Vendors, and other proprietary frameworks are widely cited. | 20+ years | Stable (brand deeply embedded in IT culture, but AI tools creating new knowledge pathways) |
| Cost advantages | SI (MODERATE) | Largest research organization in IT advisory. Fixed cost of producing a Magic Quadrant or research note spread across 15,000+ enterprise clients vs Forrester's ~1,500 clients. Gross margin 67.7% vs Forrester's ~56%. Revenue/analyst ratio significantly higher than competitors. | 15-20 years | Stable |
| Efficient scale | NO (WEAK) | The IT advisory market is large enough ($200-250B+ for information services broadly) to support multiple competitors. Forrester, IDC, McKinsey, and boutique firms all compete profitably. No natural monopoly characteristics like VRSK's statistical agent designation. | N/A | N/A |

## Evidencia Cuantitativa

### IT (Gartner) vs Information Services Peers

| Metrica | IT (Gartner) | VRSK | FDS | SPGI | MCO | Peer Median | Diferencia vs Median |
|---------|-------------|------|-----|------|-----|-------------|----------------------|
| ROIC (latest) | 52.1% | 38.3% | 18.7% | 8.3%* | 24.4% | 24.4% | +27.7pp |
| ROIC-WACC Spread | +43.4pp | +30.5pp | +11.1pp | N/A* | +12.8pp | +12.8pp | +30.6pp |
| Gross Margin (2024) | 67.7% | 68.7% | 52.7% | 69.1% | 72.6% | 68.7% | -1.0pp |
| FCF Margin (2024) | 22.1% | 31.9% | 26.6% | 31.9% | 35.6% | 31.9% | -9.8pp |
| Revenue CAGR (3yr) | 9.8% | 5.4% | 8.0% | 12.7% | 4.5% | 8.0% | +1.8pp |
| ND/EBITDA | 1.2x | 1.9x | 1.4x | 1.6x | 1.5x | 1.5x | -0.3x |
| Subscription % rev | ~82% | ~83% | ~95% | ~80% | ~95% | ~83% | -1pp |
| P/E (current) | 15.9x | 27.5x | 12.9x | 27.1x | 33.4x | 27.1x | -11.2x |

*SPGI ROIC distorted by IHS Markit merger accounting. Not comparable.

**Key observation:** Gartner's ROIC of 52.1% is the highest in this peer group by a wide margin. This is partly a structural advantage (capital-light model with negative working capital and high intellectual capital) and partly a result of aggressive buybacks reducing the capital base. The trajectory is strongly upward (27% -> 30% -> 36% -> 52%), suggesting genuine operating leverage as the business scales. However, note that FCF margin (22.1%) is below peers -- Gartner's conferences and consulting segments dilute the overall FCF margin compared to pure data companies like VRSK.

**Gross margin declining:** 69.5% -> 69.1% -> 67.8% -> 67.7% over 4 years. This is a mild but consistent downward trend, suggesting either (a) product mix shift toward lower-margin segments (conferences, consulting), or (b) pricing pressure in core research. This is a yellow flag for moat health that must be monitored.

### ROIC Persistence

| Year | ROIC | > WACC (8.8%)? |
|------|------|----------------|
| 2021 | 27.1% | YES |
| 2022 | 30.2% | YES |
| 2023 | 35.9% | YES |
| 2024 | 52.1% | YES |

**ROIC persistence: 4/4 years above WACC.** Trajectory is strongly accelerating. Note that pre-2021 ROIC history is not available from our tool, but Gartner has been a public company since 2005 and has maintained ROIC consistently above cost of capital throughout its modern era (post-2010 when it shed legacy consulting). The accelerating ROIC reflects operating leverage in the subscription business plus aggressive share buybacks reducing invested capital.

### Revenue Breakdown (FY2024 / FY2025)

| Segment | FY2024 Rev | % of Total | FY2025 Rev Est | Growth | Margin Profile |
|---------|-----------|------------|----------------|--------|----------------|
| Research (Insights) | $5.13B | 82% | ~$5.37B | ~5% | HIGH (subscription, 82%+ recurring) |
| Conferences | $583M | 9% | ~$650M | ~10% | MEDIUM (event-driven, lumpy) |
| Consulting | $559M | 9% | ~$555M | ~-1% | LOW (project-based, declining) |
| **Total** | **$6.27B** | **100%** | **~$6.5B** | **~4%** | |

**Critical: 82% of revenue is recurring subscription research.** This is the moat-bearing segment. Conferences (9%) add brand value but are event-driven. Consulting (9%) is the weakest segment -- project-based, low-margin, and the most vulnerable to AI disruption. The market may be over-weighting the consulting weakness vs the research durability.

### Client Metrics (Q4 2025)

| Metric | Value | Trend | Significance |
|--------|-------|-------|--------------|
| Client retention rate | 84% | Stable (up ~100bps YoY) | Good but not exceptional vs SaaS benchmarks |
| Wallet retention (GTS) | 96% (Q4) | Down from ~103% in 2024 | Concerning -- below 100% means SHRINKING wallet |
| Wallet retention (GBS ex-Fed) | >100% | Strong | Enterprise function leaders expanding |
| Contract value (total) | $5.2B | +1% (headline), +4% ex-Fed | DOGE is the drag |
| Fortune 1000 penetration | 71% | Stable | High but leaves 29% room |
| Total enterprise clients | 15,000+ | Stable | Diversified -- no single client concentration |

**DOGE impact quantified:** US Federal government contract value fell from $275M to $225M (-18%) in Q1 2025 alone, and only half of eligible federal contracts renewed. Federal represents ~4% of total contract value. This is a contained, non-recurring headwind that should largely cycle through by H2 2026.

## Moat Source Deep Dive

### 1. Switching Costs -- Score: 6/8

**Evidence:**

- **Embedded in enterprise decision-making:** Gartner research is not a "nice-to-have" -- it is the standard toolkit that CIOs, CTOs, and IT procurement teams use to evaluate technology vendors, justify purchasing decisions to boards, and benchmark their IT spending. A CIO presenting a technology strategy to the board WITHOUT referencing Gartner research is at a disadvantage.
- **Magic Quadrant as procurement standard:** The Magic Quadrant has become THE framework by which enterprises shortlist technology vendors. Vendors that are NOT in the Leaders quadrant face significant headwinds in enterprise sales. This creates a self-reinforcing loop: enterprises use Magic Quadrants because vendors participate in them, and vendors participate because enterprises use them.
- **Multi-year contracts, seat-based pricing:** Average subscription of ~$30K per seat, multi-year contracts with annual escalators. Enterprises typically have 5-50+ seats depending on size. Switching to Forrester or IDC means retraining analysts, rebuilding reference frameworks, losing historical benchmark data, and losing access to Gartner's analyst inquiry service.
- **84% client retention:** This is solid but NOT exceptional by SaaS standards (where 90%+ is typical for enterprise). The 84% retention rate suggests that while switching costs are real, they are not insurmountable. Some clients DO leave -- likely smaller companies or those that downgrade to fewer seats.
- **Wallet retention 96-103%:** The more important metric. A 103% wallet retention rate (pre-DOGE) means existing clients are EXPANDING their Gartner usage each year. The Q4 2025 dip to 96% on GTS is concerning and reflects both DOGE and budget tightening.
- **71% Fortune 1000 penetration:** Very high. These enterprises have Gartner deeply embedded in their IT governance processes. Switching away requires a cultural change, not just a software migration.

**Durability: 15-20 years.** The switching costs are rooted in institutional behavior and procurement culture, not in technical lock-in. This makes them durable but potentially vulnerable to generational shifts (e.g., a new generation of CIOs who grew up with AI tools rather than analyst reports). The 15-20 year estimate reflects uncertainty about AI's long-term impact on the advisory model.

**Not 7/8 or 8/8 because:** (a) 84% client retention is below enterprise SaaS best-in-class (92%+ at VRSK), suggesting some clients find alternatives acceptable; (b) Gartner's switching costs are "soft" (behavioral, cultural) rather than "hard" (regulatory, technical integration), making them more susceptible to erosion if a credible alternative emerges; (c) AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude CAN provide a partial substitute for basic technology research queries -- they cannot replicate the analyst inquiry model, but they reduce the perceived necessity of a $30K subscription for basic research access.

### 2. Network Effects -- Score: 3/5

**Evidence:**

- **Analyst bench -> research breadth -> client value:** With 2,100+ analysts (vs Forrester's ~1,000, IDC's ~1,300), Gartner covers more technology categories with more depth. More comprehensive coverage attracts more enterprise clients. More client engagement generates more data (via client inquiries, peer insights, conferences). This data improves research quality, attracting more clients. This is a real but moderate network effect.
- **Vendor-buyer loop in Magic Quadrants:** Technology vendors PAY to participate in Magic Quadrant evaluations (via consulting fees, conference sponsorships). They do this because enterprise buyers USE Magic Quadrants. Buyers use Magic Quadrants because vendors participate. This creates a two-sided market dynamic where Gartner sits at the center.
- **Gartner Peer Insights:** A user-generated review platform where 1M+ enterprise decision-makers share vendor evaluations. This adds a crowdsourced data layer to Gartner's analyst research, creating a data network effect. However, competitors (G2, TrustRadius) also operate in this space.
- **Conferences as network:** Gartner Symposium and sector-specific events bring together thousands of CIOs, vendors, and analysts. These create a networking effect where attendees come because other decision-makers attend.

**Durability: 15-20 years.** The vendor-buyer loop around Magic Quadrants is self-reinforcing and hard to disrupt. However, the network effect is more "ecosystem gravity" than a true increasing-returns-to-scale network effect like a social network or marketplace.

**Only 3/5 because:** (a) Network effects are present but moderate -- the product does improve with scale, but not with the exponential dynamics of platforms like visa or Google; (b) Peer Insights faces competition from G2, TrustRadius, and other review platforms; (c) The vendor-buyer loop could weaken if a new framework (e.g., an AI-powered dynamic vendor evaluation tool) gained traction and reduced the relevance of static annual Magic Quadrant reports.

### 3. Intangible Assets -- Score: 4/4

**Evidence:**

- **Magic Quadrant brand:** This is Gartner's crown jewel. The Magic Quadrant is arguably the most influential single framework in enterprise technology. It is cited in vendor sales presentations, enterprise RFPs, board presentations, and technology media globally. No competitor has produced a framework with comparable influence (Forrester Wave is a distant second). The brand value is immeasurable.
- **Hype Cycle, Cool Vendors, and other frameworks:** Gartner has created multiple proprietary research frameworks that have become industry lexicon. The "Hype Cycle" is used across non-IT contexts. These frameworks are essentially trademarked intellectual property embedded in business culture.
- **45+ year research archive:** Decades of accumulated research, methodologies, data, and analyst insights. This institutional knowledge cannot be replicated overnight. A new entrant starts with zero historical data and zero analyst reputation.
- **Analyst reputation and access:** Gartner analysts are recognized authorities in their domains. CIOs schedule "inquiry" calls with specific Gartner analysts to get their opinion before making major purchasing decisions. This personal-reputation-based advisory model is extremely sticky.
- **Pricing power:** Gartner has historically raised prices 3-5% annually above inflation without significant client attrition. This is direct evidence of brand premium and lack of substitutes.

**Durability: 20+ years.** The Magic Quadrant brand is deeply embedded in enterprise technology culture. Dislodging it would require not just a better product but a cultural shift in how enterprises evaluate technology. This takes decades, not years.

**Full 4/4 because:** The combination of Magic Quadrant (the industry standard for vendor evaluation), proprietary research frameworks (Hype Cycle, etc.), 45+ years of institutional knowledge, and demonstrated pricing power creates an intangible asset package that no competitor can replicate. Unlike patents, these intangibles do not expire.

### 4. Cost Advantages -- Score: 2/4

**Evidence:**

- **Scale economics in research production:** Gartner produces a Magic Quadrant or research note once and distributes it to 15,000+ enterprise clients. Forrester distributes similar content to ~1,500 clients. The cost per client of producing research is an order of magnitude lower for Gartner.
- **Revenue per analyst:** Gartner generates ~$3B per year from its ~2,100 analysts (Research segment), or ~$1.4M revenue per analyst. Forrester generates ~$390M from ~1,000 analysts, or ~$390K per analyst. Gartner's analysts generate 3.6x more revenue per person, reflecting dramatically better monetization.
- **Gross margin 67.7% vs sector 55%:** The +12.7pp gross margin premium over the sector median reflects the capital-light, high-leverage economics of subscription research.
- **Conference economics:** Gartner conferences are highly profitable, with margins estimated at 30%+ and growing. The brand allows premium pricing for both attendees ($4,000+ per ticket) and sponsors.

**Durability: 15-20 years.** Cost advantages are driven by scale, which is durable as long as Gartner maintains its market leadership position.

**Only 2/4 because:** While scale economics are real and significant, Gartner does not compete primarily on cost. Clients do not choose Gartner because it is cheap -- they choose it because of the brand and research quality. The cost advantage is a secondary benefit of market leadership, not the primary moat.

### 5. Efficient Scale -- Score: 0/4

**Evidence:**

- **Market is NOT efficiently scaled:** The IT advisory and information services market is large ($200B+) and supports multiple profitable competitors: Forrester ($390M revenue), IDC ($500M+), McKinsey (IT advisory division), Accenture Research, countless boutique firms.
- **Low barriers to entry for niche players:** While building a Gartner-scale operation is difficult, niche research firms (e.g., TSIA for technology services, RedMonk for developers) can enter specific verticals profitably.
- **No natural monopoly characteristics:** Unlike VRSK's regulatory-designated statistical agent role, Gartner's market position is earned through quality and brand, not structural barriers to competition.

**Not applicable for moat scoring.** The market is too large and fragmented for efficient scale to be a relevant moat source.

## Amenazas al Moat

| Amenaza | Probabilidad | Impacto | Horizonte | Detalle |
|---------|-------------|---------|-----------|---------|
| AI substitution of basic research | Media-Alta | Medio | 3-7 years | This is the CRITICAL threat and the core question for Gartner's moat durability. AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, etc.) can already answer many basic technology questions that previously required a Gartner subscription. "What is the best CRM software?" or "Compare AWS vs Azure vs GCP" -- these queries are now adequately answered by AI without paying $30K/year. HOWEVER: AI cannot replicate (a) the analyst inquiry model (live conversation with a domain expert who knows YOUR company's context), (b) proprietary data and benchmarks, (c) the institutional authority of a Magic Quadrant placement, or (d) forward-looking strategic advisory. The threat is PARTIAL: AI erodes the bottom of Gartner's value proposition (commodity research) while the top (strategic advisory, Magic Quadrants, benchmarking) remains defensible. |
| Per-seat pricing / AI headcount reduction | Media | Medio | 2-5 years | Gartner charges ~$30K per seat. If AI reduces the number of IT analysts, consultants, and procurement professionals at enterprises (the people who USE Gartner), the addressable seat base shrinks. Per-seat pricing declined from 21% to 15% of SaaS pricing models industry-wide in one year. However, Gartner's seat usage is concentrated among senior decision-makers (CIOs, VPs, Directors) -- these roles are LESS vulnerable to AI displacement than junior analysts. Additionally, AI creates NEW buyer categories (AI/ML teams, data scientists) who need Gartner-style guidance on an unfamiliar technology landscape. |
| US federal government spending cuts (DOGE) | Alta (already materializing) | Bajo (contained) | 1-2 years | Already quantified: federal CV fell $50M+ in 2025. Federal is only ~4% of total CV. Management expects this headwind to be largely cycled through in H2 2026. This is NOT a moat threat -- it is a temporary client segment disruption. |
| SaaSpocalypse multiple compression | Alta (already materializing) | Medio | 1-3 years | Gartner's P/E has compressed from ~35x (2024) to 15.9x. This is a valuation reset, not a moat erosion. However, if the market concludes that Gartner's growth rate has structurally decelerated from ~10% to ~5%, the re-rating may be permanent. 2026 guidance of 2% FX-neutral growth reinforces this concern. |
| Consulting segment disruption | Media-Alta | Bajo | 2-5 years | Consulting is only 9% of revenue and DECLINING (-12.8% in Q4 2025). This segment IS vulnerable to AI substitution (project-based advisory work). However, because it is small and low-margin, its erosion has limited impact on the overall moat. The risk is that consulting weakness bleeds into negative perception of the core research business. |
| Forrester/IDC competitive response | Baja | Bajo | 5-10 years | Forrester and IDC have been competing with Gartner for decades without gaining meaningful market share. Gartner's revenue is 10x+ Forrester's and 6x+ IDC's. No evidence of competitive dynamics changing materially. |

## Escenarios de Erosion

### 1. Most Probable: AI Commoditizes the Bottom of Gartner's Value Stack (35% probability over 10 years)

In this scenario, AI tools progressively erode demand for Gartner's basic research content. Enterprises cancel lower-tier subscriptions because AI provides "good enough" answers to basic technology questions. However, premium subscriptions (analyst inquiry, strategic advisory, Magic Quadrant, benchmarking, peer insights) remain defensible. The net effect: (a) client retention falls from 84% to 75-78% as smaller clients and lower-tier subscribers leave, (b) wallet retention remains strong (>100%) as remaining premium clients expand usage, (c) revenue shifts from "broad and shallow" to "narrow and deep," (d) total revenue growth stagnates at 2-4% (vs historical 8-10%), (e) margins improve as low-value/high-support clients leave.

**Impact on moat:** Narrows from WIDE to NARROW. The moat survives but contracts to the premium advisory/data layer. Gartner becomes a more profitable but slower-growing business.

**Mitigant:** Gartner is actively integrating AI into its own products (AI-powered research summaries, automated benchmark tools). If Gartner can be the AI tool that enterprises use FOR technology research (rather than a generic AI tool), the moat shifts from "human analyst knowledge" to "AI + proprietary data + methodology." This would PRESERVE the moat.

### 2. Tail Risk: Magic Quadrant Relevance Declines (15% probability over 10 years)

The Magic Quadrant is a static, annual publication that evaluates vendors based on analyst judgment. In an AI-native world, a dynamic, continuously updated, data-driven vendor evaluation tool could emerge that is more timely and less subjective. If such a tool gained enterprise adoption, it would undermine the core of Gartner's brand moat.

**Why this matters:** If the Magic Quadrant loses its status as the gold standard for vendor evaluation, the vendor-buyer network effect unravels. Vendors stop investing in Magic Quadrant participation. Enterprises stop requiring it in procurement. The entire ecosystem gravitates toward the new framework.

**Mitigant:** Institutional inertia is enormous. The Magic Quadrant has survived the internet, cloud computing, and mobile -- three prior technology revolutions that were each predicted to make analyst firms irrelevant. Procurement culture changes slowly. However, AI is a more direct threat because it attacks the KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION process itself, not just the distribution mechanism.

## Moat Score: 15/25

| Component | Score | Max | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Switching costs | 6 | 8 | Deep embedding in enterprise IT procurement and decision-making processes. 84% retention, 71% Fortune 1000 penetration. Magic Quadrant as standard framework. Behavioral/cultural lock-in rather than technical/regulatory. Not 7+ because 84% retention leaves room vs best-in-class (92%+ VRSK), and switching costs are "soft" -- AI creating viable partial substitute for basic research. |
| Network effects | 3 | 5 | Real vendor-buyer loop around Magic Quadrants. Scale advantage in analyst bench -> research breadth. Peer Insights growing. But network effects are moderate, not exponential. Competitors exist profitably. G2/TrustRadius compete in peer reviews. |
| Intangible assets | 4 | 4 | Magic Quadrant is the gold standard for IT vendor evaluation -- full marks. Hype Cycle and other proprietary frameworks are culturally embedded. 45+ years of institutional knowledge and analyst reputation. Demonstrated pricing power (3-5% annual increases). No competitor has a comparable brand asset. |
| Cost advantages | 2 | 4 | Real scale economics (3.6x revenue/analyst vs Forrester, 12.7pp gross margin premium). But cost advantage is secondary to brand/switching costs. Gartner does not compete on cost -- it competes on quality and authority. |
| Efficient scale | 0 | 4 | Market is large ($200B+) and supports multiple profitable competitors. No natural monopoly. Not a relevant moat source. |

**Total: 15/25**

## Comparison: IT (Gartner) vs VRSK (Verisk) Moat

| Dimension | IT (Gartner) | VRSK (Verisk) |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Moat score** | 15/25 (WIDE, lower end) | 19/25 (WIDE, strong) |
| **Primary moat source** | Brand/intangibles + switching costs | Regulatory designation + data network effects |
| **Switching cost type** | "Soft" -- behavioral, cultural | "Hard" -- regulatory, technical, data |
| **AI vulnerability** | MEDIUM -- AI can partially substitute for basic research | LOW -- AI amplifies data advantage |
| **Client retention** | 84% | 92% |
| **ROIC** | 52.1% (higher, but partly buyback-driven) | 38.3% |
| **Revenue growth** | 9.8% CAGR (decelerating to ~2-4%) | 5.4% CAGR (stable) |
| **P/E (current)** | 15.9x (deeply discounted) | 27.5x |
| **Key risk** | AI commoditizing basic research | Growth ceiling in mature US P&C market |

**Assessment:** VRSK has a harder, more durable moat due to regulatory designation and "hard" switching costs. Gartner has a wider revenue base and higher ROIC but a "softer" moat that is more exposed to AI disruption. At 15.9x earnings (vs VRSK at 27.5x), the market is pricing Gartner's AI risk significantly more aggressively than Verisk's -- possibly too aggressively given that 82% of Gartner's revenue comes from subscription research that is NOT easily replaced by AI.

## AI Impact Assessment (Critical for Current Valuation)

The stock is down 70% from its high of $519, with a 31% single-day drop on Feb 3, 2026 after Q4 earnings. AI is the dominant narrative driver. My independent assessment:

**What AI CAN disrupt at Gartner:**
1. **Basic technology research queries:** "What is the best ERP software?" -- AI can answer this acceptably
2. **Consulting segment:** Project-based advisory work is vulnerable (9% of revenue, already declining)
3. **Lower-tier subscriptions:** Companies paying for basic research access may cancel if AI provides "good enough" answers

**What AI CANNOT (easily) disrupt at Gartner:**
1. **Analyst inquiry model:** A 30-minute call with a Gartner analyst who understands your company's specific context, IT architecture, budget constraints, and organizational politics -- this is not replicable by AI in the medium term
2. **Magic Quadrant authority:** An AI-generated "vendor ranking" does not carry the institutional weight of a Gartner Magic Quadrant in an enterprise procurement process. Procurement decisions are POLITICAL -- the CIO needs the "cover" of a Gartner endorsement
3. **Proprietary benchmarking data:** Gartner's databases of IT spending benchmarks, salary surveys, staffing ratios, and other comparative data are proprietary and not in AI training sets
4. **Conference networking:** Human connections at Gartner Symposium and similar events cannot be digitized
5. **Forward-looking strategic advisory:** Predicting which technologies will matter in 3-5 years requires judgment that AI does not yet reliably provide

**Per-seat pricing risk for Gartner specifically:**
Gartner charges ~$30K per seat. The buyers are typically CIOs, VPs, Directors, and senior IT managers. These roles are among the LAST to be automated by AI. Junior analysts who previously used Gartner are more at risk of headcount reduction -- but these are typically NOT the primary seat holders. The per-seat risk is therefore more moderate for Gartner than for, say, a developer tools SaaS company.

**Verdict: AI is a REAL but PARTIAL threat.** Unlike VRSK where AI is a clear tailwind, Gartner faces genuine headwinds from AI in its basic research and consulting segments. However, the market appears to be pricing Gartner as if AI will destroy the entire business (70% drawdown, 15.9x P/E), when the evidence suggests only the bottom ~20-30% of the value stack is truly at risk. The premium advisory/data/brand layer (70-80% of value) remains defensible.

---

## Discrepancias con Thesis (if applicable)

No fundamental-analyst thesis exists yet for IT. This moat assessment is being conducted independently as part of R1 research.

**Comparison with sector view:** The business-services.md sector view describes Gartner as "Priority: HIGH. Exceptional ROIC, massive selloff. Needs R1 to understand decline." My moat assessment adds nuance: the ROIC is exceptional but the moat is somewhat softer than peer VRSK due to AI vulnerability. The selloff is partly justified (weak guidance, DOGE) and partly overstated (AI disruption narrative for the core research business). The 15/25 moat score places Gartner at the lower end of WIDE, which combined with QS 73 (Tier B) and the massive selloff, makes this an interesting but not obvious opportunity -- the moat must be re-confirmed after understanding Q4 2025 dynamics more deeply.

## META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres
- **84% client retention vs 92% VRSK:** Gartner's 84% client retention rate is materially lower than VRSK's 92%. This is the single biggest gap in the moat thesis. Is 84% the structural level for an advisory business (where clients can more easily substitute) vs a data business (where switching costs are harder)? Or is 84% depressed by the current DOGE/AI environment and could recover? I was unable to find Gartner's retention rate trend over 5+ years to assess whether it is stable, improving, or declining.
- **Wallet retention drop to 96%:** The Q4 2025 GTS wallet retention of 96% (below 100% = shrinking wallet) is a red flag. If this persists, it suggests enterprises are REDUCING Gartner spend even while remaining clients. This could be early evidence of AI substitution at the margin. However, management attributes it primarily to DOGE and small tech vendor churn, with enterprise function leaders (GBS) still above 100%.
- **Consulting segment trajectory:** Consulting declined 12.8% in Q4 2025. Is this the beginning of a structural decline driven by AI? If so, could the negative narrative bleed into the perception of the core research business? Or is consulting cyclical and recoverable?
- **2026 guidance of 2% growth is extremely weak for a "quality compounder."** This is well below the historical 8-10% organic growth rate. Management expects acceleration through the year, but if it fails to materialize, the thesis that this is a cyclical trough (not structural decline) would be undermined.
- **Revenue per analyst metric:** I calculated ~$1.4M/analyst for Gartner vs ~$390K for Forrester, but these are rough estimates based on total analyst count vs total research revenue. The actual figures may differ based on how analysts are allocated across segments.
- **Magic Quadrant revenue attribution:** It is unclear what percentage of Gartner's research revenue is directly attributable to Magic Quadrant and similar evaluative research vs general advisory and data products. This matters because the moat thesis hinges heavily on Magic Quadrant's authority.

### Discrepancias con Thesis
- No thesis exists yet for comparison. This assessment is independent.
- **Potential discrepancy with quality_scorer.py:** The tool assigns QS 73 (Tier B), but with a proper market position score (which defaulted to 0/8 in the tool), Gartner would likely score 80+ (Tier A). Gartner is #1 in IT research/advisory with ~35-40% market share -- this should merit 7-8/8 on market position. A manual QS adjustment of +7 to +8 would push Gartner to 80-81 (Tier A). This needs orchestrator validation.

### Sugerencias para el Sistema
- **quality_scorer.py market position default of 0/8 continues to undercount.** For Gartner, a company with 35-40% market share and #1 position in its industry, getting 0/8 on market position is obviously wrong. This has been flagged before (VEEV, MORN assessments). The tool should at minimum flag when market position is defaulting to 0 so the analyst knows to input it manually.
- **AI disruption framework needed:** For information services companies (IT, VRSK, MORN, FDS, SPGI), we need a standardized framework to assess AI vulnerability that distinguishes between (a) data companies (where AI amplifies data moat), (b) analytics/advisory companies (where AI partially substitutes for human analysis), and (c) per-seat SaaS companies (where AI reduces seat count). Currently, the SaaSpocalypse narrative treats all three as equivalent, and our system should help us differentiate.
- **"Soft" vs "Hard" switching costs taxonomy:** The moat framework should explicitly distinguish between soft switching costs (behavioral, cultural, reputational -- like Gartner's) and hard switching costs (regulatory, technical integration, data migration -- like VRSK's). Soft switching costs are more durable than no switching costs but less durable than hard switching costs, especially when a credible substitute emerges.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator
1. **QS adjustment:** The tool gives 73 (Tier B) with 0/8 market position. Adjusted for market position (#1, ~35-40% share = 7-8 points), QS would be ~80-81 (Tier A). Should we validate this adjustment and proceed with Tier A classification?
2. **Moat WIDE vs NARROW debate:** I scored 15/25, which is the lower end of WIDE. The AI vulnerability creates genuine uncertainty about whether this moat will still be WIDE in 10 years. Should we classify as "WIDE with degradation risk" or "NARROW with upside"? The classification matters for entry price and MoS requirements.
3. **Comparison with VRSK:** VRSK at $179 (45% off highs) has a stronger moat (19/25) and higher QS (85 adj) than IT at $154 (70% off highs) with moat 15/25 and QS 73-80. Is the additional 25% selloff in Gartner justified by the weaker moat, or does it create a better risk-adjusted opportunity due to extreme pricing?
4. **Should we wait for Q1 2026 results?** Management guided for acceleration through 2026. The Q1 results (likely May 2026) will be the first test of whether this acceleration materializes. Given the uncertainty, should we set an entry price now or wait for Q1 confirmation?
5. **Per-seat pricing risk:** Gartner charges ~$30K/seat. If AI reduces the number of IT decision-makers at enterprises, Gartner's TAM shrinks. But AI also creates new buyer categories (AI/ML teams needing advisory). How should we weight these opposing forces in the fair value estimate?
