# B&M European Value Retail S.A. (BME.L) - Investment Thesis v2.0

**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Analyst:** Fundamental Analyst (Framework v2.0)
**Status:** CONDITIONAL BUY - Tier C
**Required MoS:** >=35%

---

## Executive Summary

B&M is the UK's largest variety discount retailer (~1,100 stores) trading at 174p, down ~50% from its 52-week high of 350p. The stock is priced at 7.0x trailing P/E with a 7.4% dividend yield.

**Core Question:** Is this a temporary earnings trough or structural impairment?

**Assessment:** The business model remains sound (direct China sourcing, ROIC >30% historically), but H1 FY26 showed 30% EBITDA decline. At 174p, the stock prices in permanent ~30% earnings decline, which appears too pessimistic for a structurally advantaged discount retailer. However, leverage is elevated and execution risk is real.

**Decision:** CONDITIONAL BUY if standing order trigger hit. Current trigger 169p may be too aggressive - recommend 165p for better MoS.

## PHASE 1: BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING (business-analysis-framework)

### 1.1 What Problem Does B&M Solve?

**Problem:** UK consumers (especially lower/middle income) need affordable household essentials, homewares, and groceries.

**Solution:** Variety discount retail - a "treasure hunt" shopping experience offering branded and private-label products at significantly below supermarket/high street prices.

**Customer Segment:** Lower/middle income UK households, bargain hunters, families on budgets.

**Must-have vs Nice-to-have:** MUST-HAVE. Core products are household essentials (cleaning, food, health/beauty). Discretionary items (garden, home decor) are "nice-to-have" but drive traffic.

### 1.2 Revenue Model

| Type | % Revenue | Characteristics |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| Transaction (retail) | 100% | Foot traffic driven, variable |
| B&M UK | ~75% | Core, 700+ stores |
| Heron Foods | ~10% | Convenience/grocery focus |
| B&M France | ~15% | Expansion market |

**Recurrence:** Low individual ticket but high visit frequency. Average customer visits 2-3x/month. NOT subscription, but habitual repeat purchase behavior.

### 1.3 Unit Economics (Store Level)

```
Average Store Revenue: ~GBP 5M/year (B&M UK avg)
  Source: GBP 3.5B UK revenue / 700 stores

Gross Margin per Store: ~35-37%
  = ~GBP 1.75-1.85M gross profit/store

Store Operating Costs: ~GBP 1.2-1.4M/year
  - Rent: ~GBP 200-300K
  - Labor: ~GBP 600-800K (15-20 FTEs)
  - Utilities, rates, other: ~GBP 300-400K

Store-Level EBITDA: ~GBP 350-550K/store
  = 7-11% of store revenue

New Store Payback: ~2-3 years
  Investment: ~GBP 500-700K (fit-out, inventory)
  EBITDA contribution: ~GBP 250-350K year 1 (ramp-up)
  = 2-3 year payback on new store

Store-level ROIC: ~50-70% (on incremental invested capital)
```

### 1.4 Margin Structure and Trend

| Metric | FY24 | FY25 | H1 FY26 | Trend |
|--------|------|------|---------|-------|
| Gross Margin | 37.2% | 36.5% | ~35% | COMPRESSING |
| EBITDA Margin (pre-IFRS16) | 11.5% | 10.8% | 7.7% | COMPRESSING |
| Net Margin | 6.5% | 5.5% | ~4% | COMPRESSING |

**Drivers of Margin Compression:**
1. UK National Insurance increases (+GBP 30-40M cost/year)
2. Shipping cost inflation (container rates 2-3x normal)
3. Competitive price investment (matching rivals)
4. Weak general merchandise demand (discretionary softness)

### 1.5 Capital Requirements

| Type | % Revenue | Trend |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Maintenance Capex | ~2% | Stable |
| Growth Capex | ~3% (45 stores/yr) | Stable |
| Working Capital | Negative (favorable) | B&M pays suppliers slower than inventory turns |

**Asset Intensity:** MEDIUM. Stores are leased (not owned), but inventory and distribution infrastructure require capital.

## PHASE 2: WHY IS IT CHEAP? (business-analysis-framework)

### 2.1 Market Narrative

The market believes:
- [X] Margins under structural pressure (NI, wages, shipping)
- [X] Consumer environment weak (even discounters struggling)
- [X] Competition intensifying (Action entering UK)
- [X] Guidance downgrades signal management losing control
- [X] Sector out-of-favor (retail generally hated)

### 2.2 My Contra-Thesis

| Market Believes | I Believe | My Evidence | Prob I'm Wrong |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Margin pressure is permanent | Margins will recover to ~9-10% (not 11%) | Cost inflation is cyclical; shipping normalizing; NI is one-time step-up now priced in | 35% |
| Consumer weakness hurts B&M equally | Discount retail gains share in downturns | Historical evidence: B&M grew through 2008-2009, 2020 | 25% |
| Action will disrupt UK market | Action's UK rollout will take 5+ years to scale | Action has 11,000 EU stores but <20 UK; retail expansion is slow | 20% |
| Business model impaired | Core sourcing advantage intact | Direct China sourcing, scale, ROIC >30% historically unchanged | 20% |

### 2.3 Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | Status | Comment |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Industry in secular decline | NO | Discount retail growing, not declining |
| Tech disruption imminent | NO | Physical retail, low tech exposure |
| Management destroying value | NO | New "Back to Basics" plan, reasonable strategy |
| Balance deteriorating | PARTIAL | Leverage above target but manageable |
| Insider selling >5% | NO | No major insider selling detected |
| Dividend cut recent/probable | PARTIAL | Special div cut, ordinary maintained |
| Market share loss >2pp | NO | B&M maintaining #1 position |
| ROIC < WACC 3 years | NO | ROIC still >30% historically |
| FCF negative >2 years | NO | FCF positive every year |
| Goodwill >50% equity | NO | Not acquisition-heavy |

**Value Trap Score: 2/10 (PARTIAL items count 0.5)** = PASS (need <3)

### 2.4 My Informational Edge

- [X] Longer time horizon: market focused on H1 FY26, not FY28 recovery
- [X] Behavioral overreaction: 50% drop in 12 months for 30% earnings decline seems excessive
- [ ] Better business understanding: Limited - this is well-covered stock
- [ ] Quantitative edge: Limited

**Honest Assessment:** Edge is primarily PATIENCE and BEHAVIORAL. I don't have unique information. The market may be right that margins stay depressed. My edge is willingness to wait 2-3 years for normalization.

---

## PHASE 3: PROJECTION (projection-framework)

### 3.1 TAM Analysis

**UK Discount/Value Retail Market:**
- Market size (2023): ~GBP 50-60B (variety goods + discount grocery)
- B&M addressable portion: ~GBP 30-35B (their categories)
- B&M market share: ~12% of addressable market
- Source: B&M investor presentations, industry reports

**TAM Growth Drivers:**
- (+) Trade-down in recession/cost-of-living crisis
- (+) Population growth (~0.5%/year)
- (+) Inflation in basket value
- (-) E-commerce shift (limited for discount retail)
- Net TAM Growth: ~2-3%/year

### 3.2 Market Share Analysis

| Year | B&M UK Revenue | Est Market Share |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| FY22 | GBP 3.1B | ~10% |
| FY23 | GBP 3.3B | ~11% |
| FY24 | GBP 3.4B | ~11.5% |
| FY25 | GBP 3.5B | ~12% |
| FY26E | GBP 3.6B | ~12% (flat) |

**Trend:** Share GAINING slowly (0.5pp/year historically), but H1 FY26 showed LFL flat, suggesting share gains stalling.

**Projection:** Assume share stable at ~12% for conservatism.

### 3.3 Pricing Power

- Historical pricing: B&M raises prices broadly in line with inflation
- Competitive positioning: EDLP (everyday low prices), not promotional
- Recent behavior: Price investment (lower margins) to defend traffic
- Score: MODERATE (can pass through inflation but not above)

**Pricing projection:** 2-3%/year (in line with CPI)

### 3.4 Revenue Projection Formula

```
Revenue Growth = TAM Growth + Delta Market Share + Pricing

Base Case:
  TAM Growth: +2%
  Market Share: +0% (conservatively flat)
  Pricing: +2%
  = Revenue Growth: ~4%/year

Bear Case:
  TAM Growth: +1%
  Market Share: -0.5% (share loss to Action)
  Pricing: +1%
  = Revenue Growth: ~1.5%/year

Bull Case:
  TAM Growth: +3%
  Market Share: +0.5%
  Pricing: +2.5%
  = Revenue Growth: ~6%/year
```

### 3.5 Margin Projection

**FY26 Guidance (current year):** EBITDA GBP 440-475M (midpoint 457M)
**FY25 Actual:** EBITDA GBP 620M

```
EBITDA Margin (pre-IFRS16):
  FY25: 10.8%
  FY26E: ~7.8% (guided)
  FY27E: 8.5% (partial recovery, NI absorbed)
  FY28E: 9.0% (shipping normalizes)
  FY29E: 9.5% (operational improvements)
  Normalized (FY30+): 9-10% (NOT returning to 11%)
```

**Why NOT 11%?** Cost structure permanently higher (NI, wages). But also NOT 7.7% - that's trough.

### 3.6 FCF Projection

**Historical FCF:**
- FY24: Cash from ops GBP 862M, FCF ~GBP 380-420M (after capex, interest, tax)
- FY25: Cash from ops GBP 784M, FCF ~GBP 330-370M

**FCF Conversion (FCF/EBITDA):**
- Historical: ~55-60%
- FY26E: ~50% (lower due to margin pressure)
- Normalized: ~55%

| Year | EBITDA | FCF Conv | FCF |
|------|--------|----------|-----|
| FY26E | 457M | 50% | 228M |
| FY27E | 510M | 52% | 265M |
| FY28E | 570M | 55% | 314M |
| FY29E | 610M | 55% | 336M |
| Terminal | 640M | 55% | 352M |

### 3.7 WACC Derivation

```
Cost of Equity (Ke):
  Risk-Free Rate (UK 10Y Gilt): 4.50%
  Equity Risk Premium: 5.0%
  Beta: 0.46 (source: Yahoo Finance)
  Ke = 4.50% + (0.46 * 5.0%) = 6.80%

  **Adjustment:** Beta 0.46 seems LOW for a stock down 50%.
  Using adjusted beta of 0.7 for conservatism:
  Ke = 4.50% + (0.7 * 5.0%) = 8.0%

Cost of Debt (Kd):
  Weighted avg cost: ~5.5% (mix of 3.5% 2028 bond and 8.125% 2030 bond)
  Tax rate: 25%
  Kd after-tax = 5.5% * (1 - 0.25) = 4.1%

Capital Structure:
  Market Cap: GBP 1.8B
  Net Debt (exc leases): GBP 0.86B
  Enterprise Value: GBP 2.66B
  E/V: 68%
  D/V: 32%

WACC = (68% * 8.0%) + (32% * 4.1%) = 5.44% + 1.31% = 6.75%

**Floor WACC:** 8% minimum for any equity (per investment-rules)

WACC Used: 8.0%
```

### 3.8 Terminal Growth

UK GDP growth: ~1.5-2%
B&M as mature retailer should not grow faster than economy
Terminal Growth: 2.0%

---

## PHASE 4: VALUATION (valuation-methods)

### Method Selection

B&M is a **cyclical retailer** currently in earnings trough.

Per valuation-methods skill:
- **Primary:** EV/EBIT Mid-Cycle
- **Secondary:** DCF with scenarios

### Method 1: EV/EBIT Mid-Cycle

**Step 1: Calculate Normalized EBIT**

| Year | EBIT (GBP M) |
|------|--------------|
| FY21 | 611 |
| FY22 | 535 |
| FY23 | 614 |
| FY24 | 571 |
| FY25 | 481 |
| **5-Year Avg** | **562** |

FY25 is depressed. Exclude and use FY21-24 average: 583M

**Adjustment:** FY21-22 included COVID boost. Normalized mid-cycle EBIT: **GBP 520-550M**

**Step 2: Determine Appropriate Multiple**

Retail sector EV/EBIT range: 6-10x

Adjustments for B&M:
- (+1x) Superior ROIC vs peers (>30%)
- (+0.5x) Market leader position
- (-1x) High leverage vs target
- (-0.5x) Turnaround execution risk
- Net adjustment: 0x

**Multiple: 8x (mid-range)**

**Step 3: Calculate Fair Value**

```
EV = Normalized EBIT * Multiple = 535M * 8x = GBP 4.28B
Less Net Debt: GBP 0.86B
Equity Value: GBP 3.42B
Shares: 1.0B
Fair Value per Share: 342p
```

### Method 2: DCF with Scenarios

**Bear Case (25% probability)**
```
Assumptions:
  - Revenue growth: 1.5%/year
  - EBITDA margin: 8% (no recovery)
  - Terminal FCF: GBP 240M
  - WACC: 9% (+1% for risk)
  - Terminal growth: 1.5%

Terminal Value = 240M / (9% - 1.5%) = 3.2B
PV of Terminal = 3.2B / (1.09)^5 = 2.08B
PV of FCF Years 1-5: ~0.95B
Enterprise Value: 3.03B
Less Net Debt: 0.86B
Equity Value: 2.17B
Per Share: 217p
```

**Base Case (50% probability)**
```
Assumptions:
  - Revenue growth: 4%/year
  - EBITDA margin: 9% recovery
  - Terminal FCF: GBP 352M
  - WACC: 8%
  - Terminal growth: 2%

Terminal Value = 352M / (8% - 2%) = 5.87B
PV of Terminal = 5.87B / (1.08)^5 = 4.0B
PV of FCF Years 1-5: ~1.1B
Enterprise Value: 5.1B
Less Net Debt: 0.86B
Equity Value: 4.24B
Per Share: 424p
```

**Bull Case (25% probability)**
```
Assumptions:
  - Revenue growth: 6%/year
  - EBITDA margin: 10% recovery
  - Terminal FCF: GBP 440M
  - WACC: 7%
  - Terminal growth: 2.5%

Terminal Value = 440M / (7% - 2.5%) = 9.78B
PV of Terminal = 9.78B / (1.07)^5 = 6.97B
PV of FCF Years 1-5: ~1.25B
Enterprise Value: 8.22B
Less Net Debt: 0.86B
Equity Value: 7.36B
Per Share: 736p
```

### Valuation Summary

| Method | Fair Value | Weight | Weighted FV |
|--------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| EV/EBIT Mid-Cycle | 342p | 50% | 171p |
| DCF Bear | 217p | 12.5% | 27p |
| DCF Base | 424p | 25% | 106p |
| DCF Bull | 736p | 12.5% | 92p |
| **Weighted Fair Value** | | 100% | **396p** |

**Conservative Fair Value (giving more weight to downside):**
- Bear-weighted: (217p * 30%) + (342p * 50%) + (424p * 20%) = 321p
- **Using 321p as Fair Value for MoS calculation (conservative)**

### Margin of Safety Calculation

```
Current Price: 174p
Conservative Fair Value: 321p
Margin of Safety: (321 - 174) / 321 = 46%

vs Bear Case Fair Value: 217p
MoS vs Bear: (217 - 174) / 217 = 20%
```

| vs | Fair Value | MoS |
|----|-----------|-----|
| Conservative Weighted | 321p | **46%** |
| Bear Case | 217p | 20% |
| EV/EBIT Mid-Cycle | 342p | 49% |
| DCF Base | 424p | 59% |

**Tier C requires >=35% MoS. At 174p, MoS is 46%. PASSES.**

---

## PHASE 5: RISK ASSESSMENT

### Risk Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Severity | Mitigant |
|------|------------|--------|----------|----------|
| UK consumer recession deepens | 35% | HIGH | HIGH | Discount retail relatively defensive |
| EBITDA misses even reduced guidance | 25% | HIGH | HIGH | Guidance already cut twice |
| Action gains UK traction rapidly | 15% | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | UK rollout takes years |
| Dividend cut (ordinary) | 25% | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | FCF covers ordinary div |
| China tariff escalation | 20% | HIGH | MEDIUM | Multi-sourcing, but China >50% GM |
| Debt refinancing at higher rates | 15% | MEDIUM | LOW | No maturity until 2028 |
| Management execution failure | 30% | HIGH | HIGH | "Back to Basics" unproven |

### Kill Conditions (Immediate Sell Triggers)

1. Net debt/EBITDA (pre-IFRS16) exceeds 2.5x
2. Ordinary dividend cut (signals FCF stress)
3. UK LFL sales negative 4 consecutive quarters with no margin recovery
4. CEO departure without clear succession
5. Action opens >100 UK stores within 2 years

### Gate 7: Autocritique
- [X] Listed below

---

## PHASE 7: AUTOCRITIQUE

### Assumptions Made
1. EBITDA margin recovers to 9% by FY28-29 (vs 7.7% H1 FY26)
2. No further guidance downgrades
3. Action's UK expansion remains slow
4. UK consumer environment doesn't deteriorate further
5. Ordinary dividend maintained

### Biases Detected
- **Value trap bias:** Low P/E is seductive. Am I being rational or drawn to cheapness?
- **Narrative bias:** "Discount retail wins in downturns" but B&M's numbers show the OPPOSITE
- **Anchoring:** 350p high makes 174p feel cheap, but maybe 174p is fair for impaired earnings

### Evidence Against This Thesis
1. H1 EBITDA down 30% - severe, not mild
2. Multiple analyst downgrades (Citi, Deutsche to Hold)
3. Even discount retail struggling in current environment
4. 8.125% bond refinancing was poorly timed, long-term drag
5. Leverage above management's own target

### Counter-Arguments
1. P/E 7x prices in permanent decline - but B&M still opening 45 stores/year
2. Cost pressures (NI, shipping) are external, not competitive loss
3. ROIC >30% historically shows business model works
4. Home Bargains (private competitor) grew 7.9% and profits jumped 13%
5. Discount retail has proven resilient across cycles

### Confidence Level
- Business model: HIGH confidence intact
- Margin recovery: MEDIUM confidence (to 9%, not 11%)
- Timeline: LOW confidence (could take 3+ years)

---

## DECISION AND RECOMMENDATION

### Status: CONDITIONAL BUY

**Fair Value:** 321p (conservative weighted)
**Current Price:** 174p
**Margin of Safety:** 46% (passes Tier C >=35%)

### Position Sizing
- Maximum position: 3% of AUM (reduced for small cap + Tier C)
- Entry in 2 tranches: 50% at trigger, 50% on H2 results confirmation

### Standing Order Recommendation

**Current Standing Order:** 169 GBp trigger
**Current Price:** 174 GBp (3% above trigger)

**Assessment of 169p trigger:**
- At 169p, MoS = (321-169)/321 = 47% - marginally better
- But 174p already offers 46% MoS
- Risk: waiting for 169p may miss entry if stock bounces

**Recommendation:**
- KEEP standing order at 169 GBp
- If price drops to 169, EXECUTE half position (1.5% AUM)
- Add second tranche on H2 results (Jun 2026) if margin recovery visible
- OR if price drops further to 155-160p, add second tranche earlier

### Price Targets
- **Entry:** 169-175p range
- **Fair Value (partial sell 25%):** 257p (80% of 321p)
- **Fair Value (sell 50%):** 321p
- **Bull Target (sell remainder):** 424p

### Stop-Loss
- **Hard stop:** 130p (-23% from 169p entry)
- At 130p, thesis is clearly failing (even bear case questions)

### Catalysts to Monitor
1. H2 FY26 results (Jun 2026) - margin stabilization?
2. UK consumer confidence data
3. Action's UK store count
4. Management commentary on "Back to Basics" progress

### Timeline
- Investment horizon: 24-36 months
- Key dates: Jun 2026 (FY26 results), Sep 2026 (H1 FY27)
