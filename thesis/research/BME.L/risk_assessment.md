## Top 3 Riesgos Criticos

### 1. TRIPLE LEADERSHIP VACUUM + ACCOUNTING ERROR

- **Categoria:** Financiero / Governance
- **Descripcion:** Between February 2025 and November 2025, B&M lost its CEO (Alex Russo departed Feb 2025), its CFO (Mike Schmidt departed Oct 2025 amid an accounting error), and its Group Trading Director (Gareth Bilton). The CFO departure was triggered by a GBP 7M freight cost accounting error that was "material" enough to revise guidance. An interim CFO (Helen Cowing) was appointed, and a new CEO (Tjeerd Jegen) started June 2025. The permanent CFO search is ongoing. Additionally, James Kew also departed. This means 4 senior leaders have left within ~9 months.
- **Evidencia:**
  - Bloomberg: "B&M Cuts Guidance Again on Missed Costs as CFO Steps Down" (Oct 20, 2025)
  - CFO Dive: "B&M reveals freight cost accounting error as CFO quits"
  - October guidance cut: GBP 510-560M --> GBP 470-520M (caused by GBP 7M freight error)
  - January guidance cut: GBP 470-520M --> GBP 440-475M (third cut in 6 months)
  - EY commissioned for third-party review of accounting processes
  - New CEO only 7 months into role; no permanent CFO yet
- **Probabilidad:** 4/5 (HIGH) -- This has already materialized. The risk is that new leadership cannot execute the turnaround, or further accounting issues surface from the EY review.
- **Impacto si materializa:** If the EY review finds systemic accounting issues, or if the new CEO's "Back to Basics" plan fails to stabilize margins within 12 months, the stock could decline another 20-30% to the 120-140p range. If a full restatement is required, impact could be 40%+.
- **Mitigante:** Jegen has relevant experience (CEO of HEMA, a Dutch variety discount chain). Insider buying: Chair Tiffany Hall bought GBP 201K in shares (Feb 2025); Jegen bought GBP 406K (Jun 2025). This signals some confidence.
- **Kill condition?** YES -- If EY review finds systemic accounting problems beyond the freight error, this should be an immediate EXIT trigger.

### 2. STRUCTURAL COST INFLATION: UK NI + MINIMUM WAGE (GBP 30M/yr)

- **Categoria:** Fundamental
- **Descripcion:** The UK National Insurance rate rose from 13.8% to 15% (April 2025), and the secondary threshold dropped from GBP 175K to GBP 5K per employee. Simultaneously, the minimum wage increased 6.73%. B&M quantified the combined impact at GBP 30M/yr before mitigation (GBP 26M B&M UK + GBP 4M Heron). This is NOT a one-time cost -- it is a permanent step-up in the cost base. On a pre-IFRS16 EBITDA of ~GBP 460M, GBP 30M represents a ~6.5% hit to earnings.
- **Evidencia:**
  - B&M H1 FY26 Results (Nov 13, 2025): "Overall impact of NMW and NI estimated at GBP 30M before mitigation"
  - HMRC estimates: GBP 23.8-25.7B additional annual revenue from NI changes economy-wide
  - B&M employs ~30,000+ people, heavily concentrated in minimum wage roles
  - EBITDA margin compressed from 10.4% (H1 FY25) to 7.0% (H1 FY26) -- 340bp decline
- **Probabilidad:** 5/5 (CERTAIN) -- This has already happened. The question is whether B&M can fully offset it.
- **Impacto si materializa:** If B&M cannot offset the full GBP 30M through pricing/efficiency, EBITDA margins may permanently settle at 7-8% rather than the thesis assumption of 9%. At 8% normalized margin on ~GBP 5.5B revenue, EBITDA = GBP 440M vs the thesis assumption of GBP 570M by FY28. This implies a fair value reduction of ~20%.
- **Mitigante:** Competitors face the same cost increases. B&M's direct sourcing model gives it margin buffer vs peers. Pricing pass-through is partial.
- **Kill condition?** NO, but this significantly reduces fair value. The thesis assumption of 9% margin recovery may be optimistic.

### 3. HERON FOODS STRUCTURAL IMPAIRMENT

- **Categoria:** Fundamental
- **Descripcion:** Heron Foods (10% of revenue, 344 stores) is in structural decline, not cyclical weakness. H1 FY26 EBITDA margin collapsed from 6.7% to 3.9% (-280bp). Revenue was down 0.9%. The Q3 update revealed that suppliers have reduced clearance stocklot availability, leaving Heron operating more like a higher-cost convenience discount model. This is not a temporary headwind -- the procurement model that made Heron work (cheap stocklots) may be permanently impaired. Management has placed Heron under "strategic review," which often precedes disposal or closure.
- **Evidencia:**
  - H1 FY26: Heron EBITDA GBP 11M, down 42% YoY (from GBP 18M)
  - Q3 FY26: Heron LFL -0.1%, described as "significant underperformance"
  - FY26 guidance cut partially attributed to "Heron Foods underperformance"
  - Heron was acquired for GBP 152M in 2017; current contribution suggests significant goodwill impairment risk
  - Strategic review language typically precedes disposal/write-down
- **Probabilidad:** 4/5 (HIGH) -- Heron's supplier model appears structurally broken.
- **Impacto si materializa:** If Heron is disposed of at a loss or requires material write-down, this could result in a GBP 50-100M one-off charge. The ongoing drag on group margins is ~50-80bp (Heron's low margins pull down the group average). Disposal would actually improve group margins but crystallize a capital loss.
- **Mitigante:** Disposal at any price removes the drag. B&M's core UK business (786 stores) operates independently and is unaffected by Heron.
- **Kill condition?** NO individually, but combined with other risks, it matters.

## Riesgos NO Mencionados en Thesis

| Riesgo | Severidad | Mencionado en thesis? | Comentario |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|------------|
| **Accounting error + 3rd-party EY review** | CRITICAL | NO | Thesis dated Feb 3 does not mention the Oct 20 freight accounting error or the EY review. This is a governance red flag the thesis completely missed. |
| **CFO departure linked to accounting issue** | HIGH | NO | Thesis mentions "management execution failure" generically but does NOT mention that the CFO was forced out by an accounting error. |
| **Triple leadership vacuum (4 senior departures in 9 months)** | HIGH | NO | Thesis mentions "CEO departure" as kill condition but does not acknowledge that CEO+CFO+Trading Dir+James Kew ALL left. The scale of the exodus is not captured. |
| **Heron Foods structural impairment (stocklot model broken)** | HIGH | NO | Thesis does not mention Heron at all. It treats B&M as a single entity. Heron's structural model breakdown is absent. |
| **3 successive guidance cuts in 6 months** | HIGH | Minimizado | Thesis mentions "EBITDA misses even reduced guidance" as a risk at 25% probability. In reality, guidance was cut 3 times: (1) Oct: 510-560 to 470-520, (2) Nov: maintained, (3) Jan: 470-520 to 440-475. The pattern of serial misses is more severe than the thesis suggests. |
| **GBP 30M/yr NI+NMW quantified impact** | MEDIUM | Minimizado | Thesis lists "UK NI increases" but does not quantify the GBP 30M impact or note it represents 6.5% of EBITDA. |
| **Wilko 51 stores underperforming** | MEDIUM | NO | Thesis does not mention the Wilko store acquisitions or their below-average productivity. |
| **CFO search still ongoing (interim CFO in place)** | MEDIUM | NO | As of Feb 2026, B&M still has no permanent CFO. |
| **IFRS16 total leverage 2.9x (not just 1.7x ex-leases)** | MEDIUM | Minimizado | Thesis cites 1.7x pre-IFRS16 but does not mention that including leases, leverage is 2.9x. Total lease liabilities are GBP 1.46B. |
| **Action has 3,302 stores and opens 384/yr but NOT in UK** | LOW (positive) | Overestimado | Thesis lists Action competition at 15% probability. In reality, Action does NOT have UK stores and has not announced UK entry. The thesis overstates this near-term risk. |

## Kill Conditions Sugeridas

Based on my findings, I recommend adding these kill conditions to the thesis:

1. **EY review finds systemic accounting issues** beyond the GBP 7M freight error --> IMMEDIATE EXIT. Accounting integrity is foundational.

2. **No permanent CFO appointed by FY26 results (Jun 2026)** --> Strong signal of governance dysfunction if they cannot fill the role in 8+ months.

3. **FY26 actual EBITDA below GBP 440M** (bottom of already-cut guidance) --> Would represent 4th guidance miss and destroys credibility of any recovery projections.

4. **Ordinary dividend cut** --> The thesis already has this, and it remains valid. The interim was cut 34% to 3.5p; if the final is also cut or eliminated, FCF stress is confirmed.

5. **Heron Foods disposal at >50% loss on GBP 152M acquisition price** --> Would crystallize capital destruction and signal management admitted a GBP 75M+ mistake.

## Riesgo Agregado

- **Number of HIGH+CRITICAL risks:** 7 (2 CRITICAL + 5 HIGH)
- **Riesgos correlacionados?** YES -- Risks #1 (leadership), #2 (costs), #3 (Heron), and #7 (turnaround execution) are deeply correlated. The turnaround depends on new leadership executing cost mitigation and margin recovery, which is harder with no permanent CFO, a broken Heron subsidiary, and a GBP 30M structural cost headwind. These risks COMPOUND each other.
- **Risk Score Final: HIGH**

### Rationale for HIGH (not VERY HIGH):
Despite 2 CRITICAL risks, I rate the overall score as HIGH rather than VERY HIGH because:
1. Insider buying is meaningful (GBP 600K+ from Chair and CEO)
2. The core B&M UK business model (786 stores, direct China sourcing, ROIC >30%) remains structurally sound
3. Net debt pre-IFRS16 at 1.6x is elevated but not distressed
4. No near-term debt maturity (first bond matures 2028)
5. Shipping costs are normalizing (Red Sea reopening likely in 2026, freight rates down 25% YoY)

However, if the EY review surfaces further issues, this would escalate to VERY HIGH immediately.

## Fair Value Impact Assessment

The thesis fair value of 321p assumes:
- EBITDA margin recovery to 9% by FY28
- Revenue growth 4%/yr
- 8x EV/EBIT mid-cycle multiple

My adversarial adjustments:

| Thesis Assumption | My Adjustment | Reasoning |
|-------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Margin recovery to 9% | 7.5-8.5% more realistic | GBP 30M NI cost is permanent; Heron drags group margin; Wilko stores underperform |
| Revenue growth 4%/yr | 3-4% (lower end) | UK LFL was -0.6% in Q3 before Dec recovery; France growing but sub-scale |
| Net debt GBP 859M | Correct but IFRS16 adds GBP 1.46B in lease liabilities | Total debt burden is GBP 2.48B, not GBP 859M |
| Normalized mid-cycle EBIT GBP 535M | GBP 380-450M more realistic | Margins structurally lower, Heron drag, NI headwind |
| 8x EV/EBIT multiple | 6-7x warranted | Governance concerns (accounting error, leadership churn) deserve discount |

**Adversarial Fair Value Estimate:**
- Mid-cycle EBIT: GBP 415M (midpoint of 380-450)
- Multiple: 6.5x (discount for governance + turnaround risk)
- EV: GBP 2,698M
- Less net debt: GBP 859M
- Equity value: GBP 1,839M
- Per share: ~184p

**vs Thesis: 321p --> 184p = -43% reduction**

At 174p current price, MoS vs my adversarial FV is only 5%. This is NOT sufficient for a Tier C special situation.

The thesis bear case of 217p also appears optimistic. My bear case:
- EBIT: GBP 340M (margin stays at 7-8%)
- Multiple: 5.5x
- EV: GBP 1,870M
- Less net debt: GBP 859M
- Equity: GBP 1,011M
- Per share: ~101p (42% downside from current)

## META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres
1. **EY review outcome unknown.** The review was commissioned in October 2025 and was expected "in coming weeks" as of November. I could not find the published results. If the review found nothing beyond the GBP 7M error, the governance risk diminishes significantly. If it found more, the risk escalates. This is the single biggest unknown.
2. **Heron Foods strategic review status.** The thesis does not mention this and I could not find a definitive outcome. If Heron is sold or wound down, it actually improves the core business metrics. If it continues to drag, it erodes group margins.
3. **Q4 FY26 trading.** December saw +3% LFL in UK and "similar trends in early January." If this continues through March, it would support the case for cyclical (not structural) weakness. But Q3 overall was still negative LFL.
4. **Action UK entry timing.** Action has 3,302 European stores, opens 384/year, but is NOT yet in the UK. The thesis treats this as a 15% probability risk. The actual timing is uncertain but could be 2-5 years away.

### Riesgos que Podrian Estar Subestimados
1. **Accounting error severity.** I rated this CRITICAL but it could be VERY HIGH if the EY review found systemic issues. The fact that the CFO departed over a "mere" GBP 7M error suggests either (a) the error was more embarrassing than material, or (b) there were deeper issues. The speed of departure and the need for a third-party review is concerning.
2. **Leadership churn.** 4 senior departures in 9 months is extreme for a GBP 1.7B company. Institutional knowledge loss is real. The new CEO is 7 months in with no permanent CFO. This is underappreciated by the thesis.
3. **Margin recovery timing.** The thesis assumes 9% EBITDA margin by FY28. With GBP 30M in permanent cost uplift, Heron dragging, and the "Back to Basics" plan still in pilot phase, 8% may be a more realistic ceiling. Even 50bp lower margin = GBP 25M less EBITDA = ~25p less fair value.

### Discrepancias con Thesis
1. **Thesis FV 321p vs my adversarial FV 184p** -- 43% gap. The thesis uses normalized EBIT of GBP 535M and 8x multiple. I believe GBP 415M and 6.5x is more realistic given governance, costs, and turnaround uncertainty.
2. **Thesis does not mention the accounting error, CFO departure, or Heron strategic review.** These are material events that occurred between the thesis date (Feb 3) and the data available. However, the thesis should have known about the October 2025 events.
3. **Thesis treats "management execution failure" as 30% probability.** With 4 senior departures, an accounting error, and 3 guidance cuts, this risk has PARTIALLY MATERIALIZED, not merely a probability.
4. **Thesis does not quantify the NI impact at GBP 30M.** This is a major omission.

### Sugerencias para el Sistema
1. **Standing order at 169p should be reconsidered.** My adversarial FV of 184p implies only 8% MoS at 169p. For a Tier C with this many governance red flags, MoS should be much higher. Suggest revising entry to 130-140p range (which would give 25-30% MoS vs adversarial FV).
2. **Thesis needs v3.0 update** incorporating the accounting error, CFO departure, revised guidance, Heron strategic review, and quantified NI impact. The current thesis is materially stale on several risk factors.
3. **Add "accounting integrity" as a standard check** in the fundamental-analyst workflow. The existing thesis did not detect or mention the freight cost accounting error despite it being public information since October 2025.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator
1. Has the EY review of B&M's accounting been published? This is the single most important unknown for the risk profile.
2. Should we lower the standing order trigger from 169p to the 130-140p range given the adversarial fair value of 184p?
3. Given 7 HIGH+CRITICAL risks and a 43% gap between thesis FV and adversarial FV, should this standing order be suspended entirely until we have EY review results and Q4 trading data?
