## POSITION-BY-POSITION ANALYSIS

### 1. ADBE — Adobe Inc. | Tier A (QS 76 Tool / 73 Adj)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price | $257.34 (EUR 216.32) |
| FV (thesis v2.0) | $390 (FTC-adjusted weighted) |
| MoS | 34.0% |
| P&L | -$26.08 (-4.8%) |
| Alloc | 4.3% |
| Thesis Age | 2026-02-10 (1 day) — FRESH |
| Conviction | MEDIUM |

**Kill Conditions Status:** 0/8 triggered. ROIC 30% >> WACC 12%. Churn <10%. FCF $9.8B positive. No mass insider selling. FTC trial Oct 19, 2026 — distant.

**Catalyst Proximity:** Q1 FY26 earnings Mar 2026. FTC trial Oct 2026.

**Performance vs Thesis:** Price declined from $270.60 entry to $257.34 (-4.8%). Still within base case range. MoS has IMPROVED from 31.6% at purchase to 34.0%. Thesis fundamentally intact. The price is near 52w low ($255.71) — market pessimism maximum.

**Verdict: HOLD MEDIUM. Thesis intact. MoS improving. No action needed.**

### 2. MONY.L — Mony Group | Tier A (QS 81)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price | 150.60 GBp (EUR 1.73) |
| FV (adversarial) | 201 GBp |
| MoS | 25.1% |
| P&L | -$54.19 (-11.5%) |
| Alloc | 3.5% |
| Thesis Age | 2026-02-07 (4 days) — FRESH |
| Conviction | LOW |

**Kill Conditions Status:** 0/8 triggered. ROIC 29% >> WACC 9%. No revenue decline >5% confirmed. No dividend cut. Traffic data not updated.

**Catalyst Proximity:** **FY2025 RESULTS FEB 23 (12 DAYS)** — CRITICAL. Earnings framework ready. Bull: revenue >£450M + AI monetization. Bear: revenue <£435M or insurance -5%.

**Performance vs Thesis:** Worst performer at -11.5%. Price fell from 232p entry zone to 150.6p. Adversarial review already reduced FV from 277→201 GBp. At 150.6p, MoS vs adversarial FV is 25.1%. Motor insurance premiums -9% H1 2025 and traffic decline 8.82% MoM (Nov 2025) flagged in adversarial review — these are real headwinds.

**Verdict: HOLD LOW through Feb 23 earnings. Post-earnings decision MANDATORY per framework.**

### 3. LULU — Lululemon Athletica | Tier A (QS 82)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price | $179.43 (EUR 150.83) |
| FV (thesis) | $261 (weighted DCF + P/E) |
| MoS | 31.3% |
| P&L | +$14.24 (+4.1%) |
| Alloc | 3.0% |
| Thesis Age | 2026-02-05 (6 days) — FRESH |
| Conviction | MEDIUM (no adversarial review yet) |

**Kill Conditions Status:** 0/7 triggered. GM 58.5% > 50% threshold. No 3 consecutive negative global comps. FCF positive. CEO search ongoing (no bad appointment).

**Catalyst Proximity:** Q4 FY26 earnings expected Mar 2026. New CEO announcement pending.

**Performance vs Thesis:** +4.1% since entry at $171.62. Thesis cited product refresh (35% newness Spring 2026) as key catalyst — this is imminent. International continues strong (China +46%). Price bounced from 52w low of $159.25. MoS 31.3% vs weighted FV.

**NOTE:** Adversarial review PENDING (deferred from Fase 5). Thesis FV may be inflated per pattern of 12/13 positions averaging -15% post-adversarial. Expected adjusted FV: ~$220-230.

**Verdict: HOLD MEDIUM. Pending adversarial review. Fundamentals tracking expectations.**

### 4. AUTO.L — AutoTrader Group | Tier A (QS 79)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price | 471.80 GBp (EUR 5.41) |
| FV (thesis) | 688 GBp (weighted OEY + EV/EBIT peers) |
| MoS | 31.4% |
| P&L | -$9.89 (-2.3%) |
| Alloc | 3.5% |
| Thesis Age | 2026-02-06 (5 days) — FRESH |
| Conviction | MEDIUM (no adversarial review yet) |

**Kill Conditions Status:** 0/7 triggered. Dealer count stable (165 cancellations = 1.2% of 13,500). ARPR grew 5% H1 2026. No competitor >20% share. FCF margin ~50%.

**Catalyst Proximity:** FY2026 results expected May 2026 (distant).

**Performance vs Thesis:** -2.3% since entry. Price near 52w low (468.6p). Thesis is that Deal Builder dealer revolt is cyclical, not structural. ARPR still grew 5% despite controversy — thesis tracking.

**NOTE:** Adversarial review PENDING. Expected adjusted FV: ~$580-620 GBp per -15% average pattern.

**Verdict: HOLD MEDIUM. Near 52w low = attractive. Pending adversarial review.**

### 5. BYIT.L — Bytes Technology Group | Tier A (QS 81)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price | 291.60 GBp (EUR 3.34) |
| FV (thesis) | 455 GBp (weighted OEY + DCF) |
| MoS | 35.9% |
| P&L | -$5.59 (-1.3%) |
| Alloc | 3.7% |
| Thesis Age | 2026-02-07 (4 days) — FRESH |
| Conviction | MEDIUM (no adversarial review yet) |

**Kill Conditions Status:** 0/7 triggered. Microsoft partner status intact. FCF positive. Services +40% growth. No major customer loss. QS 81 > 75 threshold.

**Catalyst Proximity:** H2 FY2026 results expected ~May 2026 (distant). Microsoft FY26 incentive changes ongoing.

**Performance vs Thesis:** -1.3% since entry. Price near 52w low (290.8p). Microsoft incentive transition is the key uncertainty — thesis argues this is cyclical, services growth is filling the gap.

**NOTE:** Adversarial review PENDING. Expected adjusted FV: ~$385-410 GBp per -15% average pattern.

**Verdict: HOLD MEDIUM. MoS 35.9% is strong. Pending adversarial review.**

### 6. NVO — Novo Nordisk | Tier B (QS 73 Tool, was 82 thesis)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price | $48.35 (EUR 40.64) |
| FV (thesis) | DKK 491 → $65.61 (via DKK/USD) |
| MoS | ~26.3% |
| P&L | +$2.08 (+0.5%) |
| Alloc | 3.4% |
| Thesis Age | 2026-02-04 (7 days) — RECENT |
| Conviction | MEDIUM |

**Kill Conditions Status:** 0/7 triggered. CagriSema head-to-head data still pending (March 2026). Market share at 49% (above 40% kill). GM ~76% (above 70% kill). No dividend cut. ROIC 22% >> WACC 7%.

**Catalyst Proximity:** **CagriSema vs Zepbound head-to-head data MARCH 2026** — thesis-defining event. Could move stock +/-20%.

**Performance vs Thesis:** +0.5% since entry at $48.13. Essentially flat. Thesis was purchased at "distressed valuation" with P/E 13x vs historical 25-35x. Adversarial review adjusted QS from 82→73 (Tier A→B). The core catalyst (CagriSema data) is ~1 month away.

**Verdict: HOLD MEDIUM. CagriSema data in ~1 month will be decisive.**

---

### 7. EDEN.PA — Edenred | Tier B (QS 62)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price | EUR 17.86 |
| FV (adversarial) | EUR 29.00 |
| MoS | 38.4% |
| P&L | +$7.72 (+1.7%) |
| Alloc | 3.9% |
| Thesis Age | 2026-02-07 (4 days) — FRESH |
| Conviction | MEDIUM |

**Kill Conditions Status:** 0/12 triggered. France has not imposed caps (KC#1). ND/EBITDA ~2.3x < 3.0x (KC#2). FCF conversion >65% (KC#3). No dividend cut (KC#4). 2027-28 guidance maintained +8/+12% (KC#6). Brazil injunction active (KC#7 monitoring).

**Catalyst Proximity:** **FY2025 RESULTS FEB 24 (13 DAYS)** — CRITICAL. Earnings framework ready. Decision tree defined: 2027-28 guidance maintained = HOLD. Guidance <5% = EXIT.

**Performance vs Thesis:** +1.7% since entry at EUR 20.87. Price near 52w low (EUR 16.96). Forward return ranking shows +115.2% MoS — highest in portfolio. The adversarial review cut FV from 38.4→29.0 but at EUR 17.86, even the adversarial FV gives 38.4% MoS.

**Verdict: HOLD MEDIUM through Feb 24 earnings. Decision tree ready.**

---

### 8. DOM.L — Domino's Pizza Group | Tier B (QS 61)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price | 195.90 GBp (EUR 2.25) |
| FV (adversarial v3.0) | 240 GBp |
| MoS | 18.4% |
| P&L | +$31.13 (+7.1%) |
| Alloc | 3.9% |
| Thesis Age | 2026-02-10 (1 day) — FRESH |
| Conviction | LOW |

**Kill Conditions Status:** No explicit kill conditions in thesis v3.0. Key monitors: FY25 EBITDA (consensus £133M), FCF conversion (fell from 85→43-52%), store openings (slowed to mid-twenties).

**Catalyst Proximity:** **FY2025 RESULTS MAR 5 (22 DAYS)**. New CEO Dominic Paul starts Apr 6.

**Performance vs Thesis:** Best P&L at +7.1%. Price recovered from low ~164p to 195.9p. MoS 18.4% is BELOW Tier B typical 20-25% — marginal. New CEO (ex-Costa Coffee, led £3.9B sale) is a positive catalyst but unproven.

**Verdict: HOLD LOW through Mar 5 results. MoS marginal for Tier B.**

---

### 9. ALL — Allstate Corp | Tier C (QS 56)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price | $200.25 (EUR 168.33) |
| FV (adversarial) | $234 (independent), $214 (risk-adj) |
| MoS | 6.2% (risk-adj) / 14.4% (independent) |
| P&L | +$8.68 (+2.2%) |
| Alloc | 3.4% |
| Thesis Age | 2026-02-08 (3 days) — FRESH |
| Conviction | LOW — ON PROBATION |

**Kill Conditions Status:** Peak cycle confirmed. ROE 37% normalizes to 15-18%. Combined ratio 85.2% vs 10yr avg ~97%. Arity/data privacy litigation (TX AG + class actions) = MATERIAL undisclosed risk. Senate claims fraud hearing = additional pressure.

**Catalyst Proximity:** Q1 2026 earnings expected ~Apr/May 2026. No near-term catalyst.

**Performance vs Thesis:** +2.2%. MoS is THIN (6.2% risk-adjusted). This is the weakest MoS position in portfolio. Peak cycle + structural risks (Arity litigation, Progressive gaining share 17% vs ALL 10.2%).

**Verdict: ON PROBATION LOW. Position $400 = tiny. Q1 2026 earnings is decision point. SELL if Tier A needs capital.**

---

### 10. VICI — VICI Properties | Tier C (QS 54 Tool, ~60 REIT-adj)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price | $29.38 (EUR 24.70) |
| FV (v3.0) | $29.00 |
| MoS | **-1.3%** (OVERVALUED vs FV) |
| P&L | +$17.75 (+3.0%) |
| Alloc | 5.2% |
| Thesis Age | 2026-02-10 (1 day) — FRESH |
| Conviction | LOW — ON PROBATION |

**Kill Conditions Status:** Caesars Regional rent coverage 1.03x = CRITICAL (25% of NOI). LV visitors DOWN 7-9% YoY (thesis claimed 42M+ record). 3 analyst downgrades (Evercore, WFC, Scotia).

**Catalyst Proximity:** **EARNINGS FEB 25 (14 DAYS)** — decisive. AFFO guidance is key. KC#7: rent cut >10% without compensation = EXIT.

**Performance vs Thesis:** +3.0% P&L but price $29.38 is ABOVE FV $29.00. MoS is NEGATIVE. This position is technically overvalued by its own thesis. Largest allocation at 5.2% despite lowest conviction.

**Verdict: ON PROBATION. OVERVALUED vs FV. Feb 25 earnings decisive. Post-earnings SELL/HOLD/UPGRADE mandatory.**

### 11. GL — Globe Life | Tier C (QS 52 Tool, 55 Adj)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price | $142.12 (EUR 119.47) |
| FV (v3.0) | $191 |
| MoS | 25.6% |
| P&L | +$3.18 (+0.8%) |
| Alloc | 3.6% |
| Thesis Age | 2026-02-10 (1 day) — FRESH |
| Conviction | MEDIUM-LOW |

**Kill Conditions Status:** 0 triggered. SEC + DOJ CLEARED (Jul 2025). ROE 20.9% > 12% floor. FY26 guidance $14.95-$15.65 EPS (+5%). 4 class actions still pending but SEC/DOJ clearance is major positive.

**Catalyst Proximity:** No near-term earnings. Next major event: class action resolutions (2026-2027).

**Performance vs Thesis:** +0.8%. GL was the sole anomaly in adversarial review — thesis FV was too CONSERVATIVE (adversarial raised FV from $174→$185, v3.0 now $191). SEC/DOJ clearance removes biggest overhang. MoS 25.6% is adequate.

**Verdict: HOLD MEDIUM-LOW. Thesis improving. SEC clearance is material positive. Class actions are remaining overhang.**

### 12. UHS — Universal Health Services | Tier C (QS 51)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price | $217.54 (EUR 182.86) |
| FV (v3.0) | $213 |
| MoS | **-2.1%** (OVERVALUED vs FV) |
| P&L | +$32.24 (+8.0%) |
| Alloc | 3.7% |
| Thesis Age | 2026-02-10 (1 day) — FRESH |
| Conviction | LOW — ON PROBATION |

**Kill Conditions Status:** Medicaid cuts NOW LAW (OBBBA Jul 2025) — $360-400M revenue loss by 2032. DOJ $122M + 5yr OIG oversight. Behavioral health volumes soft (+0.4-0.5% vs thesis 7-9% CAGR). ROIC spread +1.2pp — barely above WACC.

**Catalyst Proximity:** **EARNINGS FEB 25-26 (14-15 DAYS)** — decisive. FY2025 EPS vs $21.80 consensus. Behavioral health volumes key. Medicaid impact disclosure.

**Performance vs Thesis:** Best absolute P&L at +8.0% ($32.24) but price $217.54 is ABOVE FV $213. MoS is NEGATIVE (-2.1%). Like VICI, this position is overvalued by its own thesis.

**Verdict: ON PROBATION LOW. OVERVALUED vs FV. Feb 25 earnings SELL/HOLD mandatory. Structural Medicaid risk.**

### 13. DTE.DE — Deutsche Telekom | Tier C (QS 48)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price | EUR 30.52 |
| FV (v3.1) | EUR 35.00 |
| MoS | 12.8% |
| P&L | +$49.27 (+7.0%) |
| Alloc | 6.3% |
| Thesis Age | 2026-02-11 (TODAY) — FRESH |
| Conviction | MEDIUM |

**Kill Conditions Status:** 0 triggered. TMUS Q4 beat confirmed. FY2026 EBITDA guide $37-37.5B (+10%). Revenue CAGR 1.8% is sluggish but TMUS compensates. ROIC spread -0.7pp is concerning (value creation issue).

**Catalyst Proximity:** **DTE FY2025 EARNINGS FEB 26 (15 DAYS)**. Pre-earnings framework ready. EPS EUR 2.50 guidance for 2026.

**Performance vs Thesis:** Best P&L% after DOM.L at +7.0%. FV just upgraded from EUR 34→35 post-TMUS beat. MoS 12.8% is thin for Tier C (should be 30-40%). This is the largest position at 6.3% — oversized for its quality tier.

**Verdict: HOLD MEDIUM through Feb 26. TRIM trigger at EUR 34. Position oversized for Tier C quality.**

## PORTFOLIO HEALTH METRICS

### P&L by Position (sorted best to worst)
| Ticker | P&L $ | P&L % | Tier |
|--------|-------|-------|------|
| DTE.DE | +$49.27 | +7.0% | C |
| DOM.L | +$31.13 | +7.1% | B |
| UHS | +$32.24 | +8.0% | C |
| VICI | +$17.75 | +3.0% | C |
| LULU | +$14.24 | +4.1% | A |
| ALL | +$8.68 | +2.2% | C |
| EDEN.PA | +$7.72 | +1.7% | B |
| GL | +$3.18 | +0.8% | C |
| NVO | +$2.08 | +0.5% | B |
| BYIT.L | -$5.59 | -1.3% | A |
| AUTO.L | -$9.89 | -2.3% | A |
| ADBE | -$26.08 | -4.8% | A |
| MONY.L | -$54.19 | -11.5% | A |

**Pattern:** Tier C positions (DTE, UHS, VICI, ALL) are the best performers. Tier A positions (MONY.L, ADBE, AUTO.L, BYIT.L) are the worst. This is INVERSE of what quality-first would predict — likely mean-reversion lag (Tier C bought earlier, benefiting from insurance hard market / rate cuts; Tier A bought near lows, still finding floors).

### MoS Distribution (Current Price vs Working FV)
| Range | Count | Tickers |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Negative (overvalued) | 2 | VICI (-1.3%), UHS (-2.1%) |
| 0-15% (thin) | 3 | ALL (6.2%), DTE.DE (12.8%), DOM.L (18.4%) |
| 15-30% (adequate) | 4 | MONY.L (25.1%), GL (25.6%), NVO (26.3%), AUTO.L (31.4%) |
| 30%+ (strong) | 4 | LULU (31.3%), ADBE (34.0%), BYIT.L (35.9%), EDEN.PA (38.4%) |

### Quality Gravity Check (Principio 9)
| Metric | Current |
|--------|---------|
| Tier A invested | $2,147 (35% of invested) |
| Tier B invested | $1,353 (22% of invested) |
| Tier C invested | $2,620 (43% of invested) |
| Cash | EUR 4,844 (48.5% of total) |

**Assessment:** Tier C is the LARGEST allocation category. This is INVERSE of the All-Tier-A strategic direction. Cash at 48.5% is very high — post-adversarial review capital preservation. Priority should be deploying cash into Tier A candidates from the opportunity scan, not adding to Tier C.

## RECOMMENDATIONS SUMMARY

| Priority | Action | Ticker | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|--------|-----------|
| **URGENT** | Prepare for earnings week Feb 23-26 | MONY.L, EDEN.PA, VICI, UHS, DTE.DE | 5 positions reporting. Decision frameworks ready. |
| **HIGH** | Monitor VICI + UHS overvaluation | VICI, UHS | Both above FV. Earnings will determine SELL/HOLD. |
| **MEDIUM** | Complete adversarial reviews | LULU, AUTO.L, BYIT.L | Pattern suggests -15% FV adjustment expected. |
| **MEDIUM** | Deploy cash into Tier A pipeline | PAYC, DSY.PA, RMV.L, MORN | 48.5% cash is excessive. Screening identified 4 Tier A candidates. |
| **LOW** | Evaluate ALL exit | ALL | Weakest MoS (6.2%), peak cycle, Arity litigation. SELL if Tier A deployment needs capital. |
