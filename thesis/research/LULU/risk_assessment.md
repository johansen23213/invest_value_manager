## QS Reassessment (Adversarial -- UPDATED)

The QS tool scores LULU at **80/100 Tier A** (legacy). The thesis claims 82/100. Here is what the tool misses or overstates:

### Financial Quality (Tool: 35/40 -- Adversarial: 27-30/40)

1. **ROIC spread +37.1pp is BACKWARD-LOOKING.** The tool's trailing 4-year ROIC trajectory (44.1% -> 37.4% -> 48.9% -> 46.7%) reflects the peak period when US comps were positive. With Americas revenue declining 2% and comps -5%, and $320M+ in tariff costs, forward ROIC will compress materially. Adjusted forward ROIC spread: 20-25pp (still excellent, but the trajectory is DOWN).
   - Score adjustment: 12-13/15 (not 15/15)

2. **FCF Margin 15% under threat.** FY2026 will see $320M minimum in tariff-driven margin compression (on ~$10.5-11B revenue = ~300bp). With operating margin already compressed to 18.5% in Q1 FY2026 (from 23.7% trailing), FCF margin could drop to 10-12%.
   - Score adjustment: 3-4/10 (not 5/10)

3. **Leverage 0.2x is misleading.** Net debt $727M looks benign, but operating lease obligations total $1.575B. As a retailer with 700+ stores, the real leverage picture is more like 1.3-1.5x including leases.
   - Score adjustment: 8/10 (not 10/10)

4. **Net adjustment: -5 to -8 points** (27-30/40 vs 35/40)

### Growth Quality (Tool: 25/25 -- Adversarial: 17-20/25)

1. **Revenue CAGR 19.2% is historical peak.** Forward reality: Americas (70% of revenue) declining. FY2025 guidance was CUT. "Power of Three x2" $12.5B target will be missed. Forward revenue growth is 4-7%, not 19%.
   - Score adjustment: 4-5/10 (not 10/10)

2. **EPS CAGR 25% is historical peak.** With $320M tariff headwind and operating margin compression, FY2026 EPS is expected FLAT to slightly down. Needham expects mid-single-digit EPS decline.
   - Score adjustment: 4-6/10 (not 10/10)

3. **GM Trend "Expanding" will reverse.** GM was 59.2% trailing, but tariffs (Vietnam 46%, Cambodia 49%) will compress this. Management REFUSED to give FY2026 margin guidance.
   - Score adjustment: 3-4/5 (not 5/5)

4. **Net adjustment: -5 to -8 points** (17-20/25 vs 25/25)

### Moat Evidence (Tool: 17/25 -- Adversarial: 14-17/25)

1. **GM Premium +24.2pp is the strongest signal.** Real and significant. However, DTC market share dropped from 30% to 24% in 10 months (Jan-Nov 2025). Alo went 8% to 14% in 2 months. GM CAN lag share loss by 2-3 years.
   - Score adjustment: 7-8/10 (not 10/10)

2. **Market Position (manual 0/8).** Tool assigns 0 because it cannot assess manually. But the real score should be 3-4/8 given: CEO vacuum, 2 product recalls in 12 months, DTC share erosion, 3-way governance fight.
   - Score: 3-4/8

3. **ROIC Persistence fair at 7/7** given historical consistency.

4. **Net adjustment: -0 to -3 points** (14-17/25 vs 17/25)

### Capital Allocation (Tool: 3/10 -- Adversarial: 2-3/10)

$1B buyback authorization at potentially elevated prices during a governance crisis is questionable capital allocation. Insider net selling of $3.3M over 90 days is directionally negative.

### Adversarial QS Summary

| Category | Tool Score | Adversarial Score | Delta |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| Financial Quality | 35/40 | 27-30/40 | -5 to -8 |
| Growth Quality | 25/25 | 17-20/25 | -5 to -8 |
| Moat Evidence | 17/25 | 14-17/25 | 0 to -3 |
| Capital Allocation | 3/10 | 2-3/10 | 0 to -1 |
| **TOTAL** | **80/100** | **60-70/100** | **-10 to -20** |
| **Tier** | **A** | **B (Quality Value)** | **Downgrade** |

**CRITICAL FINDING:** LULU is more likely **Tier B (60-70)** than Tier A (80). The tool uses backward-looking data that does not capture: (a) tariff margin destruction, (b) forward growth deceleration, (c) competitive share erosion, (d) governance crisis. This matters because Tier A justifies lower MoS (~15-20%) while Tier B requires ~25-30%+ MoS.

## Top 5 Riesgos Criticos

### 1. Three-Way Governance Crisis: Wilson vs Elliott vs Board

- **Categoria:** Governance / Fundamental
- **Descripcion:** Lululemon faces an unprecedented governance situation with THREE competing power centers:
  - **The Board** (led by Executive Chair Marti Morfitt + Advent International representatives): Running the CEO search, interim co-CEOs Meghan Frank (CFO) and Andre Maestrini (CCO)
  - **Chip Wilson** (founder, ~9% stake): Launched proxy fight Dec 29, nominating Marc Maurer (ex-On Running co-CEO), Laura Gentile (ex-ESPN CMO), Eric Hirshberg (ex-Activision CEO). Demands Advent directors leave.
  - **Elliott Management** ($1B+ stake, ~5%): Advocating for Jane Nielsen (ex-Ralph Lauren CFO/COO) as CEO. Preparing to force "radical restructuring of board and product strategy."

  These three factions have DIFFERENT visions for the company's direction. The annual meeting (expected June 2026) will be the battleground.

- **Evidencia:**
  - CEO departed Jan 31, 2026 -- 11 days without permanent CEO and counting
  - Wilson proxy nominations filed Dec 29, 2025
  - Wilson demanded Advent board members leave (Jan 29, 2026)
  - Elliott disclosed $1B+ stake Dec 18, 2025
  - Elliott pushing Jane Nielsen as CEO candidate
  - "Get Low" product pulled Jan 20 under interim leadership -- quality control during vacuum
  - Bernstein downgraded citing "growing uncertainty"

- **Probabilidad:** **Alta** -- this is HAPPENING NOW, not hypothetical
- **Impacto si materializa (continued paralysis):** 20-35% additional downside
  - Strategic decisions frozen (who approves 2027 product strategy?)
  - Spring 2026 launch execution compromised by leadership distraction
  - Board instability if Wilson/Elliott win seats creates split governance
  - New CEO hire delayed or compromised by competing factions
  - Institutional investors exit due to governance uncertainty
  - ~15-25% of fair value at risk from governance discount alone

- **Mitigante:** Wilson's and Elliott's nominees are CREDIBLE retail operators. If either faction's CEO candidate is hired, it could be a positive catalyst. The proxy fight may ACCELERATE needed changes.
- **Kill condition?:** YES -- if no permanent CEO by July 2026 (6 months post-McDonald), OR if proxy fight results in fragmented board with no clear strategic authority.

### 2. Tariff Margin Destruction: FAR Worse Than Thesis Claims

- **Categoria:** Financial / Geopolitical
- **Descripcion:** The thesis characterizes tariff impact as "marginal (~100bp GM)" and "Low" impact. This is **SEVERELY understated by at least 3x.** The actual situation:
  - **Supply chain exposure:** 40% Vietnam (46% tariff), 17% Cambodia (49% tariff), 11% Indonesia (32% tariff), ~30% China/Sri Lanka (various rates)
  - **FY2025 tariff impact:** $240 million gross profit reduction
  - **FY2026 tariff impact:** $320 million minimum operating margin reduction
  - **De minimis removal impact:** Additional ~$170M (170bp of 220bp tariff-related decline)
  - **Total annualized impact:** $320M on ~$11B revenue = ~300bp margin compression
  - **Key risk:** These tariff rates are CURRENT. Further escalation is a live risk (world view: "Incertidumbre comercial global ALTA, probabilidad 60-70%")

- **Evidencia:**
  - Lululemon's own FY2026 guidance: $320M net tariff impact
  - Management REFUSED to give FY2026 operating margin guidance -- will update March 31
  - Vietnam tariffs jumped to 46% -- Lululemon's LARGEST manufacturing country
  - Operating margin already compressed to 18.5% in Q1 FY2026 (from 23.7% trailing)
  - Supply chain diversification to alternatives takes 12-24 months
  - "Cannot raise prices aggressively during a fragile spending environment" -- management
  - De minimis removal specifically strains LULU's Canada-to-US e-commerce fulfillment (2/3 of US e-commerce orders)

- **Probabilidad:** **Alta** (tariffs already enacted) + **Media** for further escalation
- **Impacto cuantificado:**
  - Base case: 300bp margin compression ($320M)
  - If Vietnam tariffs stay at 46% (vs prior 10%): additional $150-200M impact on top of guidance
  - Total worst case: 450-500bp operating margin compression
  - Operating margin could fall from ~23.7% to 18-19% (Q1 FY2026 already at 18.5%)
  - FCF margin drops to 10-11% from 15%
  - DCF impact: reduces fair value by 20-30%

- **Mitigante:** Pricing power (GM 59.2% suggests room), vendor negotiations, network optimization. But management said they cannot price aggressively.
- **Kill condition?:** SHOULD ADD -- "Operating margin falls below 18% for 2 consecutive quarters."

### 3. US Business: Structural Decline Masked as Cyclical

- **Categoria:** Fundamental
- **Descripcion:** The thesis asserts US weakness is CYCLICAL (product staleness) not STRUCTURAL (moat erosion). The evidence is more ambiguous than the thesis admits:
  - Americas comps: -5% in Q3 2025 (accelerating decline)
  - DTC market share: dropped 30% to 24% in 10 months
  - Alo Yoga: grew 8% to 14% DTC share in just 2 months
  - Vuori: raised $825M at $5.5B valuation, targeting 100 stores by 2026
  - TWO product launches failed on basic quality (Breezethrough 2024, Get Low 2026)
  - SG&A deleveraging: 39.8% in Q1 FY2026 vs 35.5% FY2025

  **The critical question:** GM can lag market share loss by 2-3 years. Nike maintained its GM even as it was losing share before eventually compressing. If DTC share erosion continues, GM compression follows with a lag. The thesis uses current GM as proof the moat is intact -- but it may be a lagging indicator.

- **Evidencia:**
  - Among high-income consumers ($200k+), Vuori's share rose from 11.87% to 15.31% (2023-2025). This is LULU's core demographic being poached.
  - Alo Yoga seeking $10B valuation (was $4B in 2023) -- competitor is scaling fast
  - Inventory up 11% vs revenue growth 6.5% -- supply outpacing demand
  - UBS warns US sales "may not turn sustainably positive in 2026"
  - Bernstein downgrade: "delayed product strategy" carries "increased risk"
  - Lululemon pulled its own "Get Low" launch due to see-through fabric -- basic quality failure

- **Probabilidad:** **Media-Alta** (40-50%)
- **Impacto si materializa:**
  - Americas revenue declines 3-5% annually for 3+ years
  - GM compresses 200-400bp as pricing power erodes
  - P/E re-rates to 8-10x (closer to Under Armour territory)
  - Fair value: $110-140 (35-45% below current price)

- **Mitigante:** Spring 2026 product refresh (35% newness) is the real test. If it succeeds, structural narrative weakens. But note: this is a HOPE, not evidence. And the last two product launches FAILED.
- **Kill condition?:** Should ADD: "DTC market share falls below 20%"

### 4. Serial Product Quality Failures Signal Execution Breakdown

- **Categoria:** Fundamental
- **Descripcion:** Two premium product launches failed on BASIC quality in 12 months:
  - **Breezethrough (2024):** Pulled from stores due to sizing/fit issues. Lululemon's attempt to compete with Alo's "Airlift" line failed.
  - **Get Low (January 2026):** Pulled from online sales within days of launch due to see-through fabric. Customers complained about sheerness. Founder Chip Wilson publicly expressed outrage.

  The thesis frames the product refresh as a CATALYST. But the last two times LULU tried to innovate, they shipped defective product. This is not "staleness" -- it is an EXECUTION problem. And it is happening while there is no permanent CEO and interim leadership is distracted by proxy fights.

- **Evidencia:**
  - Bloomberg reported Get Low pulled Jan 20, 2026
  - Lululemon "blames customers" narrative re-emerged (echoing the 2013 see-through pants debacle)
  - Wilson specifically cited product quality as reason for proxy fight
  - Spring 2026's 35% newness comes from "untested designer in higher-risk lifestyle categories" (Bernstein)
  - The creative team was recently refreshed -- new team has not proven itself

- **Probabilidad:** **Media** (30-40%) that Spring 2026 launch has quality issues
- **Impacto si materializa:**
  - Another product recall destroys the "product refresh as catalyst" narrative
  - Brand credibility with core customers erodes
  - Stock could drop 10-15% on news of a third quality failure
  - Validates the "structural, not cyclical" bear thesis

- **Mitigante:** Management is aware and investing in quality. New creative team may have learned from failures.
- **Kill condition?:** Should monitor: if Spring 2026 launch has material quality issues, re-evaluate entire thesis.

### 5. Elliott Management's "Radical Restructuring" Push

- **Categoria:** Governance / Valoracion
- **Descripcion:** Elliott Management ($1B+ stake, ~5% of company) is not a passive investor. Reports indicate Elliott is:
  - Pushing Jane Nielsen (ex-Ralph Lauren) as CEO
  - Preparing to force "radical restructuring" of board and product strategy
  - Planning to demand cost reductions and "disciplined approach to inventory management"
  - Expected to force "strategic update calls" in February and March

  Elliott's activist playbook typically involves: (a) aggressive cost-cutting, (b) margin improvement programs, (c) leadership changes, (d) potential divestitures or strategic alternatives. While this CAN create value, it can also:
  - Cause short-term disruption
  - Conflict with brand-building investments
  - Create tension with other factions (Wilson, existing board)

- **Evidencia:**
  - CNBC: Elliott "preparing to force radical restructuring"
  - Elliott controlling ~5% of shares
  - Elliott's track record: aggressive, short-term focused
  - Competing with Wilson's vision (both want different CEOs)

- **Probabilidad:** **Alta** (Elliott is already engaged)
- **Impacto si materializa:**
  - Positive: cost discipline, margin improvement, better CEO
  - Negative: brand damage from cost-cutting, internal conflict, leadership instability
  - Net impact: uncertain, could be positive or negative
  - Risk: if Elliott and Wilson are BOTH fighting the board, paralysis deepens

- **Mitigante:** Elliott has resources and expertise. Their CEO candidate (Nielsen) is experienced.
- **Kill condition?:** Monitor: if Elliott pushes for actions that damage brand equity (excessive cost-cutting in product quality, marketing reduction), reassess.

## Risks NOT Mentioned in Thesis

| Riesgo | Severidad | Mencionado in thesis? | Comentario |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|------------|
| **Vietnam tariffs at 46% (not 10%)** | CRITICAL | NO -- thesis says "~100bp GM, Low impact" | Thesis was written Feb 5. Vietnam tariffs were escalated post-thesis. The $320M FY2026 impact alone is 300bp. With 46% Vietnam tariff, impact could be far higher. |
| **Elliott Management $1B activist stake** | HIGH | NO | Elliott disclosed Dec 18, pushing for radical restructuring. This is a major governance variable. |
| **De minimis exemption removal** | HIGH | NO | 2/3 of US e-commerce orders fulfilled from Canada. De minimis removal adds ~170bp to tariff-related costs. |
| **Three-way governance fight (Wilson + Elliott + Board)** | CRITICAL | Minimizado -- mentions Wilson kill condition | Thesis does not mention Elliott at all. The three-way dynamic is fundamentally different from a simple Wilson proxy fight. |
| **Serial product quality failures (Breezethrough + Get Low)** | HIGH | NO | Two premium launches failed on BASIC quality in 12 months. Thesis mentions "product refresh" as catalyst without acknowledging the failure pattern. |
| **Operating margin already at 18.5% in Q1 FY2026** | HIGH | NO (thesis was pre-Q1 data) | This is ALREADY near the kill condition threshold I recommend. |
| **SG&A deleverage to 39.8%** | HIGH | NO | Operating leverage is going the wrong direction. |
| **Inventory buildup +11% vs revenue +6.5%** | MEDIUM | NO | Supply outpacing demand = markdown risk. |
| **Securities class action (Patel v. LULU)** | MEDIUM | NO | Active suit in SDNY. If survives motion to dismiss, settlement $50-200M. |
| **Insider net selling $3.3M in 90 days** | MEDIUM | NO | All transactions are SALES. No insider buying. |
| **Nike NikeSkims launch Spring 2026** | MEDIUM | NO | Nike's biggest move into premium women's athleisure directly competes with LULU. |
| **Affluent consumer becoming more selective** | MEDIUM | NO | 60%+ luxury consumers buying fewer items. McKinsey and JPMorgan flag this. |
| **Chinese TikTok factory knockoffs going viral** | LOW | NO | Undermines premium brand narrative, though limited revenue impact. |
| **PFAS chemicals lawsuit ongoing** | LOW | NO | Manageable but adds to legal risk pile. |
| **"Power of Three x2" $12.5B target will be missed** | HIGH | NO | Flagship strategic target miss undermines management credibility. |

**Count: 15 material risks not mentioned or severely minimized in thesis.**

## Kill Conditions Assessment

### Thesis Kill Conditions (7 total)

| # | Kill Condition | Assessment |
|---|---------------|------------|
| 1 | GM < 50% | **Too generous.** By the time GM hits 50% from 59%, massive value destruction has occurred. Tighten to: GM < 55% as warning, < 52% as kill. |
| 2 | 3 quarters negative global comps | **Masks the problem.** International growth offsets US decline. Should separate: Americas comps negative 4+ quarters as kill. |
| 3 | FCF negative 2+ quarters | **Reasonable.** Keep. |
| 4 | Bad CEO hire | **Vague.** Define "bad": no retail experience, no DTC experience, or insider with no brand-building track record. |
| 5 | Wilson gains board control + disruptive changes | **Partially happening.** Wilson has filed proxy nominations. Needs to be more specific about what "disruptive" means. |
| 6 | DTC channel commoditized by platform shift | Reasonable long-term kill condition. Monitor social commerce penetration. |
| 7 | Chinese brands achieve quality parity at 40% discount | Reasonable. Monitor Anta/Li-Ning/Maia Active international expansion. |

### Kill Conditions to ADD (Missing)

1. **No permanent CEO within 6 months of McDonald departure** (by July 31, 2026). Extended vacuum = governance failure.
2. **DTC market share falls below 20%.** Currently 24%, down from 30%. This is the canary for moat erosion.
3. **Operating margin falls below 18% for 2 consecutive quarters.** Already at 18.5% in Q1.
4. **China revenue growth decelerates below 10%.** China is the thesis's growth engine.
5. **Third product quality failure/recall in 12 months.** Would confirm systemic execution problem.
6. **Elliott Management publicly campaigns for breakup, sale, or radical strategy change.** Indicates institutional investor has lost confidence in standalone company.

## Fair Value Challenge (UPDATED)

### Thesis FV: $261 Weighted

### Adversarial FV Adjustments

Starting from thesis Base Case DCF of $241:
- Tariff impact adjustment (46% Vietnam, $320M+ annualized): **-$25 to -35**
- De minimis removal ($170M+ additional): **-$10 to -15**
- Lower forward growth rate correction (5-8% vs 14% historical): **-$15 to -25**
- Lease obligation adjustment ($1.575B operating leases): **-$10 to -15**
- Governance/execution discount (no CEO, proxy fight, 2 product failures): **-$15 to -20**
- Competition risk haircut (5% for DTC share erosion): **-$10 to -12**

**Adversarial Base Case DCF: $145-175** (vs thesis $241)

For P/E method: Forward EPS likely $12-13 (Needham expects decline). At 14-16x (appropriate for decelerating growth + governance risk vs thesis 20x): **$170-210** (vs thesis $290)

### Adversarial Reconciliation

| Method | Thesis FV | Adversarial FV | Delta |
|--------|----------|----------------|-------|
| DCF Base (60%) | $241 | $155-175 | -28% to -36% |
| P/E (40%) | $290 | $185-210 | -28% to -36% |
| **Weighted** | **$261** | **$167-190** | **-27% to -36%** |

### Adversarial Scenario Analysis

| Scenario | Adversarial FV | Probability | Key Assumptions |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Bear** (structural US decline + tariff escalation + governance failure) | $100-130 | 25% | US comps -5%/yr for 3yr, GM compresses to 54%, P/E 8-10x |
| **Base** (cyclical recovery delayed, tariffs bite, new CEO mediocre) | $165-185 | 50% | US comps flat FY2027, GM 56-57%, P/E 14-16x |
| **Bull** (quick CEO hire, product refresh works, tariff mitigation) | $240-280 | 25% | US comps positive, GM holds 58%+, P/E 20-22x |

**Expected Value: 0.25 * $115 + 0.50 * $175 + 0.25 * $260 = $181**

**Adversarial MoS vs current price $179: +1%**

**THIS IS ESSENTIALLY NO MARGIN OF SAFETY.** For a company with 11 HIGH/CRITICAL risks, no permanent CEO, a three-way proxy fight, $320M+ in tariff headwinds, serial product failures, and DTC share erosion.

---

## Riesgo Agregado

- **Numero de riesgos HIGH+CRITICAL:** 11
- **Riesgos correlacionados:** YES, in multiple clusters:
  - **Governance cluster:** CEO vacuum + Wilson proxy + Elliott activism + product quality failures (all compound each other -- no leadership to fix execution)
  - **Profitability cluster:** Tariffs + de minimis + SG&A deleverage + inventory buildup (all squeeze margins simultaneously)
  - **Competitive cluster:** DTC share loss + Alo/Vuori growth + Nike NikeSkims + consumer selectivity (all erode LULU's position)
  - **China cluster:** Geopolitical risk + consumer boycott risk + growth deceleration + TikTok knockoffs (all threaten the growth engine)

- **Correlation matters because:** In a "bad scenario," governance paralysis PREVENTS the company from responding to competitive threats AND tariff headwinds simultaneously. The risks do not just add up -- they MULTIPLY.

### Risk Score Final: **HIGH (bordering VERY HIGH)**

**Justification:** 11 HIGH/CRITICAL risks with strong correlation across 4 clusters. The thesis characterizes LULU as a "fallen angel" with "cyclical, not structural" problems. Our independent assessment finds:

1. The cyclical-vs-structural question is GENUINELY uncertain, with evidence for structural decline stronger than thesis admits
2. Tariff impact is 3x+ what thesis claims
3. The governance situation (3-way fight) is the most complex in the company's history
4. Serial product failures undermine the "product refresh = catalyst" narrative
5. DTC share erosion (30% to 24%) is a LEADING indicator of moat decay
6. The adversarial fair value ($167-190) offers essentially NO margin of safety at current price

## Comparison with Prior Adversarial Reviews (13 positions)

| Metric | Pattern (12/13 prior) | LULU |
|--------|----------------------|------|
| Thesis FV inflated? | Yes, avg -15% | Yes, -27% to -36% (WORST of all 13) |
| QS overstated? | Yes, 12/13 | Yes, 80 -> 60-70 (Tier A -> Tier B) |
| Risks omitted? | Yes, avg 5+ | Yes, **15 material risks** not in thesis |
| Bear case too optimistic? | Yes, pattern | Yes, thesis bear $190 vs adversarial bear $100-130 |

**LULU shows the LARGEST FV inflation and the MOST missed risks of any thesis we have reviewed adversarially.** This is partly because the thesis was written quickly (pre-tariff escalation) and partly because the governance situation evolved rapidly post-thesis.

---

## 🔄 META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres
- **The cyclical vs structural debate is genuinely uncertain.** I lean toward "more structural than thesis admits" but the Spring 2026 product refresh (35% newness, results visible by June) is a real test. If it succeeds, the structural narrative weakens materially.
- **Wilson and Elliott could be NET POSITIVE.** Marc Maurer (ex-On Running) and Jane Nielsen (ex-Ralph Lauren) are both strong candidates. The proxy fight process is messy, but the OUTCOME could be better leadership than what LULU had under McDonald. I cannot fully quantify this optionality.
- **Vietnam tariff rate uncertainty.** I used 46% from search results, which appears to be the "reciprocal tariff" rate from April 2025. The CURRENT effective rate may be different if there have been subsequent negotiations or pauses. The thesis's assumption of ~10% tariff rate is clearly outdated, but 46% may be the worst-case rather than current rate. The $320M guidance from management is the most reliable figure.
- **Operating margin 18.5% in Q1 FY2026.** I found this in search results but could not verify from a primary source. If accurate, it is very close to my recommended kill condition of 18%. Need to verify from Q4/Q1 earnings.

### Riesgos que Podrian Estar Subestimados
- **DTC market share erosion.** The pace (30% to 24% in 10 months, Alo 8% to 14% in 2 months) is EXTRAORDINARY. If this continues at even half the rate through Spring 2026, it could cross below 20% by year end.
- **China risk.** The thesis treats China as the growth savior. But world/current_view.md says "Evitar China." Chinese TikTok factory knockoffs specifically targeting LULU are going viral -- this could undermine brand exclusivity in LULU's fastest-growing market.
- **NikeSkims launch.** Nike partnering with Kim Kardashian's Skims brand for premium women's athleisure in Spring 2026 is the first time Nike has DIRECTLY targeted LULU's core customer with a comparable product. Nike has $95B market cap and unlimited marketing budget.

### Discrepancias con Thesis
1. **QS overstated by 10-20 points (Tier A vs Tier B).** Largest QS inflation we have seen.
2. **Tariff impact understated by 3x+.** Thesis says ~100bp, actual $320M+ = ~300bp minimum.
3. **Fair value inflated by 27-36%.** Thesis $261 vs adversarial $167-190.
4. **Governance risk upgraded from "manageable" to CRITICAL.** Three-way fight, not just "CEO transition."
5. **15 material risks not in thesis.** Most of any adversarial review.
6. **Bear case too optimistic by $60-90.** Thesis $190 vs adversarial $100-130.
7. **NVO comparison is flawed.** NVO has pharmaceutical moat (patents, FDA, manufacturing complexity). LULU has brand + community -- BOTH of which CAN be eroded, as Alo demonstrates. These are not equivalent moats.

### Sugerencias para el Sistema
1. **Thesis FV should be updated IMMEDIATELY** to reflect tariff escalation and governance developments since Feb 5.
2. **Consider PROBATION status.** The adversarial FV ($167-190) is essentially at current price ($179), offering no meaningful margin of safety for a HIGH-risk position.
3. **Set monitoring triggers for Q4 earnings (March 31):** Operating margin, Americas comps, CEO search update, FY2026 margin guidance.
4. **Create governance risk sub-score.** QS tool does not capture CEO vacuums, proxy fights, or board instability. LULU proves this is material.
5. **DCF tool should accept manual FCF overrides.** For companies with known structural cost increases (tariffs), using historical FCF misleads.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator
1. **Given adversarial FV of $167-190 and current price $179, the MoS is 0-6%.** For a Tier B company (adversarial QS 60-70) with 11 HIGH/CRITICAL risks, is this sufficient? Precedents suggest Tier B needs 25-30%+ MoS. Should we EXIT?
2. **Should the position be moved to PROBATION?** The adversarial review found materially more risk than any prior review (15 missed risks, 27-36% FV inflation, worst of 13 reviews).
3. **Should we set a tight stop-loss before Q4 earnings (March 31)?** If earnings reveal margin guidance worse than $320M, or CEO search has no progress, or Spring 2026 sell-through disappointing, the stock could drop 15-25%.
4. **How much weight to give the activist optionality?** Wilson and Elliott both bring strong CEO candidates. The proxy fight is messy but could result in BETTER leadership. Is there a way to quantify this upside option against the governance risk downside?
