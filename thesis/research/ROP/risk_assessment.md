# Risk Assessment: ROP (Roper Technologies)

## Fecha: 2026-02-12

## Risk Score: HIGH

**Justification:** Multiple concurrent headwinds (Deltek/government, DAT/freight, Neptune weakness), elevated leverage for a "software compounder" (2.9x Net Debt/EBITDA), $22B+ goodwill on a $36B market cap, and structural questions about AI disruption to vertical software moats. The -44% decline from ATH is not random -- it reflects real fundamental deterioration in 3 of 30+ business units simultaneously, compounded by multiple analyst downgrades and rising short interest.

## Top 3 Riesgos Criticos

### 1. Elevated Leverage + Goodwill Concentration = Balance Sheet Fragility

- **Categoria:** Financial
- **Descripcion:** Roper carries $9.3B in total debt against only $297M cash (net debt $9.0B). Net Debt/EBITDA is 2.9x. Goodwill is $19.3B and intangible assets $9.1B, together constituting ~82% of total equity ($18.9B). The company recently issued $2B in new senior notes (Aug 2025) at rates of 4.25%-5.10%, with a $700M bond maturing in 2027 at just 1.4% that will need refinancing at significantly higher rates.
- **Evidencia:**
  - Total debt $9.3B, cash $297M = net debt $9.0B
  - Goodwill $19.3B on $36B market cap = 54% of enterprise value is goodwill
  - ROIC only 7.0% (2024) vs WACC 8.5% = NEGATIVE SPREAD. This is the single most damning number for a "quality compounder." The company is destroying value on an invested capital basis.
  - FCF-to-debt ratio near 4x (debt is ~4x FCF) -- elevated for software business
  - $700M of 1.4% notes due 2027 will refinance at ~4.5-5.0%, adding ~$25M annual interest
  - Interest coverage estimated at ~5-6x EBITDA -- adequate but not comfortable for a Tier A candidate
- **Probabilidad:** Alta -- this is not a future risk, it is the current state
- **Impacto si materializa:** If any major acquisition underperforms, triggering even a partial goodwill write-down (say $2-3B), it would wipe out 1-2 years of EPS. A $5B+ write-down is conceivable if multiple units underperform simultaneously. Combined with leverage, this could trigger credit rating downgrades and raise borrowing costs further.
- **Estimated impact:** 20-40% downside in a write-down scenario
- **Mitigante:** Strong FCF generation (~$2.5B/yr), diversified across 30+ businesses, recently refinanced near-term maturities
- **Kill condition?:** YES -- if ROIC-WACC spread remains negative for 2+ consecutive years, the compounding thesis is broken

### 2. Deltek Government Contracting Exposure in Era of DOGE + Spending Cuts

- **Categoria:** Fundamental + Regulatory
- **Descripcion:** Deltek provides ERP software to government contractors. The 2025 government shutdown, DOGE-driven budget cuts, and civilian spending freezes have directly impacted Deltek's revenue. Management explicitly guided that 2026 outlook "does not bake in improvement at Deltek's GovCon business." This is not a temporary blip -- DOGE represents a structural shift toward smaller government, and the federal IT contracting market is experiencing unprecedented volatility with "potentially declining civilian budgets."
- **Evidencia:**
  - Deltek saw slowdown in September as agencies paused ahead of shutdown
  - 2026 guidance explicitly excludes Deltek recovery
  - Post-shutdown contracting delays + DOGE-driven terminations creating "unprecedented market volatility"
  - Civilian spending budgets potentially declining structurally
  - Perpetual license revenue at Deltek declining as GovCon enterprise still heavily buys perpetual (not SaaS)
  - Deltek estimated at ~10-12% of Roper revenue -- material but not existential
- **Probabilidad:** Alta -- government spending pressure is ACTIVE and STRUCTURAL, not temporary
- **Impacto si materializa:** Deltek revenue could decline 10-20% in a sustained spending cut environment. At ~$800M-$1B revenue, that is $80-200M revenue impact. Given Roper's high fixed-cost structure on goodwill amortization, margin impact is amplified. Could also trigger goodwill impairment testing for Deltek specifically.
- **Estimated impact:** 5-10% of total Roper revenue at risk, 8-15% EPS impact
- **Mitigante:** Omnibus appropriations expected to improve 2H 2026. Defense spending remains strong. Deltek serves both defense and civilian contractors.
- **Kill condition?:** YES -- if DOGE cuts become permanent and Deltek revenue declines >15% for 2+ years, the goodwill paid for Deltek is impaired

### 3. AI Disruption to Vertical Software Moats -- The Existential Question

- **Categoria:** Competitive + Fundamental
- **Descripcion:** Roper's entire investment thesis rests on "sticky vertical software with high switching costs." But the 2026 software sell-off has been driven by a fundamental question: does AI erode software moats by reducing barriers to entry? If AI can generate custom code instantly, the barrier to creating competing niche software drops dramatically. "Micro-SaaS" competitors can be spun up in days. More critically, if customers use AI to reduce headcount by 30%, per-seat SaaS revenue drops 30% automatically under current pricing models.
- **Evidencia:**
  - Global software stocks extended losses in Feb 2026 on AI disruption fears (CNBC reported sector-wide sell-off)
  - PitchBook analysis: "AI-driven risk sets up the software sector for divergence"
  - Multiple sources describe "SaaSmageddon" hitting vertical software specifically
  - Roper's vertical niches (legal tech, government ERP, freight analytics) are exactly the type of workflow-heavy software that AI could augment or replace
  - Roper management hired AI accelerator team (Shane Luke, Eddie Raphael) -- acknowledges the risk but response is early stage
  - 2026 guidance explicitly "does not assume meaningful revenue uplift from AI development work"
- **Probabilidad:** Media -- this is a 3-5 year structural risk, not immediate. Vertical software with deep workflow integration is MORE defensible than horizontal SaaS. But the risk is real and growing.
- **Impacto si materializa:** If AI erodes switching costs and enables micro-SaaS competitors in even 20% of Roper's 30+ verticals, the long-duration growth premium evaporates. Multiple could compress from ~23x P/E to 14-16x P/E (comparable to mature industrial conglomerates). On current EPS of ~$14.50, that is $203-$232 per share = 30-40% further downside from current $334.
- **Estimated impact:** 30-40% further downside in structural disruption scenario over 3-5 years
- **Mitigante:** Deep domain expertise, regulatory-driven workflows, high data migration costs. Not all verticals equally vulnerable. AI accelerator team shows awareness.
- **Kill condition?:** YES -- if any major Roper vertical loses >20% market share to AI-enabled competitors, or if organic growth turns negative for 2+ years

## Perfect Storm Scenario: What Happens If EVERYTHING Goes Wrong?

**Scenario:** US recession in 2H 2026 + DOGE spending cuts deepen + freight cycle stays depressed + AI disruption accelerates + Neptune loses market share + goodwill write-down triggered

**Mechanics:**
1. **Revenue:** Organic growth turns negative (-2-5%). Deltek -15%, DAT -10%, Neptune -10%. Total revenue flat to declining despite acquisitions.
2. **Margins:** EBITDA margin compresses from 40% to 35% on revenue deleverage. FCF drops from $2.5B to $1.8-2.0B.
3. **Goodwill:** Impairment testing triggers write-down on Deltek ($2-3B) and potentially DAT ($1-2B). Total write-down $3-5B.
4. **Debt:** Refinancing $700M of 1.4% notes in 2027 at 5%+ adds $25M+ to annual interest. Credit agencies downgrade outlook.
5. **Multiple:** Market re-rates from 23x P/E to 14-16x as serial acquirer model questioned. AI narrative accelerates de-rating.
6. **Stock:** EPS drops to $12-13 (from $14.50). At 14-16x multiple: $168-$208 per share. That is 38-50% further downside from $334.

**Probability of perfect storm:** Low (10-15%). But individual components are each at 25-50% probability.

**Key insight:** The elements are CORRELATED. A recession makes freight worse, reduces government spending further, accelerates cost-cutting (AI adoption by customers), and makes debt more dangerous. This correlation amplifies the tail risk.

## Riesgos NO Mencionados en Thesis

*Note: No thesis exists yet for ROP. These are risks that a bullish thesis would likely minimize or miss.*

| Riesgo | Severidad | Likely Minimized in Bull Case? | Comentario |
|--------|-----------|-------------------------------|------------|
| ROIC < WACC (negative spread) | HIGH | YES -- bulls focus on EBITDA margins and FCF, not ROIC | The 7.0% ROIC vs 8.5% WACC means Roper is DESTROYING value on invested capital. This is masked by high absolute FCF due to sheer size. |
| Goodwill = 54% of enterprise value | HIGH | YES -- bulls say "it's just accounting" | But write-downs are real. If paid 15-20x EBITDA for acquisitions that decelerate to 3-5% growth, the math doesn't work. |
| 3 business units declining simultaneously | HIGH | YES -- bulls say "only 15-20% of revenue" | Deltek + DAT + Neptune all weakening at once is not bad luck, it may signal broader organic growth issues in the portfolio. |
| CEO net seller (30K sold vs 10K bought) | MEDIUM | YES -- bulls focus on the director's recent $500K purchase | Net selling by CEO during a -44% drawdown is NOT confidence-inspiring. If the CEO believed shares were cheap, he'd be buying aggressively. |
| 2027 debt refinancing at much higher rates | MEDIUM | YES -- bulls focus on total liquidity ($6B capacity) | $700M at 1.4% refinancing at ~5% = $25M annual interest increase. Not enormous but adds to leverage pressure. |
| SaaS transition creating near-term revenue headwind | MEDIUM | YES -- bulls call this "positive long-term" | True, but it masks organic weakness. When you strip out M&A growth (8%) and SaaS transition noise, organic growth may be only 4-5% -- not compounder territory. |
| Conglomerate discount risk | MEDIUM | YES -- bulls say "decentralized, not conglomerate" | With 30+ businesses, no unified product, and reliance on M&A, this IS a conglomerate. If the market decides to apply a conglomerate discount, multiple compresses 20-30%. |
| AI disruption to vertical software | HIGH | YES -- bulls say "deep domain, high switching costs" | This is the trillion-dollar question. The software sell-off of Feb 2026 says the market is taking this seriously. |

## Kill Conditions Sugeridas (Minimum 5)

1. **ROIC remains below WACC for 3+ consecutive years** -- if the company cannot earn its cost of capital, the compounding thesis is fundamentally broken regardless of FCF generation. This is the most important kill condition.

2. **Goodwill impairment charge exceeding $3B** -- would signal that acquired businesses are materially underperforming purchase price assumptions. At $3B+, it is not a "one-off" but systemic overpayment.

3. **Organic revenue growth turns negative for 2 consecutive quarters** -- Roper's entire premium valuation assumes it is a growth compounder. If organic growth goes negative (stripping out M&A), the premium is unjustified.

4. **Net Debt/EBITDA exceeds 4.0x** -- would signal that the acquisition machine is outrunning cash generation. Combined with goodwill concentration, this would put the investment-grade credit rating at risk.

5. **Deltek revenue declines >20% in any trailing 12-month period** -- would confirm that DOGE/government spending cuts are structural and deep, potentially triggering impairment of the ~$2-3B goodwill attributed to Deltek.

6. **Management makes an acquisition >$5B that the market rejects (stock drops >10% on announcement)** -- would signal loss of capital allocation discipline, the single most important quality in a serial acquirer.

7. **Two or more analyst rating changes to "Sell" from current "Hold"** -- would confirm that the bull case has broken down beyond near-term headwinds.

## Insider Activity Analysis

**CEO L. Neil Hunn:**
- Bought 10,000 shares for ~$4.5M
- Sold 30,000 shares for ~$13.3M
- **NET SELLER by $8.8M** -- this is concerning during a -44% drawdown

**Director Thomas Patrick Joyce Jr.:**
- Bought 1,400 shares at $358.46 on Feb 6, 2026 ($502K)
- This is a POSITIVE signal, buying near 52-week lows

**Aggregate insider activity (last 3 months):**
- Purchased: 12,600 shares (~$5.6M)
- The buying is encouraging but CEO's net selling dominates the picture

**Assessment:** MIXED but LEANING NEGATIVE. In a stock down 44%, you want to see the CEO aggressively buying, not net selling. The director's buy is positive but small relative to CEO's net sales. Institutional ownership at 92.75% provides some floor but also means selling pressure can be concentrated.

---

## Short Interest Analysis

- Short interest: 1,800,668 shares (as of Dec 15)
- Growth rate: +25.2% in one month (from 1,438,108)
- Percentage of float: ~1.7%

**Assessment:** Short interest is rising but still low in absolute terms (1.7% of float). The 25% monthly increase is notable and suggests growing bearish conviction, but this is not a "heavily shorted" stock. No dedicated short seller reports found. The risk here is modest -- more of a sentiment indicator than a catalyst for further decline.

---

## Analyst Sentiment Summary

**Recent downgrades:**
- **Melius Research:** Downgraded BUY to HOLD, PT $479
- **Stifel:** Downgraded BUY to HOLD, PT cut $550 to $385
- **Oppenheimer:** Downgraded OUTPERFORM to PERFORM, PT withdrawn

**Consensus:** "Hold" from 18 analysts. Average PT ~$478.53 (implies ~43% upside from current $334). But this is a LAGGING indicator -- PTs are still being cut.

**Assessment:** Three downgrades from buy-side in quick succession post-Q4 earnings is significant. The consensus "Hold" rating with declining PTs suggests analysts see the headwinds as real but believe the -44% decline has priced in much of the bad news. The spread between current price ($334) and average PT ($479) is unusually wide, suggesting high uncertainty about recovery timeline.

## Financial Deep Dive

### Debt Structure (Known)
| Instrument | Amount | Rate | Maturity |
|-----------|--------|------|----------|
| Senior Notes | $700M | 1.40% | 2027 |
| Senior Notes | $500M | 4.25% | 2028 |
| Senior Notes | $500M | 4.45% | 2030 |
| Senior Notes | $1,000M | 5.10% | 2035 |
| Other/Revolver | ~$6.6B | Various | Various |
| **Total** | **~$9.3B** | | |

**Revolver:** $2.7B available
**Cash:** $297M
**Total liquidity:** ~$3.0B

### Key Financial Ratios
| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Net Debt/EBITDA | 2.9x | Elevated for software business |
| ROIC | 7.0% | BELOW WACC (8.5%) -- destroying value |
| FCF Margin | ~31% | Strong |
| Gross Margin | 69.3% | Strong, stable |
| Operating Margin | 28.4% | Strong, stable |
| EBITDA Margin | 39.8% | Strong |
| P/E | 23.5x | Not cheap for 4-5% organic growth |
| FCF Yield | ~7.0% | Reasonable (~$2.5B FCF / $36B market cap) |
| Dividend Yield | 1.1% | Low, payout ratio 23% |
| EPS CAGR (3yr) | -30.7% | Heavily distorted by 2022 one-time ($42.92 EPS) |
| Revenue CAGR (3yr) | +14.5% | Flattered by acquisitions; organic ~5-6% |

### Quality Score Assessment
- **QS Tool: 48/100 (Tier C)**
- The tool score is LOW because:
  - ROIC-WACC spread is NEGATIVE (0 points)
  - EPS CAGR is deeply negative (distorted by 2022 one-off)
  - Leverage is elevated (5/10)
  - Market position and insider ownership score zero
  - ROIC persistence is poor (2/7)
- **My adjusted assessment:** Even being generous, this is a **Tier B at best** (55-65 range) after accounting for the strong FCF profile, wide moat characteristics, and the EPS distortion. But the negative ROIC-WACC spread is real and structural (driven by massive goodwill from expensive acquisitions).

---

## Riesgo Agregado

- **Numero de riesgos HIGH+CRITICAL:** 6
- **Riesgos correlacionados?** YES -- Multiple correlations:
  - Recession correlates: Deltek (government spending), DAT (freight), Neptune (municipal capex), leverage risk (refinancing), multiple compression
  - AI disruption correlates: SaaS transition headwind, vertical software moat erosion, multiple compression
  - Government policy correlates: Deltek (DOGE), debt refinancing (rates), macro cycle
- **Risk Score Final: HIGH**

The concentration of correlated risks is what elevates this from MEDIUM to HIGH. In isolation, each risk is manageable. But they are NOT independent -- a recession or policy shift worsens 3-4 risks simultaneously.

---

## 🔄 META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres
- **ROIC calculation uncertainty:** The quality_scorer.py shows ROIC 7.0% for 2024 but "nan" for 2025. The 2022 ROE of 39.3% vs 2023 8.6% suggests a major one-off in 2022 (likely a divestiture gain). The "true" normalized ROIC may be somewhat higher than 7.0% if we adjust for acquisition timing, but even at 8-9% it barely covers WACC. I could not verify this number independently against the 10-K filing.
- **Deltek revenue percentage:** I estimated Deltek at 10-12% of Roper revenue based on contextual clues from earnings call summaries. The exact number was not available in search results. If Deltek is closer to 15%, the government spending risk is more severe than scored.
- **Goodwill allocation by business unit:** I could not find a breakdown of the $19.3B goodwill by business unit. Knowing which units carry the most goodwill would help assess impairment risk more precisely. If Deltek and DAT together carry $5B+ goodwill, the risk is much higher than if their goodwill is modest.
- **AI disruption timeline:** I scored this as "Media" probability because the 3-5 year timeline for vertical software disruption is uncertain. But the Feb 2026 software sell-off suggests the market is pricing this as a nearer-term risk. My probability may be too conservative.

### Riesgos que Podrian Estar Subestimados
- **AI disruption:** I classified this as "Media" probability but the market's behavior (sector-wide software sell-off, "SaaSmageddon" narrative) suggests the market sees higher probability. If AI agents can truly replicate vertical workflow automation at 10% of the cost, this is a HIGH probability risk.
- **Conglomerate discount:** I listed this as MEDIUM but it could be HIGH. With 30+ businesses, no clear narrative, and a CEO who is a net seller, the market may start applying a conglomerate discount. The -44% drawdown may already partially reflect this.
- **Management capital allocation pressure:** With $6B deployment capacity and investor expectations of M&A-fueled growth, there is enormous pressure to do deals. Historically Roper has been disciplined, but the current environment (high deal multiples, internal pressure, stock down 44%) could tempt management into a bad acquisition.

### Discrepancias con Thesis
No thesis exists yet. However, a bullish thesis for ROP would likely:
1. **Overstate the moat** -- calling it "wide moat" while ignoring that ROIC < WACC suggests the moat is not translating into economic value creation
2. **Minimize leverage** -- calling 2.9x "manageable" without addressing refinancing risk and goodwill fragility
3. **Dismiss AI disruption** -- claiming vertical software is "immune" without acknowledging the structural risk
4. **Focus on FCF, ignore ROIC** -- the strong $2.5B FCF is real but masks value destruction on invested capital basis
5. **Treat the -44% decline as "opportunity"** without examining whether the market has correctly identified structural problems

### Sugerencias para el Sistema
1. **Add ROIC-WACC spread as a prominent check in all thesis templates.** A company with negative ROIC-WACC spread should require explicit justification for why it qualifies as a "compounder." Many serial acquirers look great on FCF but destroy value on ROIC basis due to expensive goodwill.
2. **Add goodwill-to-market-cap ratio as a risk flag.** When goodwill exceeds 40% of market cap, the impairment risk is material and should be called out in every thesis.
3. **For serial acquirers specifically:** Calculate the implied IRR on acquisitions by comparing purchase price to subsequent FCF contribution. This would reveal whether the M&A strategy is actually creating value or just financial engineering.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator
1. Given QS 48 (Tier C) and ROIC < WACC, does this company even meet our minimum quality threshold for further analysis? The fundamental-analyst should be made aware that the "compounder" narrative may be inconsistent with the quantitative reality.
2. The -44% decline from ATH creates an emotional "cheap" feeling. But at 23.5x P/E with 4-5% organic growth and ROIC below WACC, is this genuinely undervalued or is the market correctly re-pricing a deteriorating business?
3. Should we require serial acquirers to demonstrate ROIC > WACC before considering them Tier A? This would filter out companies that grow via expensive acquisitions but do not create shareholder value on an invested capital basis.
