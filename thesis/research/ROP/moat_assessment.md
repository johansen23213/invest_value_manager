# Moat Assessment: ROP (Roper Technologies)

## Fecha: 2026-02-12

## Clasificacion: WIDE

**Score: 22/25**

---

## Executive Summary

Roper Technologies possesses a WIDE moat built primarily on two exceptionally durable sources: (1) extreme switching costs embedded across 30+ vertical software businesses where each product is the system-of-record for its niche, and (2) strong network effects in the freight/logistics vertical via DAT. These are reinforced by efficient scale dynamics in multiple micro-niches where the total addressable market is too small to attract well-funded competitors.

The traditional ROIC metric (5-7%) is misleading for Roper due to $19.3B of goodwill from acquisitions. Excluding goodwill, ROIC has averaged ~35% over the last 3 years. The appropriate framework is Cash Return on Investment (CRI), which has exceeded 500% cumulatively and demonstrates the exceptional economics of the underlying businesses. Gross margins of ~70%, EBITDA margins of ~40%, and FCF margins of ~25-29% -- sustained over a decade -- provide the quantitative backbone for a Wide moat classification.

## Fuentes de Moat Identificadas

| Fuente | Presente | Evidencia | Durabilidad | Trayectoria |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Cost advantage | NO | Not the primary moat source. Roper does not compete on cost. | N/A | N/A |
| Network effects | SI | DAT: 700K+ daily load posts, $1T+ freight transaction database. iTradeNetwork: largest food supply chain network. Both exhibit classic cross-side network effects. | >20 years | Expanding (Convoy + Trucker Tools acquisitions in 2025 strengthened DAT's network) |
| Intangible assets | SI (secondary) | Domain expertise in 30+ verticals (legal, govt contracting, insurance, education, healthcare). Not brand in consumer sense -- but deep regulatory/compliance know-how that is effectively IP. | >15 years | Stable |
| Switching costs | SI (primary) | 95%+ gross retention, 97-98% in best businesses. 3-7 year contracts. System-of-record position in mission-critical workflows. Migration cost = retraining + data migration + compliance risk + months of disruption. | >20 years | Stable to expanding (deeper product integration, AI features increasing stickiness) |
| Efficient scale | SI | Multiple micro-niches where Roper is the dominant player and market is too small for new entrants. Examples: campus card systems (CBORD+Transact), govt contractor ERP (Deltek Costpoint), legal billing (Aderant for Am Law 200). | >20 years | Stable |

## Moat por Subsegmento

### 1. Application Software (~57% of revenue) -- WIDE MOAT

This is the core of Roper's moat. Each business operates as a system-of-record in a specific vertical.

| Business | Vertical | Position | Key Moat Source | Retention | Competition |
|----------|----------|----------|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Deltek** | Govt contracting ERP | #1 (Costpoint serves 9,000+ contractors) | Switching costs + regulatory lock-in (DCAA/FAR compliance) | 95%+ | Unanet gaining share in SMB segment but Costpoint dominant in mid/large. JAMIS a distant third. |
| **Vertafore** | Insurance agency mgmt | Top 2 (with Applied Systems) | Switching costs + data integration | 95%+ | Applied Epic is main rival. Market is oligopolistic -- two players dominate. |
| **Aderant** | Legal billing (Am Law 200) | Top 2 (with Thomson Reuters Elite 3E) | Switching costs + workflow integration | 97%+ | Clio targets SMB, not the same market. Large firm segment is a duopoly. |
| **Frontline Education** | K-12 workforce mgmt | Top 4 in K-12 software | Switching costs + regulatory compliance | 90%+ | PowerSchool #1 by share (10%), but different product categories. Market growing at 6.2% CAGR. |
| **CentralReach** | Behavioral health | Leading platform | Switching costs + clinical workflow | 90%+ (logo), 115-120% NRR | More fragmented market, but CentralReach dominant in ABA therapy. |
| **Strata Decision** | Healthcare financial analytics | Leading platform (merged with Syntellis 2023) | Switching costs + proprietary data | 95%+ | Definitive Healthcare, Epic as partial competitors. Antitrust scrutiny possible. |

**Assessment:** The Application Software segment has WIDE moat characteristics. Switching costs are extreme because these are system-of-record applications integrated into regulated workflows. Customers complain about pricing but do not leave -- the classic switching cost indicator. 43% EBITDA margins in this segment reflect this pricing power.

**Vulnerability note:** Deltek faces temporary headwind from US government shutdown/spending uncertainty (DOGE). Unanet is actively marketing against Deltek Costpoint and winning some SMB accounts. However, for mid-to-large government contractors, the switching costs are prohibitive (DCAA compliance, multi-year contracts, retraining).

---

### 2. Network Software (~20% of revenue) -- WIDE MOAT (strongest individual moat source)

| Business | Vertical | Position | Key Moat Source | Data |
|----------|----------|----------|-----------------|------|
| **DAT** | Freight load board + analytics | #1 in North America | Network effects + data moat | 700K+ daily load posts, $1T+ transaction database |
| **iTradeNetwork** | Food supply chain | Leading global network | Network effects | Connects food producers, distributors, retailers |
| **iPipeline** | Life insurance distribution | Leading platform | Network effects + switching costs | Connects carriers, distributors, agents |

**Assessment:** DAT is the jewel of the network effects moat. It operates as the de facto freight marketplace for US trucking. In 2025, DAT acquired Convoy Platform (automated freight matching), Trucker Tools (freight visibility), and Outgo (financial services for truckers). This is a deliberate strategy to build a comprehensive freight ecosystem that is increasingly difficult to replicate.

The competitive landscape has consolidated into three groups: DAT, Truckstop, and Highway+Triumph. Uber Freight has >15% digital freight matching share but competes more as a digital broker, not a neutral marketplace. DAT's advantage is neutrality (it does not compete with its customers) combined with the largest data set in the industry. The data flywheel (more data -> better analytics -> more users -> more data) is a classic self-reinforcing network effect.

**Network effect durability:** >20 years. Freight marketplaces exhibit winner-take-most dynamics. DAT's 700K daily load posts are 3-5x larger than competitors. This scale advantage compounds over time as the data set becomes more valuable for analytics (DAT iQ).

---

### 3. Technology Enabled Products (~22% of revenue) -- NARROW MOAT

| Business | Vertical | Position | Key Moat Source |
|----------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Neptune** | Water meters (AMR/AMI) | Strong position in US utilities | Installed base + replacement cycles + software lock-in |
| **Verathon** | Medical devices (GlideScope) | Leading in video laryngoscopy | Clinical preference + training + regulatory approval |
| **rf IDEAS** | Identity/credential readers | Niche leader | Switching costs (embedded in access systems) |
| **CIVCO** | Ultrasound accessories | Niche leader | Regulatory + clinical preference |

**Assessment:** The Technology Enabled Products segment has a NARROW moat. These businesses benefit from installed base dynamics, long replacement cycles (Neptune water meters have 15-20 year replacement cycles), and regulatory approvals (Verathon's GlideScope requires clinical training). However, these are less durable than the software switching costs because:
- Hardware is eventually replaceable (unlike embedded software workflows)
- Competitors can match functionality over time
- Pricing power is more modest than in the software segments

This segment has lower margins (~30% EBITDA) than the software segments (~40-43%), confirming a narrower moat.

## Evidencia Cuantitativa

| Metrica | Empresa | Peer Median | Diferencia |
|---------|---------|-------------|------------|
| ROIC (reported, 3yr avg) | ~6% | CSU.TO: >20%, DHR: ~8% | Distorted by $19.3B goodwill |
| ROIC (ex-goodwill, 3yr avg) | ~35% | CSU.TO: >30%, HLMA.L: ~15% | +20pp vs HLMA.L |
| Gross Margin | 69-70% | DHR: ~60%, HLMA.L: ~50% | +10-20pp premium |
| EBITDA Margin | ~40% | DHR: ~30%, HLMA.L: ~22% | +10-18pp premium |
| FCF Margin | ~25-29% | DHR: ~20%, HLMA.L: ~15% | +10-14pp premium |
| Revenue CAGR (3yr) | ~14.5% | DHR: ~5%, HLMA.L: ~10% | +4.5-9.5pp |
| Gross Retention | 95-98% | SaaS median: ~90% | +5-8pp |
| Net Revenue Retention | 115-120% (CentralReach) | SaaS median: 105-110% | +5-10pp |
| Recurring Revenue % | 75-85% | DHR: ~70%, HLMA.L: ~50% | +5-35pp |
| FCF Consistency | 4/4 years positive | - | Consistent |

**ROIC Discussion (Critical):**

The reported ROIC of 5-7% is below WACC (8.5%) and would normally disqualify a Wide moat classification. However, this metric is economically meaningless for serial acquirers because goodwill ($19.3B, 62% of total assets) represents the premium paid for the moat itself, not the operating return on business capital.

The correct lens is either:
1. **ROIC ex-goodwill: ~35%** -- This measures the return on the actual capital employed in the businesses. It is consistently 3-4x WACC.
2. **CRI (management's metric): >500% cumulative** -- This measures cash return on the invested acquisition capital. Over 20+ years, Roper has generated far more cash than the total capital deployed in acquisitions.
3. **FCF yield on invested capital:** $2.3B FCF on ~$25B of cumulative acquisitions = ~9% cash yield, growing at 5-8% organically.

Morningstar upgraded Roper to Wide moat specifically on this basis -- the underlying business economics are exceptional despite reported ROIC being depressed by accounting convention.

**Peer comparison context:**
- Constellation Software (CSU.TO): ROIC >20% because they make many smaller acquisitions at lower multiples, so goodwill is proportionally less distortive. CSU.TO is the gold standard of serial acquirer capital allocation.
- Danaher (DHR): Similar goodwill distortion to Roper. Reported ROIC ~8% also below WACC if taken at face value.
- Halma (HLMA.L): Less goodwill-heavy, reported ROIC ~15%, but lower margins and slower growth than Roper.

## Amenazas al Moat

| Amenaza | Probabilidad | Impacto | Horizonte | Detalle |
|---------|-------------|---------|-----------|---------|
| AI disruption to vertical software | Baja-Media | Media | 5-10 anos | RBC downgraded on this risk. However: vertical software is deeply workflow-integrated and regulation-embedded. AI is more likely to enhance than replace (see CentralReach: 75% of bookings AI-enabled, Deltek "Della" AI assistant). The risk is if AI makes switching easier, not that AI replaces the software. Management says meaningful organic impact is a 2027+ story. |
| Deltek government spending headwinds (DOGE) | Media | Baja-Media | 1-2 anos | Temporary. Federal spending may shift but contractors still need DCAA-compliant ERP. Risk is volume (fewer contractors), not switching (existing customers leaving). |
| DAT freight cycle downturn | Media | Baja | 1-3 anos | Cyclical revenue pressure on DAT. Already reflected in stock (-44%). However, network effects strengthen during downturns (more brokers need DAT to find loads). DAT's acquisitions (Convoy, Trucker Tools, Outgo) position it for recovery. |
| Unanet competitive threat to Deltek | Baja-Media | Baja | 3-5 anos | Unanet gaining traction in SMB segment. But Costpoint dominance in mid/large contractors is secure. Migration cost for a $100M+ contractor is >$1M and 12+ months. |
| Acquisition discipline deterioration | Baja | Alta | 5+ anos | Roper has deployed $20B+ in acquisitions. If management team degrades or overpays, future returns decline. CEO Neil Hunn has been strong but succession risk exists. |
| Leverage risk | Baja-Media | Media | 2-5 anos | Net Debt/EBITDA at 2.9x is manageable but elevated. $9.3B debt limits acquisition capacity. However, $2.3B FCF/year provides rapid deleveraging. |
| Interest rate impact on valuation | Media | Media | 1-3 anos | Higher rates compress multiples for quality compounders. This is a valuation risk, not a moat risk. |

## Escenarios de Erosion

### 1. Most Probable: AI Reduces Software Switching Costs (15-20% probability, 5-10 year horizon)

If AI makes it trivially easy to migrate between vertical software platforms (automated data migration, instant retraining via AI assistants, regulatory compliance automation), the switching cost moat weakens significantly. However, this scenario requires:
- AI that understands the specific regulatory nuances of each vertical (DCAA, insurance compliance, legal billing rules)
- AI that can replicate years of customized workflows and institutional knowledge
- Customers willing to take migration risk in mission-critical systems

My assessment: AI will chip at the margins but not destroy the core switching cost moat. The regulatory complexity and mission-critical nature of these systems creates a "can't afford to get it wrong" mentality that preserves stickiness even as migration tools improve.

### 2. Tail Risk: Management Quality Degradation (5-10% probability, 5+ year horizon)

Roper's moat is partially dependent on continued disciplined capital allocation. If a future CEO abandons the CRI discipline, overpays for acquisitions, or enters competitive/commodity markets, the franchise erodes. This is the Danaher/GE risk -- great capital allocation models that depend on exceptional management.

Mitigant: The 30+ autonomous businesses have their own competitive positions. Even without new acquisitions, the existing portfolio compounds at ~5-6% organic growth with 25%+ FCF margins.

### 3. Tail Risk: Regulatory Disruption of Data Practices (5% probability, 3-5 year horizon)

Strata Decision's healthcare pricing data sharing has attracted antitrust scrutiny from The Capitol Forum. If regulators restrict data pooling in healthcare or freight, the network effects in those businesses weaken.

## Comparacion con Peers

| Metrica | ROP | CSU.TO | DHR | HLMA.L |
|---------|-----|--------|-----|--------|
| Moat Classification | WIDE | WIDE | WIDE | NARROW-WIDE |
| Primary Moat Source | Switching costs + Network effects | Switching costs | Switching costs + Intangibles | Switching costs + Regulation |
| Gross Margin | 70% | ~50% | ~60% | ~50% |
| EBITDA Margin | 40% | ~25% | ~30% | ~22% |
| FCF Margin | 25-29% | ~25% | ~20% | ~15% |
| Recurring Revenue % | 75-85% | ~75% | ~70% | ~50% |
| Organic Growth | 5-6% | ~20%+ | ~5% | ~7% |
| Capital Allocation | Excellent (CRI focus) | Best-in-class (VMS model) | Excellent (DBS) | Good (decentralized) |
| Debt/EBITDA | 2.9x | ~1x | ~2x | ~1x |
| Current P/E | 23.5x | 52.9x | 43.6x | 40.6x |

**Key takeaway:** Roper has the highest margins among peers, confirming the strength of its switching costs. CSU.TO has better organic growth and capital allocation, but trades at 2.3x Roper's multiple. Roper at 23.5x P/E is the cheapest quality serial acquirer in the group by a wide margin, reflecting the market's current skepticism about AI risk and near-term headwinds (Deltek/DAT).

## Moat Score Breakdown: 22/25

| Category | Score | Max | Reasoning |
|----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| **Switching Costs** | 9 | 10 | 95-98% retention, system-of-record in 30+ verticals, 3-7 year contracts, regulated workflow integration. Deducted 1 point for Unanet competitive pressure on Deltek SMB. |
| **Network Effects** | 5 | 5 | DAT is the definitive case. 700K daily load posts, $1T database, winner-take-most dynamics. Convoy/Trucker Tools acquisitions strengthen the flywheel. iTradeNetwork and iPipeline add cross-side network effects. |
| **Efficient Scale** | 4 | 5 | Multiple micro-niches are effectively duopolies or oligopolies (legal billing, insurance agency mgmt, campus cards). Deducted 1 for the Technology Enabled Products segment where scale advantages are weaker. |
| **Intangible Assets** | 3 | 3 | Deep domain expertise and regulatory know-how in each vertical. Not brand-based (B2B) but practically irreplaceable institutional knowledge. |
| **Durability** | 1 | 2 | Strong durability for 20+ years in software segments. Deducted 1 for AI uncertainty (low probability but non-zero) and Technology Products segment having shorter moat duration (~10-15 years). |

**Total: 22/25 -- WIDE MOAT**

## Moat Trayectoria: STABLE to SLIGHTLY EXPANDING

**Expanding factors:**
- DAT network effect strengthening via Convoy/Trucker Tools/Outgo acquisitions (2025)
- AI integration (CentralReach, Deltek Della) increasing product stickiness, not reducing it
- Cross-sell within verticals (Strata + Syntellis, CBORD + Transact) deepening customer relationships
- Recurring revenue mix increasing (from ~70% five years ago to 75-85% now)

**Stable factors:**
- Switching costs in core application software verticals remain extremely high
- No evidence of major customer churn in any segment
- Competitive positions in key duopolies (Vertafore/Applied, Aderant/Elite) unchanged

**Potential erosion factors:**
- Unanet gaining traction in SMB government contracting (not yet material)
- DAT cyclically pressured by weak freight market (temporary)
- Technology Enabled Products less moaty than software segments

**Net assessment:** STABLE with slight expansion from DAT ecosystem buildout and AI-enhancement of stickiness.

## Discrepancias con Thesis (si aplica)

No fundamental-analyst thesis exists yet for ROP. This moat assessment is the first independent analysis. Key findings for any future thesis:

1. **QS Tool shows 48 (Tier C) -- this is materially wrong.** The tool penalizes heavily for reported ROIC (5-7%) which is distorted by $19.3B goodwill (62% of assets). Adjusted ROIC ex-goodwill is ~35%. An adjusted QS would be in the range of 70-78 (Tier B to borderline Tier A). The thesis MUST show both scores with documented adjustment reasoning.

2. **EPS CAGR shows -30.7% -- misleading.** 2022 EPS of $42.92 included a one-time gain. Normalized EPS has grown from ~$12 (2020) to ~$20 (2025), representing ~11% CAGR. The tool picked up the anomalous 2022 figure.

3. **Leverage at 2.9x Net Debt/EBITDA needs context.** For a business generating $2.3B annual FCF with 75-85% recurring revenue, this is comfortable. The tool gives only 5/10 for leverage, which underweights the predictability of the cash flows.

## 🔄 META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres

1. **AI switching cost erosion -- genuine uncertainty.** I assessed this as low-medium probability, but it is the one factor that could structurally erode the Wide moat. If AI agents can seamlessly migrate between vertical software platforms in 5-10 years, the 95%+ retention rates could compress. I do not have enough evidence to quantify this risk precisely. My base case is that regulatory complexity and mission-criticality protect Roper's verticals more than, say, generic SaaS. But RBC's downgrade on this basis deserves respect.

2. **CRI metric is management-defined and unaudited.** Roper uses CRI (Cash Return on Investment) because standard ROIC is distorted by goodwill. While the logic is sound, CRI is a proprietary metric that management can define favorably. I could not independently verify the "500% cumulative" claim. The correct independent validation is to look at FCF margin (25-29%) and FCF growth (consistent), which are GAAP metrics and independently confirm exceptional economics.

3. **Strata Decision antitrust scrutiny.** The Capitol Forum flagged potential antitrust issues with Strata's healthcare pricing data sharing practices. I could not find a resolution or current status. If regulators restrict data pooling, this weakens the network effect in healthcare analytics.

4. **DAT market share -- no hard percentage found.** Multiple sources describe DAT as "the largest" freight marketplace in North America, but I could not find a specific market share percentage (e.g., "85%" as the task context suggested). The 700K daily load posts and $1T transaction database are the best available quantitative proxies. The competitive landscape description (DAT, Truckstop, Highway+Triumph as the three groups) suggests a market with 2-3 major players, consistent with oligopolistic dynamics.

### Sugerencias de Mejora

1. **quality_scorer.py needs serial acquirer adjustment.** For companies like ROP, DHR, CSU.TO where goodwill dominates the balance sheet, the ROIC calculation is meaningless. Suggestion: add a flag `--serial-acquirer` that calculates ROIC ex-goodwill or uses ROIC on tangible capital. This would prevent the tool from outputting misleading Tier C scores for Wide moat businesses.

2. **EPS anomaly detection in quality_scorer.py.** The tool picked up 2022 EPS of $42.92 (one-time gain) and calculated -30.7% EPS CAGR, which is economically wrong. Suggestion: add outlier detection for EPS (e.g., if one year's EPS is >2x the median of the surrounding 4 years, flag it and exclude from CAGR calculation).

### Anomalias Detectadas

1. **DHR and CSU.TO price_checker data looks wrong.** DHR shows yield 58.0% and CSU.TO shows yield 24.0%. These are almost certainly data errors from yfinance. DHR's actual yield is ~0.5% and CSU.TO's is ~0.1%. This does not affect the moat assessment but is worth noting for any valuation work.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator

1. Should the fundamental-analyst proceed with ROP given the QS tool limitation? My recommendation: YES, but the thesis must document the QS adjustment (tool 48 -> adjusted 70-78) with the goodwill reasoning above.
2. Given ROP at -44% from ATH and P/E 23.5x (cheapest quality serial acquirer), does the orchestrator want to fast-track the full buy-pipeline (R1-R4)?
3. Should I flag the quality_scorer.py serial acquirer issue for the quant-tools-dev agent?
