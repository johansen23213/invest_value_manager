## 10 Gates: ALL PASSED

### Gate 0: Sector View -- PASS
Sector view: `world/sectors/industrial-technology.md` (2026-02-12, NEUTRAL)

### Gate 1: Quality Score -- PASS (with caveat)
QS 70 (Tier B upper). +22 adjustment documented per-item:
- ROIC partial-goodwill: +8 (50% goodwill as capital, ROIC ~12%, spread +3pp)
- EPS CAGR correction: +5 (2022 one-time gain anomaly)
- ROIC Persistence: +3 (20+ year track record)
- Market Position: +6 (#1 in most niches, some competitive pressure)

### Gate 2: Business Understanding -- PASS
Portfolio of 29 #1 vertical software monopolies. 75-80% recurring, 70% GM, $2.47B FCF. Cheap (-44%) because DOGE/Deltek + DAT freight recession + SaaSpocalypse AI fear.

### Gate 3: Projection Fundamentals -- PASS
Revenue 7-9% total (5-6% organic + 2-3% M&A). WACC 8.0-8.5%. Bear $290 / Base $440 / Bull $590.

### Gate 4: Valuation Multi-Method -- PASS
FCF 17x ($394, 40%) + EV/EBITDA 20x ($403, 30%) + DCF 8.5% WACC ($360, 30%) = **$386** (validates R3 $385).

### Gate 5: Margin of Safety -- PASS (at $300 only)
22% MoS at $300. Current $334 = 13% = insufficient. -3.3% vs bear case $290.

### Gate 6: Macro Context -- PASS
Mid-cycle US. SaaSpocalypse ongoing but vertical software more defensible than horizontal. Zero tariff risk.

### Gate 7: Portfolio Fit -- PASS
0% current Industrial Tech exposure. LOW correlation with existing holdings. Cash post-purchase ~40%.

### Gate 8: Sector Understanding -- PASS
Sector view exists. TAM $50-60B growing 8-12%. ROP listed as high-priority target.

### Gate 9: Autocritica -- PASS
5 unvalidated assumptions documented. 4 biases acknowledged. 7 kill conditions defined.

### Gate 10: Counter-Analysis -- PASS (with residual risks)
DA verdict: MODERATE COUNTER (7/16 HIGH). Key conflicts RESOLVED in R3. Biggest unresolved: AI per-seat pricing (25% prob, 3-5yr).

## Kill Conditions

1. KC#1: Organic growth < 3% for 2 consecutive quarters
2. KC#2: Net revenue retention < 100% for 2 consecutive quarters
3. KC#3: Leverage > 3.5x without offsetting FCF growth
4. KC#4: Large acquisition (>$3B) while leverage > 2.5x
5. KC#5: DOGE budget with >20% civilian cuts AND Deltek revenue -15%+
6. KC#6: Goodwill write-down > $3B
7. KC#7: Per-seat pricing erosion >10% revenue in any major vertical

## Precedent-Setting Decisions

1. **Serial acquirer QS adjustment protocol:** +22 approved with per-item documentation. Max +20 without committee explicit approval. Applies to CSU.TO, DHR, TDG, HLMA.L, DPLM.L, JDG.L.

2. **Partial-goodwill ROIC exception:** For serial acquirers with goodwill >50% of assets, partial-goodwill ROIC (50% goodwill as capital) must show spread >+2pp vs WACC. ROP at +3pp PASSES. Does NOT override ROIC < WACC exit for non-serial-acquirers.

3. **Per-seat pricing risk:** New systemic risk for all software positions. KC#7 should be considered for ADBE, MONY.L, BYIT.L, PAYC, INTU.
