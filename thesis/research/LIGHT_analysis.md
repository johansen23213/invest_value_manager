# Signify NV (LIGHT.AS) - Investment Thesis

**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Price:** EUR 17.91
**Fair Value (Conservative Weighted):** EUR 26.73
**Margin of Safety:** 33%
**Recommendation:** BUY (small position, 3-4% max)

---

## Executive Summary

Signify NV is the global leader in lighting (ex-Philips Lighting), trading at historically depressed multiples (P/E 7.3x, EV/EBITDA 4.8x, FCF yield 18.6%) following a -6.2% revenue decline in 2025, margin compression, 900 job cuts announced Jan 30 2026, and refusal to provide 2026 revenue guidance. The stock dropped ~11.5% on Jan 30 alone.

**Core thesis:** The market is pricing Signify as a permanently declining legacy business. While real risks exist (commoditization, Chinese overcapacity, cyclical weakness), the valuation implies near-zero growth forever. Meanwhile, connected lighting (~30% of revenue, growing), strong FCF generation (EUR 399M, 6.9% of revenue), a sustainable dividend (47% of FCF), and a floor valuation from EPV of EUR 20.86 suggest meaningful upside even in a no-growth scenario.

**This is a cyclical trough play with option value from connected/smart lighting transition, NOT a secular growth story.**

## Valuation (3 Methods)

### Method 1: FCF-Based DCF (10-year)

| Scenario | Assumptions | Fair Value | MoS |
|----------|-------------|------------|-----|
| Bear | FCF declining 3%/yr then flat, WACC 10% | EUR 21.39 | 16% |
| Base | FCF flat then 3% growth, WACC 9% | EUR 37.10 | 52% |
| Bull | FCF growing 3% then 5%, WACC 8.5% | EUR 54.51 | 67% |

### Method 2: EPV (Earnings Power Value - No Growth)

- Normalized EBIT (haircutted 15%): EUR 414M
- NOPAT at 25% tax: EUR 311M
- EPV per share: **EUR 20.86** (14% above current price)
- This is the FLOOR value assuming zero growth forever

### Method 3: Peer Multiples

| Multiple | Low | Mid | High |
|----------|-----|-----|------|
| EV/EBITDA (5.5-8.5x) | 22.0 | 30.2 | 38.4 |
| P/FCF (8-12x) | 26.7 | 33.4 | 40.1 |
| P/E (8-12x) | 17.0 | 21.3 | 25.5 |

### Conservative Weighted Fair Value

- 35% Bear DCF + 35% Base DCF + 30% EPV = **EUR 26.73**
- Margin of Safety at EUR 17.91: **33%** (exceeds 25% threshold)

## Moat Assessment: NARROW (under pressure)

### Sources of Competitive Advantage

1. **Brand (Philips license):** Strong brand recognition in professional and consumer lighting. Philips brand licensed until ~2030. Significant switching costs in large-scale professional installations.

2. **Scale:** Global #1 with EUR 5.8B revenue. Manufacturing footprint across 28+ countries. Economies of scale in sourcing, R&D, and distribution that smaller competitors cannot match.

3. **Patent portfolio:** Active IP enforcement (e.g., April 2025 litigation vs Nanoleaf). Licensing revenue stream. Defends margins in connected lighting segment.

4. **Installed base:** 153 million connected light points (Q1 2025). Creates lock-in via software ecosystem (Interact, Hue). Recurring revenue potential from services/subscriptions.

5. **Connected lighting position:** ~30% of revenue from connected/smart lighting. Growing segment with higher margins. AI-driven features (Hue generative AI assistant, GrowWise horticulture). This is where the moat is WIDENING.

### Moat Erosion Risks

- Commoditization of basic LED products (most of the market)
- Chinese overcapacity driving price pressure globally
- Conventional lighting in structural decline
- ROE of 8.6% barely above cost of capital -- moat is NOT earning excess returns currently

**Verdict:** Narrow moat with optionality. The connected lighting business has a legitimate moat (ecosystem lock-in, patents, scale). The legacy business has a deteriorating moat. The question is whether connected grows fast enough to offset legacy decline.

## Dividend Sustainability

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Dividend per share | EUR 1.57 (2026) | +0.6% YoY |
| Yield at EUR 17.91 | 8.8% | |
| Payout vs FCF | 47% | SUSTAINABLE |
| Payout vs Net Income | 74% | STRETCHED |
| Company target | 40-50% of NI | Currently above target |
| FCF coverage | 2.1x | Comfortable |
| Track record | Paid/increased since IPO | Consistent |

**Assessment:** Dividend is sustainable from FCF perspective. The payout ratio vs net income (74%) exceeds the company's stated 40-50% target, but management has signaled commitment to progressive dividend. If earnings decline further, a cut is possible but not imminent given strong FCF generation. At worst, dividend stays flat for 1-2 years.

**Key risk:** EUR 400M bond maturity in December 2026. Must be refinanced. Should be manageable but worth monitoring.

## Risk Assessment

### High-Impact Risks

1. **Structural decline / value trap (MEDIUM-HIGH probability)**
   - If LED lighting fully commoditizes, Signify becomes a shrinking business
   - Revenue has declined 3 consecutive years (7,514 -> 6,704 -> 6,143 -> 5,765)
   - Management cannot even provide 2026 revenue guidance
   - MITIGANT: Connected lighting growing, FCF remains strong, company is adapting

2. **Chinese overcapacity (HIGH probability)**
   - Chinese manufacturers redirecting product from US (tariffs) to Europe
   - Intense price pressure in professional trade channels
   - MITIGANT: Signify competing on systems/services, not just hardware

3. **Margin compression (MEDIUM-HIGH probability)**
   - EBITA margin guided 7.5-8.5% for 2026 (vs 8.9% in 2025)
   - Cost restructuring (900 jobs) may not be enough
   - MITIGANT: Cost actions + mix shift to higher-margin connected

4. **Debt refinancing (MEDIUM probability)**
   - EUR 400M maturing Dec 2026, EUR 325M in Aug 2028
   - Higher rates increase interest expense
   - MITIGANT: Strong FCF, investment-grade credit

### Medium-Impact Risks

5. **Philips brand license expiration (~2030)** - Would lose a key brand asset
6. **Macro/construction cycle** - Lighting demand tied to construction/renovation
7. **US tariff escalation** - North America is largest revenue region
8. **Management execution** - Capital Markets Day mid-2026 will be critical

### Low-Impact Risks

9. **Technology disruption** - OLED, laser lighting (very long-term)
10. **Currency** - EUR reporting but global revenue

## Why Is It Cheap? (Bear Case Steelman)

The market is not stupid. Here is why Signify trades at 4.8x EV/EBITDA:

1. **Revenue declining for 3 years** with no guidance for 2026 -- this is NOT a growth company
2. **Margin compression** -- EBITA margin falling from ~10% to guided 7.5-8.5%
3. **Chinese overcapacity** flooding global markets with cheap LEDs
4. **ROE of 8.6%** barely covers cost of capital -- not earning excess returns
5. **Legacy transition risk** -- conventional lighting still ~70% of revenue, declining
6. **Construction cycle weakness** -- no near-term catalyst
7. **900 more job cuts** -- signal of ongoing distress

**Counter-argument:** The market is pricing permanent decline. But FCF of EUR 399M vs market cap of EUR 2.14B means you get your money back in ~5.4 years even with ZERO growth. Connected lighting at 30% of revenue is growing and has better margins. The company is generating cash, returning it to shareholders, and has a viable path through the transition.

---

## Autocritica

**Assumptions I am making:**
- FCF stays above EUR 350M/yr (could compress with margins)
- Connected lighting reaches 40-50% of revenue by 2030
- Dividend maintained or grows modestly
- No major technological disruption in lighting

**Biases detected:**
- Attraction to low multiples (classic value trap bait)
- Assuming "global #1" means competitive advantage (scale != moat if commodity product)

**Evidence I might be ignoring:**
- Revenue decline is ACCELERATING (-3.4% comparable in 2025 vs prior years)
- Management's refusal to guide 2026 revenue is a red flag
- 900 job cuts suggest the situation may worsen before improving

**Validation:**
- FCF data confirmed via yfinance historical financials
- Dividend confirmed via multiple sources
- Revenue trend consistent across yfinance and Signify IR

## Decision: CONDITIONAL BUY

**Fair Value:** EUR 26.73 (conservative weighted)
**Margin of Safety:** 33% (passes >25% threshold)
**Moat:** Narrow (passes minimum requirement)
**Risks:** Well-identified and manageable at this price

### Position Sizing

Given the uncertainty (no 2026 guidance, margin compression, value trap risk), I recommend a **SMALL initial position**:

- **Available cash:** EUR 6,547
- **Recommended allocation:** 3% of portfolio = depends on total portfolio size
- **Maximum position:** EUR ~500-700 (small starter)
- **Entry strategy:** Buy small now at EUR 17.91 (near 52-week low), with option to add after:
  - Q1 2026 results (if FCF holds up)
  - Capital Markets Day mid-2026 (strategic clarity)

### Catalysts to Watch

- **Capital Markets Day (mid-2026):** Strategic review could unlock value (separation of businesses?)
- **Connected lighting inflection:** If connected reaches 35%+ of revenue with improving margins
- **Construction cycle recovery:** European/US infrastructure spending
- **Cost restructuring benefits:** 900 job cuts should flow through in H2 2026

### Kill Triggers (SELL if)

- FCF drops below EUR 300M/yr (thesis broken)
- Dividend cut (signals management lost confidence)
- Connected lighting growth stalls
- Debt refinancing at prohibitive rates
- Revenue decline accelerates past -10% comparable

## Comparable Company Context

| Company | EV/EBITDA | P/E | FCF Yield | Div Yield |
|---------|-----------|-----|-----------|-----------|
| **Signify** | **4.8x** | **7.3x** | **18.6%** | **8.8%** |
| Acuity Brands | ~14x | ~20x | ~5% | 0.3% |
| Hubbell | ~16x | ~22x | ~4% | 1.2% |
| Legrand | ~14x | ~22x | ~5% | 2.0% |

Signify trades at a massive discount to peers. Some discount is warranted (slower growth, European exposure, transition risk), but NOT a 60-70% discount.
