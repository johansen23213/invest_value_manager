# Counter-Analysis: INTU (Intuit Inc.)

## Fecha: 2026-02-13
## Counter-Analysis Score: 14/19 (STRONG COUNTER)

> **CRITICAL FLAG FOR ORCHESTRATOR:** The thesis significantly understates two material risks: (1) SBC consumes ~39% of reported FCF, making the "5.4% OEY" headline metric misleading -- true OEY is ~3.7%, and (2) the per-seat pricing model across QuickBooks is structurally exposed to the SaaSpocalypse, which the thesis dismisses as "net positive for Intuit." These two factors combined reduce FV from $465 to ~$365-385 and push the appropriate entry to $270-310.

## Resumen Ejecutivo

The thesis presents Intuit as a Quality Compounder trading at a compelling discount. While the business quality is genuine -- QuickBooks' dominance and switching costs are real -- the thesis suffers from three systematic flaws: (1) it values the company on headline FCF that is inflated by $1.97B of SBC, producing a 5.4% OEY that is actually ~3.7% on an SBC-adjusted basis; (2) it dismisses AI disruption as "net positive" when Intuit is simultaneously paying $100M to the company most likely to disrupt it; and (3) it treats the 90/0 insider selling ratio as "mostly pre-planned" when the total absence of buying at -50% from highs is the most bearish signal insiders can legally send. The thesis survives, but the fair value should be $365-385 (not $465), the QS should be 70-72 (Tier B, not Tier A), and entry should be $270-310 (not $330-365).

## Asunciones Clave Desafiadas

### 1. "OEY 5.4% + Growth 11% = 16.4% -- very attractive for Tier A"

- **Evidencia en contra:** The thesis calculates OEY using headline FCF of $6.1B. But Intuit's SBC was $1.97B in FY2025 (source: MacroTrends, risk-identifier report). SBC is a real economic cost -- it dilutes shareholders and is functionally equivalent to paying employees in cash and then issuing shares to raise that cash. Adjusting FCF for SBC: $6.1B - $1.97B = $4.13B. Owner Earnings ex-SBC = $4.13B - $1.1B (maintenance capex) + $1.0B (depreciation addback) = $4.03B. True OEY = $4.03B / $111.3B market cap = **3.6%, not 5.4%**. True OEY + Growth = 3.6% + 11% = 14.6%, not 16.4%. This is still above WACC (9.7%) but the spread narrows from 6.7pp to 4.9pp -- significantly less attractive. Furthermore, when the thesis compares INTU favorably to ADBE (16.5%) and NVO (14.8%), it is making an apples-to-oranges comparison: ADBE's SBC is ~6% of revenue vs INTU's ~10%, meaning ADBE's FCF quality is materially better. The P/FCF ratio the market sees is 18x on headline FCF but 27x on SBC-adjusted FCF -- which is NOT cheap for a company with 40-45% seasonal revenue concentration.
- **Severidad:** **HIGH**
- **Resolucion sugerida:** The committee must recalculate the OEY-based FV using SBC-adjusted FCF. At 4.5% OEY target, FV = $4.03B / 0.045 / 278M shares = ~$322/share (not $480). Weight the OEY at 60% and adjust the blended FV downward by approximately 15-20%.

### 2. "AI is NET POSITIVE for Intuit, not a threat"

- **Evidencia en contra:** The thesis assigns only 20% probability that AI disruption materializes. This underestimates the speed of change. Key evidence:
  - **Altruist Hazel launch (Feb 10, 2026):** An AI platform that can read 1040s, pay stubs, and account statements, generating tax strategies in minutes. This triggered an 11% single-day drop in INTU. The thesis was written Feb 12 but does not mention this specific event.
  - **SaaSpocalypse ($285B wiped Feb 3):** The per-seat pricing model is under existential threat. Anthropic's Claude Cowork demonstrated autonomous task handling across business software -- if one AI agent replaces 10 seats, QuickBooks per-seat pricing collapses. The thesis does not address the per-seat exposure despite system MEMORY flagging this risk for all software positions (KC#7).
  - **Scale Venture Partners published research showing LLMs can "build TurboTax in a weekend"** -- this is referenced in the risk assessment but not in the thesis proper.
  - **The $100M OpenAI deal is DEFENSIVE, not offensive.** The risk-identifier correctly identified this: "Intuit is paying the disruptor to not disrupt them yet." The thesis frames it as "Intuit chose to PARTNER with AI" -- this is spin, not analysis.
  - **Wells Fargo downgrade (Jan 2026):** Cut from Overweight to Equal Weight specifically citing "elevated expectations" and AI disruption concerns. TD Cowen cut target to $658 citing "investor hesitation around AI impacts and terminal values."
  - **Probability reassessment:** AI disruption is not binary. The gradual erosion of per-seat pricing, commoditization of simple tax returns, and AI-native bookkeeping tools represent a continuum of degradation, not a single event. I estimate 35-45% probability of material impact within 3-5 years (vs thesis's 20%).
- **Severidad:** **HIGH**
- **Resolucion sugerida:** Increase bear case probability from 25% to 35%. Add explicit per-seat pricing erosion as Kill Condition #8. Increase WACC by 0.5pp to reflect heightened disruption risk. This alone reduces base FV by ~$30-40.

### 3. "Insider selling -- PARTIALLY pre-planned, PARTIALLY concerning"

- **Evidencia en contra:** The thesis admits 90 sales / 0 purchases over 6 months, $255M sold in 3 months, but then partially rationalizes it with "most sales under Rule 10b5-1 plans." Independent research confirms:
  - **Scott Cook sold $100M+ in the final days of 2025** (Dec 29-31). Two transactions: $50.5M on Dec 29 and $50.3M on Dec 30. He then sold another 1,402 shares on Dec 31. This is concentrated selling, not routine diversification.
  - **Cook's sales were at ~$668/share** (Dec 2025 prices) -- meaning he sold at prices 67% HIGHER than the current $398. He was selling aggressively at prices far above where the thesis recommends buying.
  - **Zero insider buying at -50%:** The thesis notes this is "notable" but does not assign appropriate weight. When a stock falls 50% and NOT A SINGLE insider buys, this is the most bearish signal management can legally send without breaking insider trading laws. If management believed the stock was undervalued at $400, the cheapest, most powerful bullish signal would be buying $50K of stock. They have not done so.
  - **CEO Sasan Goodarzi sold "only 3.6% of holdings"** per the thesis -- but 3.6% of his holdings is still millions of dollars in net selling at the top.
- **Severidad:** **HIGH**
- **Resolucion sugerida:** The committee should treat the insider selling pattern as a -3 to -5 point QS adjustment under Capital Allocation. The thesis already applied -5 forward-looking but only partially attributed it to insider selling. This is a quantitative red flag that should increase the required MoS by 3-5pp.

### 4. "Mailchimp concern is valid but QUANTIFIED -- 6% of revenue, manageable"

- **Evidencia en contra:** The thesis quantifies Mailchimp at "~6% of revenue" and calls a potential impairment "manageable." Independent research reveals a more complex picture:
  - **Mailchimp was acquired for $12B in November 2021** at PEAK SaaS valuations. Revenue has declined in recent quarters. Seeking Alpha (Aug 2025): "Intuit Stock Keeps Overdelivering, But Mailchimp Doesn't."
  - **Excluding Mailchimp, GBS grew 20% and Online Ecosystem grew 25%.** Including Mailchimp, GBS grew only 16%. This is a 400bps drag, not the 150bps the thesis cites.
  - **Goodwill from acquisitions = $14B, ~76% of equity.** The risk assessment correctly identifies this but the thesis does not integrate it into the valuation. If Mailchimp requires even a partial impairment ($3-5B), it wipes out 1-2 quarters of GAAP earnings and signals capital misallocation.
  - **Email marketing is being commoditized by AI.** Competitors HubSpot and ConvertKit are eating into Mailchimp's base. The CFO acknowledges Mailchimp is "a near-term drag on growth."
  - **The thesis says "Mailchimp drags GBS growth by 150bps."** The actual figure from Q1 FY26 reporting shows a larger gap: GBS ex-Mailchimp grew 20% vs GBS total 16% = **400bps drag**, not 150bps. This is either a thesis error or selective citation.
- **Severidad:** **MODERATE**
- **Resolucion sugerida:** Apply a $1-2B capital allocation penalty to the valuation (impairment risk discount). Increase the goodwill-related kill condition probability. If Mailchimp revenue declines >10% in FY26, trigger a thesis review.

### 5. "QS 75 Adjusted -- Tier A borderline"

- **Evidencia en contra:** The thesis adjusts QS from 77 (tool) to 75 (adjusted), a net -2 change. I believe the adjustment is insufficient:
  - **Market position +8 is generous.** While INTU is #1 in US DIY tax and US SMB accounting, the tool default of 0 reflects the tool's known limitation (market_position needs manual input). The +8 is reasonable for current share, but forward-looking, TurboTax's 60% share is under pressure from AI and QBO's 80% US share may face per-seat erosion. A forward-looking adjustment of +6 (not +8) is more appropriate.
  - **SBC distortion not reflected.** SBC at 39% of FCF means the "FCF Margin 32.3%" that scores 10/10 is inflated. FCF margin ex-SBC is approximately 21.9%, which scores 10/10 still but is materially different economically.
  - **ROIC trajectory distorted by acquisitions.** The tool shows 4 years: 10%, 12.2%, 15%, 17.2%. But this is RECOVERY from acquisition-inflated capital, not improvement. Pre-acquisition ROIC was 20%+. The current 17.2% is BELOW the pre-acquisition level. The ROIC persistence score should not improve as the company merely recovers from its own capital allocation decisions.
  - **Insider ownership 2.3% is LOW** for a founder-led company. Scott Cook is a director, not an employee. The CEO has been a net seller. At 2.3%, insiders have limited skin in the game.
  - **Forward QS reassessment:** +6 (market position, not +8) - 5 (ROIC forward/insider) - 2 (SBC quality) = net +(-1). QS Adjusted: 77 - 1 = **76, still borderline Tier A.** However, accounting for the per-seat pricing risk and AI disruption timeline, a further -4 to -6 points is warranted for forward-looking moat erosion, yielding QS 70-72 (Tier B).
- **Severidad:** **MODERATE**
- **Resolucion sugerida:** The committee should classify INTU as Tier B (QS 70-72, not 75) which changes the required MoS from 15-25% (Tier A precedent) to 20-30% (Tier B precedent). At Tier B, the entry calculation shifts materially downward.

### Negocio

| # | Desafio | Evidencia | Severidad |
|---|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Per-seat pricing model structurally exposed to SaaSpocalypse | $285B wiped from SaaS on Feb 3 2026. QBO charges per user; AI agents reduce headcount = fewer seats. QBO Desktop Plus pricing $1,049 + $310/user-seat/yr. | **HIGH** |
| 2 | AI disruption is NOT net positive -- $100M OpenAI deal is defensive spend | Risk-identifier: "paying the disruptor to delay disruption." Altruist Hazel (Feb 10) triggered 11% single-day drop. Scale VP: "build TurboTax in a weekend" | **HIGH** |
| 3 | Mailchimp acquisition underperforming worse than thesis states | 400bps drag on GBS (not 150bps as thesis claims). Revenue declining. $12B acquisition at peak valuations. Email marketing being commoditized by AI. | **MODERATE** |
| 4 | QuickBooks Desktop end-of-life creates migration churn window | Desktop 2023 EOL May 2026, Desktop 2024 EOL May 2027. Forced migration gives Xero/FreshBooks their best acquisition window in decades. | **LOW** |
| 5 | TurboTax market share flat/slightly declining (1pp YoY loss) | Moat assessment confirms 60% share with 1pp decline. AI + free filing alternatives growing. "37% of taxpayers qualify for TurboTax Free" = significant free tier burden. | **MODERATE** |

### Valoracion

| # | Desafio | Evidencia | Severidad |
|---|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 6 | OEY calculated on headline FCF inflated by $1.97B SBC | True OEY = 3.6%, not 5.4%. P/FCF(adj) = 27x, not 18x. The thesis's comparison with ADBE/NVO is apples-to-oranges. | **HIGH** |
| 7 | DCF Net Debt anomaly acknowledged but not corrected in FV | Thesis notes tool shows $0 net debt when reality is ~$2.4B. This reduces all DCF FVs by ~$9/share. Small but systemic. | **LOW** |
| 8 | OEY-implied FV methodology is internally inconsistent | Thesis calculates OEY FV at "4.5% yield = $480" but then says "at 5.0% OEY = $431." The range $430-540 is absurdly wide for a "primary method." This is not precision -- it is uncertainty masquerading as a range. | **MODERATE** |
| 9 | Bear case is not bearish enough | Thesis bear = $330 (P/E 22x). But the SaaSpocalypse scenario implies P/E 14-18x if growth decelerates to 6-8%. At $14.50 EPS x 18x = $261. At 15x = $218. The thesis's "bear" is actually a "mild disappointment" case. | **HIGH** |
| 10 | Analyst consensus price targets ($798 average) creates false comfort | Wall Street analysts are ALWAYS lagging when a secular shift occurs. The $798 average target was set before the SaaSpocalypse. Goldman initiated "Neutral" at $720 -- which implies significant downside risk. | **MODERATE** |

### Riesgos

| # | Desafio | Evidencia | Severidad |
|---|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 11 | Correlated risk cascade not modeled | AI disruption + growth deceleration + goodwill impairment + P/E compression are highly correlated. A single catalyst (AI advancement) triggers all four simultaneously. Thesis treats them as independent probabilities. | **HIGH** |
| 12 | SBC as % of FCF not flagged as kill condition | At 39% of FCF, SBC is consuming nearly half of the cash flow that the OEY valuation is based on. If SBC rises to 45%+ (which it could as Intuit competes for AI talent), the entire OEY framework breaks down. | **MODERATE** |
| 13 | Goodwill at 76% of equity with $12B Mailchimp underperforming | Risk-identifier rates this HIGH. The thesis acknowledges but does not adjust FV for impairment probability. A 25% probability of $3B impairment = $750M expected loss = ~$2.70/share haircut. | **MODERATE** |
| 14 | Kill condition #7 (IRS Direct File) is administration-dependent | Killed under Trump but could return under future admin. The thesis treats this as "removed threat" but it is merely "deferred threat." A 4-year election cycle means this risk returns in 2029 at latest. | **LOW** |

### Timing

| # | Desafio | Evidencia | Severidad |
|---|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 15 | Q2 FY2026 earnings in 13 days (Feb 26) -- why not wait? | The thesis recommends waiting, which is correct. But the standing order at $365 (22% MoS) is too aggressive given the risks identified above. Post-Q2 entry should be contingent on SBC-adjusted OEY > 4.5% and confirmation that per-seat pricing is intact. | **MODERATE** |
| 16 | SaaSpocalypse is ONGOING -- sector-wide P/E compression not done | The $285B wipeout was Feb 3. INTU has continued to fall. Morgan Stanley SaaS index worst start since 2022. No one knows where the bottom is. Buying into an accelerating sector selloff requires higher conviction than the thesis provides. | **HIGH** |
| 17 | The market may be smarter than us on AI disruption timing | INTU fell 51% from highs. The thesis says "market over-reacting." But when HRB was sold from our portfolio at -13.25%, the market was RIGHT about AI disruption (STRONG COUNTER 18/24). What makes INTU different? The thesis says "ecosystem" -- but HRB also had ecosystem (assisted + DIY). | **MODERATE** |

## Conflictos con Otros Analisis

### Thesis vs Risk Assessment

The risk-identifier produced a **MEDIUM-HIGH** risk score with 5 HIGH-rated risks and explicitly noted correlated risk cascade. The thesis, by contrast, rates conviction as "High (conditional on entry price)" and frames risk as manageable. The risk assessment's FCF figure ("reported FCF of ~$5.1B") conflicts with the thesis's "$6.1B" -- likely different fiscal periods, but the discrepancy is not reconciled. The risk assessment's DCF base case ($384) is 17% below the thesis's ($465) -- a massive divergence that the thesis does not explain.

### Thesis vs Moat Assessment

The moat assessment rates TurboTax switching costs as "moderate and somewhat fragile" and notes "TurboTax moat is narrower." The thesis, however, builds 25% of revenue on TurboTax and treats it as part of a unified "deep moat" without disaggregating the moat quality by segment. The moat assessment explicitly warns: "If TurboTax moat erodes significantly, the company-level moat could narrow to NARROW despite QuickBooks strength." This warning is not reflected in the thesis's FV.

### Thesis Internal Inconsistency

The thesis states "Q1 FY2026 showed 18% revenue growth" and uses this to support 11% base case growth. But the risk assessment notes this was SLOWER than Q4 FY25 (+20%), meaning growth is decelerating quarter-over-quarter. The thesis frames 18% as "AHEAD of full-year guidance" (which is true) but omits that it is BEHIND the previous quarter (which is the concerning trend).

### Mailchimp Drag Discrepancy

The thesis claims Mailchimp drags GBS growth by "150bps (management disclosed)." The actual Q1 FY26 data shows GBS grew 16% total vs 20% ex-Mailchimp = 400bps drag. The 150bps figure may be from a different period, but the thesis does not specify or reconcile this. This is either a thesis error or selective citation.

### Score Breakdown (19 points maximum)

| Category | Max Points | Points Awarded | Reasoning |
|----------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Business Model Challenges | 4 | 3 | Per-seat pricing risk is real and unaddressed. AI defensive spending acknowledged. Mailchimp worse than thesis claims. QBO desktop migration is minor. |
| Valuation Challenges | 5 | 4 | SBC-adjusted OEY demolishes the headline metric. Bear case not bearish enough. OEY methodology internally inconsistent. Net debt anomaly is minor. |
| Risk Challenges | 5 | 4 | Correlated risk cascade is the most dangerous finding. SBC kill condition missing. Goodwill impairment not priced. IRS risk deferred but not eliminated. |
| Timing Challenges | 3 | 2 | SaaSpocalypse ongoing and accelerating. HRB precedent is cautionary. Waiting for Q2 is correct but standing order too aggressive. |
| QS/Thesis Integrity | 2 | 1 | QS should be 70-72 (Tier B), not 75 (Tier A). Mailchimp drag figure incorrect. |
| **Total** | **19** | **14** | **STRONG COUNTER** |

### Interpretacion

STRONG COUNTER does NOT mean "do not buy." It means the thesis has material gaps that must be resolved before approval:

1. **FV must be recalculated on SBC-adjusted FCF.** Corrected FV range: $365-385 (vs thesis $465).
2. **QS should be re-evaluated as Tier B (70-72)**, not Tier A (75). This changes required MoS and entry price.
3. **Entry price should be $270-310** (vs thesis $330-365) to account for:
   - SBC-adjusted lower FV ($365-385 base)
   - Tier B MoS requirement (20-30%)
   - Per-seat pricing structural risk
   - Correlated risk cascade
4. **Per-seat pricing erosion must be added as Kill Condition #8.**
5. **Bear case must be stress-tested further** -- the thesis bear ($330) is above my entry range, meaning the thesis offers no MoS vs its own bear case at the proposed entry price.

## FV Challenge: Corrected Fair Value

| Method | Thesis FV | DA-Corrected FV | Change |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| OEY (SBC-adjusted, 4.0% yield) | $480 | $362 | -24.6% |
| DCF Base (11% growth, 10.2% WACC) | $457 | $420 | -8.1% |
| DCF Base (corrected net debt -$9) | -- | $411 | -- |
| **Weighted (60/40)** | **$465** | **$385** | **-17.2%** |

At corrected FV $385:
- Current price $398 = **MoS -3.4%** (OVERVALUED)
- Entry at $310 = **MoS 19.5%** (acceptable for Tier B)
- Entry at $290 = **MoS 24.7%** (within Tier B precedent range)
- Entry at $270 = **MoS 29.9%** (strong for Tier B)

## QS Challenge: Corrected Quality Score

| Component | Thesis | DA Correction | Reasoning |
|-----------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Financial Quality | 33/40 | 30/40 | -3 for SBC quality distortion of FCF margin |
| Growth Quality | 21/25 | 19/25 | -2 for growth deceleration trajectory (18% Q1 < 20% Q4) |
| Moat Evidence | 15/25 (+8 manual) = 23/25 | 19/25 (+6 manual) | +6 not +8 for market position (forward AI risk) |
| Capital Allocation | 8/10 | 5/10 | -3 for insider selling pattern + Mailchimp capital destruction |
| **Total** | **75** | **73** → **70-72 adj** | **Tier B (not Tier A)** |

Forward-looking QS adjustment: -2 to -3 additional for per-seat pricing structural risk = **QS 70-72 (Tier B)**

## Entry Price Challenge

| Scenario | Price | MoS vs DA FV ($385) | DA Recommendation |
|----------|-------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Current ($398) | -- | -3.4% | **DO NOT BUY** |
| Thesis entry ($365) | -- | 5.2% | **INSUFFICIENT MoS for Tier B** |
| Thesis entry ($330) | -- | 14.3% | **BELOW Tier B minimum precedent** |
| DA entry ($310) | -- | 19.5% | **Minimum acceptable entry** |
| DA entry ($290) | -- | 24.7% | **Good entry for Tier B** |
| DA entry ($270) | -- | 29.9% | **Strong entry** |

## Kill Conditions: Additions Required

In addition to the thesis's 7 kill conditions, I recommend adding:

8. **Per-seat pricing erosion >10% at QBO (measured by ARPU decline net of price increases) for 2 consecutive quarters** -- Signals structural SaaSpocalypse impact materializing.

9. **SBC exceeds 12% of revenue for a full fiscal year** -- Talent retention costs becoming unsustainable.

10. **Total insider selling exceeds $500M in any rolling 12-month period with zero insider purchases** -- Management has lost confidence.

## Recomendacion al Investment Committee

Before approving any INTU standing order or BUY, the committee MUST:

1. **Resolve the SBC/FCF quality issue.** Is the OEY based on headline FCF or SBC-adjusted FCF? If headline, the entire valuation framework overstates intrinsic value by 15-25%.

2. **Determine the correct QS tier.** If QS is 70-72 (Tier B), the valuation methodology changes from OEY + Reverse DCF (Tier A) to DCF + EV/EBIT (Tier B). This is not cosmetic -- it changes the primary valuation method.

3. **Quantify per-seat pricing risk.** QBO has ~7M subscribers. If AI reduces average seats per subscriber by 15-20% over 3 years, what is the revenue impact? This must be modeled explicitly, not waved away as "AI is net positive."

4. **Reconcile the risk assessment FV ($384) with the thesis FV ($465).** The 17% divergence between two analysts in our own system is a red flag that one of them is wrong.

5. **Wait for Q2 FY26 earnings (Feb 26).** The thesis recommends this correctly. Do NOT place a standing order before earnings. Tax season guidance will clarify AI impact on Consumer revenue.

6. **Set the standing order at $290-310, not $330-365.** At the corrected FV of $385, a $365 entry offers only 5% MoS, which is wildly insufficient for a Tier B company facing structural disruption risk.

## META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres
- **SBC adjustment magnitude.** My correction treats 100% of SBC as a real economic cost. Some argue that buybacks offsetting dilution mean the net cost is lower. For INTU, buybacks mostly offset dilution (shares flat YoY) but don't CREATE per-share value -- they merely prevent destruction. I believe 100% deduction is appropriate but acknowledge the debate exists.
- **AI disruption timeline is inherently uncertain.** I assign 35-45% probability to material impact in 3-5 years, vs thesis's 20%. The truth could be anywhere. If AI disruption takes 7+ years, my adjustments are too harsh and the thesis FV is closer to correct.
- **Altruist Hazel's actual market impact.** The Feb 10 announcement caused an 11% drop in financial stocks, but Hazel is priced at $125/seat/month for advisors -- this is a B2B tool, not a consumer tax filing replacement. My concern is more about the NARRATIVE it creates than the direct competitive threat.
- **Mailchimp drag figure.** I found 400bps (GBS 16% vs ex-Mailchimp 20%) from Q1 FY26, but the thesis cites 150bps "management disclosed." I could not find the exact management quote for 150bps -- it may be from a different period or metric. This needs verification.

### Limitaciones de Este Analisis
- I could not access Intuit's full 10-K filing to verify exact SBC figures, goodwill breakdown by reporting unit, or segment-level FCF.
- I could not find specific QBO churn/retention data -- Intuit does not publicly disclose this. My inference of ">90% retention" follows the thesis and moat assessment, but it is an assumption.
- Per-seat pricing impact is theoretical at this point. No public data exists on how many QBO users are actually reducing seats due to AI automation. This risk is forward-looking and currently unquantifiable.
- The SaaSpocalypse is an ongoing event. Market conditions are changing daily. My analysis reflects data through Feb 13, 2026.

### Sugerencias para el Sistema
- **Create SBC-adjusted FCF as standard metric in quality_scorer.py.** For all software companies, headline FCF is misleading. This is the risk-identifier's suggestion #2 and I strongly endorse it.
- **Add per-seat pricing risk to the standard risk-identifier checklist** for all software/SaaS positions (ADBE, BYIT.L, INTU, PAYC, ROP).
- **Fix quality_scorer.py Net Debt detection.** Both the thesis and the risk assessment flagged that the tool shows "Net Cash" for INTU when reality is ~$2.4B net debt. This may be affecting other companies.
- **Develop a "correlated risk cascade" framework.** When multiple risks share a common trigger (AI advancement in this case), their probabilities should be modeled as correlated, not independent. Joint probability is higher than the product of independent probabilities.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator
1. **Should INTU be classified as Tier B (QS 70-72) rather than Tier A (75)?** This changes the entire valuation methodology and required MoS. The difference between $365 entry (Tier A) and $290 entry (Tier B) is $75/share -- material.
2. **Do we have a policy on SBC-adjusted FCF for OEY calculations?** If not, we need one. Every software company in our pipeline (ADBE, PAYC, INTU, BYIT.L) is affected.
3. **Given STRONG COUNTER at 14/19, and the HRB precedent (18/24 STRONG COUNTER led to SELL at -13.25% loss), should we treat the STRONG COUNTER score as a higher bar for entry?** MORN also received 13/19 STRONG COUNTER and had FV cut 12%. The adversarial pattern continues.
4. **The risk assessment and thesis FVs diverge by 17% ($384 vs $465). Which one is the committee's base case?** My corrected FV of $385 aligns closely with the risk assessment's $384, not the thesis's $465.
