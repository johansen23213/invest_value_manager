## 1. POSITION SNAPSHOT (Research Pipeline)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current Price | $397.96 (Feb 13) |
| QS Tool | 77/100 (Tier A) |
| QS Adjusted | 75/100 (Tier A borderline) |
| Working FV | $465 (R1 thesis, NO adversarial yet) |
| Entry Target | $350 (20-25% MoS) |
| Distance to Entry | 13.7% above |
| Pipeline | R1 COMPLETE, R2-R4 pending |
| 52-Week High/Low | $813.70 / $391.15 |

**KEY CONTEXT:** INTU has NO adversarial review (R2). FV $465 is likely inflated by ~15-20% based on our adversarial correction pattern (avg -19%). Post-DA FV likely ~$380-400.

## 2. WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW

### Q1 FY2026 (Nov 2025 report)
| Metric | Q1 FY26 | Q1 FY25 | Change |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| Revenue | $3.28B | $2.78B | +18% |
| EPS | $2.50 | $1.89 | +32% |
| QBO Online Rev | +25% | | Beat |
| QBO Ecosystem (excl Mail) | +25% | | Strong |
| TurboTax Live | +51% | | Exceptional |
| Credit Karma | +27% | | Accelerating |
| Mailchimp | ~flat/down | | Drag |

### FY2026 Full-Year Guidance (reaffirmed Q1)
| Metric | Low | High |
|--------|-----|------|
| Revenue | $18.16B | $18.35B |
| Revenue Growth | 12% | 13% |
| EPS | $20.07 | $20.32 |
| Operating Margin | 28%+ | |

### Consensus for Q2 FY2026
| Metric | Consensus | Whisper |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Revenue | ~$4.0-4.1B | Above Q1's +18% |
| EPS | ~$3.20-3.50 | Tax season starts late Q2 |

**Note:** Q2 is NOT the big quarter. Q3 (Jan-Apr tax season) drives ~40-45% of annual revenue. Q2 is about QuickBooks momentum and early TurboTax signals.

## 3. SCENARIOS

### BEAR (<20% probability)
**Triggers:** Q2 rev growth <10%, full-year guide cut, Mailchimp impairment, QBO churn spike
| Metric | Bear Case |
|--------|-----------|
| Revenue | <$3.9B (<10% growth) |
| EPS | <$3.00 |
| FY2026 guide | Cut to <12% revenue growth |
| Mailchimp | Revenue decline >5%, impairment risk |
| Insider selling | Accelerates post-earnings |
| Stock reaction | -15-20% to $330-340 range |

**MY ACTION IF BEAR:**
- Stock at $330-340 = WITHIN entry range ($350 target)
- BUT: if guide cut is structural (AI disruption confirmed), LOWER entry to $280-300
- If Mailchimp impairment: recalculate FV excluding Mailchimp goodwill
- DECISION: Wait 48-72h post-earnings, then evaluate with review-agent

### BASE (55% probability)
**Triggers:** Q2 in-line, guidance maintained, QBO steady, TurboTax Live growing
| Metric | Base Case |
|--------|-----------|
| Revenue | $4.0-4.2B (+12-15%) |
| EPS | $3.10-3.40 |
| FY2026 guide | Maintained or narrowed to high end |
| QBO | +20-25% (steady) |
| TurboTax Live | +40-50% (strong) |
| Credit Karma | +20-25% (moderating) |
| Stock reaction | +/-5% (no catalyst for entry) |

**MY ACTION IF BASE:**
- Stock stays $380-420 = ABOVE entry range
- CONTINUE MONITORING, no action
- Prioritize R2 (devil's advocate) to establish post-adversarial FV
- Entry remains $350 or below

### BULL (25% probability)
**Triggers:** Q2 beat, guide raise, Mailchimp recovery, AI monetization surprise
| Metric | Bull Case |
|--------|-----------|
| Revenue | >$4.3B (+15%+) |
| EPS | >$3.50 |
| FY2026 guide | Raised to 14-15% revenue growth |
| Mailchimp | First positive growth quarter |
| AI/GenOS | Quantified revenue attribution |
| Stock reaction | +10-15% to $430-460 |

**MY ACTION IF BULL:**
- Stock moves AWAY from entry = NO ACTION
- If stock rallies to $460+ = FV revision upward needed anyway
- CONTINUE R2 pipeline work

## 4. WHAT TO WATCH (Priority Order)

1. **QBO Online Accounting growth rate** — Most important metric. >20% = healthy. <15% = deceleration concern.
2. **FY2026 full-year guidance** — Maintained/raised = positive. Cut = bearish.
3. **Mailchimp revenue growth** — First positive quarter would remove drag narrative.
4. **TurboTax early indicators** — Any pre-season data (# returns filed, attach rates).
5. **Operating margin expansion** — >28% confirms operating leverage thesis.
6. **Insider transactions** — Any buying would be very positive. More selling = negative.
7. **AI/GenOS commentary** — Quantified revenue from AI features = catalyst.
8. **SBC % of FCF** — Was 39% in R1 thesis. If declining = quality improving.

## 5. DECISION FRAMEWORK

```
IF BEAR scenario:
  → IF price drops to $330-350:
    → FAST-TRACK R2 (devil's advocate)
    → If DA confirms FV > $380: entry candidate
    → If DA reduces FV to < $380: re-evaluate entry at $280-300
  → IF guide cut is STRUCTURAL (AI confirmed eating TurboTax):
    → KC#1: Remove from pipeline. AI disruption thesis invalidated.

IF BASE scenario:
  → NO ACTION on INTU
  → Continue R2 pipeline in normal priority

IF BULL scenario:
  → NO ACTION on INTU (moving away from entry)
  → Update FV estimates if guide raised materially
```

## 6. KILL CONDITIONS FOR PIPELINE

| KC# | Condition | Action |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| KC#1 | QBO growth <10% for 2 consecutive quarters | REMOVE from pipeline |
| KC#2 | TurboTax market share loss >3pp | REMOVE from pipeline |
| KC#3 | FY2026 guide cut >5% below original | LOWER entry by equivalent amount |
| KC#4 | Mailchimp impairment announced | Recalculate FV excluding Mailchimp goodwill |
| KC#5 | SBC rises above 45% of FCF | Downgrade QS by 5 points |
| KC#6 | AI competitor takes >5% DIY tax share | Reassess moat rating |
