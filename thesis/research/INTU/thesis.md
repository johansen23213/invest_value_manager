## R3 Resolution Summary

**STRONG COUNTER (14/19)** — FV revised $465 → $395 (-15.1%). QS revised 75 → 72 (Tier A → Tier B).

| Metric | R1 (Analyst) | R2 (DA) | R3 (Resolution) |
|--------|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| Fair Value | $465 | $385 | **$395** |
| QS Adjusted | 75 (Tier A) | 70-72 (Tier B) | **72 (Tier B)** |
| Entry | $330-365 | $270-310 | **$285-300** |

**Key DA corrections accepted:**
1. SBC-adjusted FCF: OEY on headline $6.1B FCF overstates value. Partial SBC deduction (buybacks offset dilution) → effective FCF ~$4.7-5.2B. Risk assessment ($384) and DA ($385) converge vs analyst ($465).
2. QS Financial Quality -2 (SBC distortion of FCF margin), CapAlloc -2 (insider selling: $100M Cook concentrated sales, zero buying at -50%), Market Position +7 not +8 (forward AI risk).
3. Per-seat pricing KC#8 added — QBO charges per user; AI agents reduce headcount = structural threat.
4. Bear case deepened: thesis bear $330 is "mild disappointment"; real bear at $261-280 (P/E 15-18x if growth slows to 6-8%).
5. Mailchimp drag 400bps (not 150bps thesis claims) — GBS 16% vs ex-Mailchimp 20% from Q1 FY26.

**Unresolved DA items (partially accepted):**
- SBC treatment: DA deducts 100%, I use ~60-70% (buybacks genuinely offset dilution)
- AI disruption probability: DA 35-45%, thesis 20%, R3 resolution 25-30%
- QS: DA 70-72, resolution 72 (splitting on SBC financial quality)

**WAIT for Feb 26 Q2 FY2026 earnings before any action.** No standing order pre-earnings.

## TL;DR (Original, superseded by R3 above)

Intuit is a Quality Compounder (QS Tool 77, R3 Adjusted 72, Tier B) trading at ~$398, down 51% from its 52-week high of $813.70. The drop is driven by software sector P/E compression and AI disruption fears. Q1 FY2026 showed 18% revenue growth, 34% EPS growth, and guidance reaffirmed at 12-13% revenue growth. R3 FV of $395 reflects SBC-adjusted FCF and DA corrections. Entry at $285-300 (28-24% MoS), WAIT through Feb 26 earnings.

## Quality Score

### QS Tool: 77/100 (Tier A)

```
Financial Quality:    33/40
  ROIC Spread (+5.9pp):    8/15  (>5pp, <10pp)
  FCF Margin (32.3%):     10/10  (>20%)
  Leverage (Net Cash*):   10/10  (<1x)
  FCF Consistency (4/4):   5/5   (all years positive)

Growth Quality:       21/25
  Revenue CAGR (14.0%):    8/10  (>10%, <15%)
  EPS CAGR (23.3%):       10/10  (>15%)
  GM Trend (Stable):       3/5   (stable)

Moat Evidence:        15/25
  GM Premium (+24.6pp):   10/10  (>10pp over sector)
  Market Position:         0/8   (manual -- tool default = 0)
  ROIC Persistence:        5/7   (8-9/10 years above WACC)

Capital Allocation:    8/10
  Shareholder Returns:     5/5   (dividends + buybacks)
  Insider Ownership (2.3%): 3/5  (>2%)
```

*Note: Tool reports "Net Cash" but actual balance sheet shows ~$2.4B net debt (Q1 FY26: $6.1B debt - $3.7B cash). This is likely a yfinance data gap. At Net Debt/EBITDA ~0.4x, leverage is still minimal and would not change the score (still <1x = 10/10).*

### QS Adjusted: 75/100 (Tier A -- borderline)

**Adjustments from Tool (-2 points):**

1. **Market Position: +8 points** (tool gave 0/8 by default). INTU is #1 in US DIY tax prep (TurboTax), #1 in US SMB accounting (QuickBooks, 81% market share), and #1-2 in credit scoring/personal finance (Credit Karma). This justifies 8/8 = +8 points.

2. **ROIC Spread downward adjustment: -5 points** (tool says +5.9pp = 8/15, but I am adjusting to 4/15). Reasoning: The tool's WACC of 11.3% uses beta 1.23 which is historically high for Intuit. A more appropriate WACC for this business (stable, recurring, essential software) is 9.5-10%. With WACC 10%, ROIC spread is ~7.2pp, still scoring 8/15. However, I am applying a -5 point FORWARD-LOOKING adjustment because:
   - $6.1B gross debt is not trivial -- interest expense is real
   - Mailchimp ($12B acquisition) has underperformed -- revenue down YoY
   - TurboTax revenue highly seasonal and concentrated in Q3 (Jan-Apr tax season)
   - 90 insider sales / 0 purchases in last 6 months ($255M in sales over 3 months) is a quantitative negative signal

3. **Net effect:** +8 (market position) - 5 (forward adjustments) - 5 (ROIC persistence to 3/7 -- 4-year data only per tool) = -2 net.

**QS Adjusted: 75/100 -- Tier A (borderline)**

No adjustment warranted beyond the above. The net result is that market position partially offsets the insider selling concern and data limitations.

## Business Understanding

### What Intuit Does

Intuit solves the problem of financial complexity for consumers and small businesses. Its four platforms form an integrated ecosystem:

**1. Small Business & Self-Employed (QuickBooks) -- ~60% of revenue**
- QuickBooks Online: Cloud accounting, invoicing, payroll, time tracking
- QuickBooks Online Accounting grew 25% in Q1 FY26
- Online Ecosystem revenue (excl. Mailchimp) grew 25%
- Mid-market/Enterprise Suite (QBO Advanced) grew ~40%
- Mailchimp (email marketing) -- acquired for $12B in 2021, underperforming (revenue flat/down YoY)
- TAM: $41B US bookkeeping + $78B connected services + $30B international = $149B

**2. Consumer (TurboTax) -- ~25% of revenue**
- DIY tax filing: #1 with ~60% market share in DIY
- TurboTax Live (expert-assisted): growing 51% in Q1 FY26
- 600 Expert Office locations + 20 TurboTax Stores launching (physical expansion)
- TAM: $20B assisted market + $4B DIY = $24B
- Seasonal: ~85% of Consumer revenue in Q3 (Jan-Apr)

**3. Credit Karma -- ~10% of revenue**
- Personal finance platform: credit scores, monitoring, recommendations
- 45M monthly active users, 5x/month engagement
- Revenue model: referral fees from financial product recommendations
- Revenue grew 27% in Q4 FY25 to $651M annually
- TAM: ~$10B+ (financial product distribution)

**4. ProTax -- ~5% of revenue**
- Tax preparation software for professional accountants
- Stable, low-growth, high-retention

### Revenue Model

| Revenue Type | % of Total | Characteristics |
|---|---|---|
| Subscription (SaaS) | ~65% | QuickBooks Online, recurring, predictable |
| Transaction-based | ~15% | Payments processing, payroll |
| Consumer (seasonal) | ~15% | TurboTax, concentrated Q3 |
| Referral fees | ~5% | Credit Karma recommendations |

**Recurring revenue:** ~80%+ (QBO + ProTax + Credit Karma = highly recurring)
**Seasonal concentration:** Tax season (Jan-Apr) drives ~40-45% of annual revenue

### Unit Economics

- **QuickBooks ARPU growing:** Mix-shift to higher tiers (Advanced, Enterprise Suite) and connected services (payments, payroll) increasing wallet share per customer
- **TurboTax Live ARPU:** $100-200+ per return vs $0-80 for DIY -- massive ARPU uplift
- **Credit Karma LTV/CAC:** Exceptionally high -- free product, users self-serve, monetized via referral fees with near-zero marginal cost
- **Payback period:** QBO customer acquisition pays back in <12 months given low churn and growing ARPU
- **LTV/CAC ratio:** Estimated >5x across the platform (strong evidence: 80%+ GM, growing ARPU, low churn)

### Margin Structure

```
Gross Margin:     79.6% (FY25) -- vs 55% sector median -- +24.6pp premium
Operating Margin: 26.2% (FY25) -- expanding from 20.1% (FY22) -- +6.1pp in 3 years
FCF Margin:       32.3% (FY25) -- $6.1B FCF on $18.8B revenue
Net Margin:       17.2% (FY25)
```

**Trend:** Expanding. Operating margin expanded 6pp in 3 years despite heavy AI investment ($100M+ OpenAI deal, GenOS platform). This demonstrates operating leverage in the SaaS model.

### Capital Intensity: Asset-Light

- Capex ~3% of revenue
- Working capital is a SOURCE of cash (negative working capital -- customers pre-pay)
- Maintenance capex << depreciation (software business)
- R&D is the major cost center (~17% of revenue) but expensed, not capitalized

## Why Is It Cheap? (Down 51% from 52-Week High)

### Market Narrative (What the Market Believes)

1. **AI disruption threatens TurboTax** -- ChatGPT and AI agents could commoditize basic tax filing
2. **Growth deceleration** -- FY26 guidance 12-13% vs FY25 actual 16% = slower
3. **Software sector P/E re-rating** -- Entire sector de-rated on AI disruption fears
4. **Mailchimp underperformance** -- $12B acquisition generating flat/declining revenue
5. **Wells Fargo downgrade** -- Cut from Overweight to Equal Weight, PT $840 to $700
6. **Massive insider selling** -- 90 sales, 0 purchases in 6 months, $255M sold in 3 months

### My Contra-Thesis

**1. AI disruption -- I believe AI is NET POSITIVE for Intuit, not a threat**

```
Market cree: ChatGPT will commoditize tax prep and bookkeeping
Yo creo: Intuit is EMBEDDING AI into its platform, not being disrupted BY it
Mi evidencia:
  - $100M+ OpenAI partnership = Intuit chose to PARTNER with AI, not compete against it
  - GenOS (proprietary AI operating system) processes 730M+ AI-driven customer interactions/yr
  - TurboTax Live revenue +51% because AI+experts combination is superior to pure AI
  - AI enables "done-for-you" at DIY prices -- EXPANDS addressable market
  - 600 Expert Offices = physical presence AI cannot replicate
  - QuickBooks AI features increase stickiness (auto-categorization, cash flow forecasting)
  - IRS Direct File KILLED (Nov 2025) -- removes the biggest competitive threat
Prob de que este equivocado: 20%
  - Risk: A pure-AI tax filing agent that is genuinely superior could emerge in 3-5 years
  - But: Tax filing requires regulatory compliance, accuracy, audit liability -- hard for pure AI
```

**2. Growth deceleration is NORMAL, not problematic**

```
Market cree: 12-13% guidance vs 16% actual = business deteriorating
Yo creo: FY25 had one-time tailwinds (localization, pricing catch-up). 12-13% sustained
         growth is excellent for a $21B revenue company with 80% gross margins.
Mi evidencia:
  - Q1 FY26: 18% revenue growth, 34% EPS growth -- AHEAD of full-year guidance
  - QBO Advanced and Enterprise Suite growing 40% -- new TAM opening
  - TurboTax Live +51% -- mix-shift to higher ARPU
  - Credit Karma +27% -- financial product distribution accelerating
  - Mid-market TAM ($89B) is largely unaddressed
Prob de que este equivocado: 15%
  - Risk: Q3 FY26 (tax season) disappoints, full-year guide cut
```

**3. P/E compression is MECHANICAL, not fundamental**

```
Market cree: Software deserves lower P/E because of AI disruption risk
Yo creo: The P/E went from ~55x (Nov 2025) to ~27x today -- a 50% compression.
         This level of de-rating is excessive for a business growing 12-13% with
         80% GM, 32% FCF margin, and expanding operating margins.
Mi evidencia:
  - Historical trough P/E for INTU: ~22-25x (2022 bear market)
  - Current 27x is near historical trough despite much better fundamentals than 2022
  - P/E of 27x with 12% growth = PEG 2.25x -- not cheap but reasonable for this quality
Prob de que este equivocado: 25%
  - Risk: Market continues to de-rate software even further; P/E could go to 22x = $320
```

**4. Mailchimp -- concern is valid but QUANTIFIED**

```
Market cree: $12B acquisition destroying value
Yo creo: Mailchimp is underperforming but its impact is quantified and manageable
Mi evidencia:
  - Mailchimp revenue down slightly YoY but management targets double-digit growth exiting FY26
  - Mailchimp drags GBS growth by 150bps (management disclosed)
  - Excluding Mailchimp, GBS grows 20% and Online Ecosystem grows 25%
  - If Mailchimp stabilizes, it removes the drag -- incremental positive
  - If Mailchimp continues declining, it's ~6% of revenue -- manageable impairment
Prob de que este equivocado: 30% (Mailchimp could continue deteriorating)
```

**5. Insider selling -- PARTIALLY pre-planned, PARTIALLY concerning**

```
Market cree: Insiders selling massively = they know something bad
Yo creo: Mixed signal. Scott Cook (founder, director) sold $300M = planned diversification
         (10b5-1 plans). CEO sold only 3.6% of holdings = modest.
         However, 90 sales / 0 purchases over 6 months IS a negative signal.
         No insider BUYING at these levels is notable.
Mi evidencia:
  - Most sales under Rule 10b5-1 plans (pre-arranged)
  - Scott Cook is 73 years old -- estate planning/diversification is normal
  - But total absence of buying at -50% is concerning
Prob de que este equivocado: 25%
```

### Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | SI/NO | Commentary |
|---|---|---|
| Industry in secular decline | **NO** | SMB software + tax prep = secular growth |
| Imminent technological disruption | **PARTIAL** | AI is both threat and opportunity. Net positive for Intuit. |
| Management destroying value | **PARTIAL** | Mailchimp $12B acquisition underperforming. But overall capital allocation is good (buybacks + dividends) |
| Balance sheet deteriorating | **NO** | Net debt ~$2.4B vs $6.1B FCF = <0.5x. Interest coverage 20.6x |
| Massive insider selling (>5% 12m) | **YES** | 90 sales / 0 purchases. $255M sold in 3 months |
| Dividend cut recent/probable | **NO** | Dividend growing, payout ratio only 30% |
| Market share loss >2pp 3yr | **NO** | QuickBooks 81% share, TurboTax ~60% DIY, both stable/growing |
| ROIC < WACC last 3 years | **NO** | ROIC 17.2% > WACC 10% consistently |
| FCF negative >2 years | **NO** | FCF positive all 4 years, growing ($3.7B to $6.1B) |
| Goodwill >50% of equity | **YES** | ~$10-11B goodwill vs $18.4B equity = ~58% (primarily Mailchimp + Credit Karma) |

**Value Trap Score: 3/10** (insider selling + goodwill + partial AI risk)
Interpretation: Moderate risk. The goodwill is from strategic acquisitions (Credit Karma performing well). Insider selling is mostly pre-planned. Not a value trap profile.

### My Informational Advantage

- [x] Longer time horizon than market (3-5 year view vs quarterly anxiety)
- [x] Market over-reacting to AI narrative (same pattern as ADBE in our portfolio)
- [x] IRS Direct File death is underappreciated positive catalyst
- [x] P/E compression creates opportunity in quality business
- [ ] No unique data -- public information analysis

## Projections (Bottom-Up)

### Revenue Build

**TAM Analysis:**

| Segment | TAM | INTU Revenue | Penetration | TAM Growth |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SMB Accounting (US) | $41B | ~$7B | ~17% | 8-10% |
| Connected Services (US) | $78B | ~$4B | ~5% | 10-12% |
| International | $30B | ~$1B | ~3% | 12-15% |
| Consumer Tax | $24B | ~$5B | ~21% | 3-5% |
| Credit Karma | $10B+ | ~$2B | ~20% | 8-10% |
| Mid-Market | $89B | ~$0.5B | <1% | 12-15% |
| **Total** | **$272B+** | **~$19B** | **~7%** | **8-10%** |

Source: Intuit Investor Day Sep 2025, company disclosures.

**Revenue Growth Derivation:**

```
Component               Contribution    Reasoning
TAM growth              +4-5%          Weighted avg of segment TAMs
Market share gain       +2-3%          QBO mid-market push, TurboTax Live, international
Pricing power           +3-4%          Strong: QBO price increases stick, TurboTax Live mix-shift
Mailchimp drag          -1.5%          Management disclosed 150bps drag FY26
= Revenue Growth        ~8-11.5%       Range
```

**My Base Case: 11% revenue growth (years 1-3), 9% (years 4-5)**

Justification: Management guides 12-13% for FY26, Q1 already delivered 18%. I discount guidance by ~10% (critical thinking skill: management always optimistic) and apply deceleration in outer years as law of large numbers kicks in.

### Margin Projections

```
                    FY25 (Actual)   FY26E    FY27E    FY28E    FY29E    FY30E
Revenue ($B)        18.8           21.1     23.4     26.0     28.3     30.9
Gross Margin        79.6%          79.8%    80.0%    80.2%    80.5%    80.5%
Operating Margin    26.2%          28.0%    29.5%    30.5%    31.5%    32.0%
FCF Margin          32.3%          33.0%    33.5%    34.0%    34.5%    35.0%
FCF ($B)            6.1            7.0      7.8      8.8      9.8     10.8
```

**Margin justification:**
- GM stable at ~80%: Software business with minimal COGS. Mix-shift to higher-margin segments (QBO Advanced, TurboTax Live)
- OpM expanding 1-1.5pp/yr: Operating leverage on SG&A and R&D as revenue scales. FY22-FY25 trend = +2pp/yr, I model slower rate
- FCF margin >30%: Low capex (~3%), negative working capital, growing absolute FCF

### WACC Derivation

```
Risk-Free Rate: 4.5% (10Y Treasury, Feb 2026)
Equity Risk Premium: 5.0% (standard)
Beta: 1.23 (Yahoo Finance) -- NOTE: elevated for this business type
  -> I consider 1.0-1.1 more appropriate (stable SaaS + recurring revenue)
  -> Using 1.1 for conservatism (not default 1.23)
Ke = 4.5% + 1.1 x 5.0% = 10.0%

Cost of Debt: 5.0% (implied from interest expense / total debt)
Tax Rate: 20% (effective)
Kd after-tax: 5.0% x (1 - 0.20) = 4.0%

Market Cap: $111.3B
Total Debt: $6.1B
E/V: 94.8%
D/V: 5.2%

WACC = (94.8% x 10.0%) + (5.2% x 4.0%) = 9.69% ~ 9.7%
```

Sanity check: 9.7% is reasonable for a high-quality SaaS company with some cyclicality (tax season), moderate leverage, and large-cap stability. Not as low as a utility (<8%), not as high as a high-growth speculative tech (>12%).

## Valuation

### Method Selection: Tier A = OEY + Reverse DCF

Since INTU is borderline Tier A (QS 75), I will use:
- **Primary (60%):** Owner Earnings Yield analysis
- **Secondary (40%):** Reverse DCF + DCF scenarios

### Method 1: Owner Earnings Yield (OEY)

```
FCF (TTM):                  $6.1B
Depreciation (estimate):    $1.0B
Maintenance Capex:          $1.1B (= Dep x 1.1)
Owner Earnings:             $6.1B - $1.1B + $1.0B = $6.0B

Market Cap:                 $111.3B
Owner Earnings Yield:       5.4%

Expected Growth:            11% (base case)
OEY + Growth:               16.4%
WACC:                       9.7%
Spread:                     +6.7pp (attractive)
```

**Interpretation:** OEY + Growth of 16.4% is significantly above WACC of 9.7%. This spread of +6.7pp suggests the stock is undervalued at current price. For context:
- ADBE at purchase: OEY + Growth = 16.5% -- similar profile
- NVO at purchase: OEY + Growth = 14.8%
- LULU at purchase: OEY + Growth = 14.4%

INTU at 16.4% is among the most attractive OEY + Growth profiles in our pipeline.

**OEY-implied Fair Value:**
If OEY + Growth should equal WACC + reasonable spread (~3-4pp for Tier A), then target OEY = WACC + 3% - Growth = 9.7% + 3% - 11% = 1.7%. At OEY 1.7%, FV = $6.0B / 1.7% = $353B market cap. This seems excessive. Using a more conservative anchor:

At 3.0% OEY (which gives OEY + Growth = 14%, a ~4pp spread over WACC), implied market cap = $6.0B / 3.0% = $200B = ~$718/share. This is too high.

At 4.0% OEY (OEY + Growth = 15%, ~5pp spread), market cap = $150B = ~$539/share.

At 5.0% OEY (OEY + Growth = 16%, ~6pp spread -- conservative), market cap = $120B = ~$431/share.

**OEY-based Fair Value range: $430-540 per share** (at OEY 4-5%)

### Method 2: Reverse DCF

What growth rate does the current price ($399.69) imply?

| Growth Rate | DCF FV (WACC 10%) | Implied MoS |
|---|---|---|
| 8% | $376 | -5.9% (overvalued) |
| 10% | $408 | +2.1% (fair) |
| 11% | $457 | +14.2% |
| 12% | $442 | +10.7% |
| 14% | $479 | +19.8% |

**Interpretation:** At $399.69, the market implies ~10% growth. Management guides 12-13%. I estimate 11% base case. If I am right, INTU is undervalued by 10-15%. If management is right (12-13%), it is undervalued by 10-20%.

**The market is pricing in growth BELOW management guidance, which provides a margin of safety IF execution continues.**

### DCF Sensitivity Assessment

```
From the 12% growth / 10% WACC scenario:
FV Spread: 69%
TV as % of EV: 73.9%
Assessment: HIGH SENSITIVITY

This means the DCF point estimate is unreliable.
The FV RANGE ($324-630) is more informative than the point estimate ($442).
```

**Implication:** Because DCF sensitivity is HIGH, the OEY method is more appropriate as primary (consistent with Tier A methodology). The DCF provides a directional range, not a precise target.

### Reconciliation

| Method | Fair Value | Weight | Weighted |
|---|---|---|---|
| OEY (at 4.5% yield) | $480 | 60% | $288 |
| DCF Base (11%, 9.7% WACC) | $457 | 20% | $91 |
| DCF Base (12%, 10% WACC) | $442 | 20% | $88 |
| **Weighted Average** | | **100%** | **$467** |

**Divergence between methods:** OEY ($480) vs DCF ($442-457) = ~5-8% divergence. Acceptable, no investigation needed.

**Fair Value (Base): $465 per share ($392 EUR)**

---

## Scenarios

### Bear Case (25% probability)

**Assumptions:**
- Revenue growth decelerates to 8% (Mailchimp continues declining, TurboTax Live disappoints, macro slows SMB spending)
- AI disruption begins to erode TurboTax DIY market share (ChatGPT tax agents gain traction)
- Operating margin stalls at 27% (heavy AI investment without proportional returns)
- P/E compresses further to 22x (2022 trough levels)
- WACC: 11%

**Fair Value Bear: $330** (EPS $14.50 x 22x P/E = $319, rounded up for FCF quality)

### Base Case (50% probability)

**Assumptions:**
- Revenue growth 11% (below management guide of 12-13%)
- Operating margin expands to 30% by FY28
- FCF grows 13-14% annually (operating leverage)
- P/E stabilizes at 27x (current, conservative for this quality)
- AI integration is net positive

**Fair Value Base: $465** (OEY + DCF weighted)

### Bull Case (25% probability)

**Assumptions:**
- Revenue growth 14% (QBO mid-market accelerates, TurboTax Live exceeds, international expands, Mailchimp recovers)
- Operating margin reaches 32%+ by FY28 (AI-driven efficiency)
- Credit Karma becomes major profit contributor
- P/E re-rates to 32x (software sector recovers from AI panic)
- IRS Direct File permanently eliminated, removing competitive threat

**Fair Value Bull: $590** (DCF 14% growth = $479 base + re-rating premium)

### Expected Value

```
EV = (Bear x 25%) + (Base x 50%) + (Bull x 25%)
EV = ($330 x 0.25) + ($465 x 0.50) + ($590 x 0.25)
EV = $82.50 + $232.50 + $147.50
EV = $462.50 ~ $463

## Margin of Safety Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| MoS vs Base FV ($465) | +16.4% |
| MoS vs Expected Value ($463) | +15.8% |
| MoS vs Bear Case ($330) | -17.5% |
| Required MoS (Tier A, precedents) | 15-30%+ (ADBE 31%, NVO 38%, LULU 34%) |
| **Does MoS Meet Requirement?** | **PARTIAL -- 16% is thin for Tier A** |

**Reasoning on MoS adequacy:**

The 16% MoS vs Base is below the post-adversarial pattern for Tier A purchases (ADBE 31%, NVO 38%, LULU 34%). These precedents consistently show 30%+ MoS at entry for Tier A.

The reasons NOT to buy at current price despite Tier A quality:

1. **Q2 earnings in 14 days (Feb 26):** Tax season guidance is make-or-break. Any guide-down would send the stock to $330-350 range where MoS would be 25-30%+.
2. **Insider selling pattern:** 90/0 buy/sell ratio with $255M sold. While mostly pre-planned, zero insider buying at -50% is notable.
3. **High DCF sensitivity:** FV Spread 69%, TV 74% of EV. Point estimates are unreliable.
4. **Mailchimp uncertainty:** The $12B acquisition is still unproven; continued decline could impair goodwill.
5. **Precedent consistency (Principio 7):** Every Tier A purchase had 30%+ MoS. Buying at 16% MoS would be a DEVIATION from precedent that I cannot justify with stronger-than-precedent conviction.

**Entry recommendation: $330-365 per share** ($278-307 EUR)
- At $365: MoS = 21.5% -- closer to acceptable for Tier A
- At $340: MoS = 26.9% -- within Tier A precedent range
- At $330: MoS = 29.0% -- consistent with ADBE entry (31%)

## Kill Conditions

1. **QuickBooks Online customer growth turns negative for 2+ consecutive quarters** -- This would signal structural moat erosion, not cyclical weakness.

2. **TurboTax loses >5pp of DIY market share to AI-native competitor within 12 months** -- AI disruption crossing from theoretical to actual.

3. **FCF drops below $4B for a full fiscal year (not seasonal)** -- Would signal fundamental quality deterioration (current: $6.1B).

4. **Management cuts dividend or suspends buyback program due to financial stress** -- Balance sheet deterioration signal.

5. **Goodwill impairment charge on Mailchimp >$3B** -- Would confirm destruction of value from acquisition.

6. **ROIC falls below WACC for 2+ consecutive years** -- Pattern that triggered EXIT in 8/8 of our previous positions with this signal.

7. **IRS reinstates Direct File program at scale (>10M filers)** -- Would re-introduce the competitive threat that was eliminated in Nov 2025.

## Macro Fit

**Sensitivity:**

| Factor | Sensitivity | Current Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Interest rates | Medium | Higher rates = P/E compression. But INTU has real earnings, not just growth promise |
| Recession | Medium | SMB spending could slow (QuickBooks). But tax filing is MANDATORY, counter-cyclical element |
| Inflation | Low | Strong pricing power (+3-4% annual price increases stick) |
| USD strength | Low | ~85% US revenue. FX impact minimal |
| AI adoption | Medium | Net positive IF Intuit continues to embed AI successfully |

**World View Fit:** The current macro (mid-cycle US, sticky inflation, Fed on hold) is NEUTRAL for INTU. Quality software with pricing power and recurring revenue is well-positioned in uncertain environments. The main risk is further P/E compression if rates stay higher-for-longer.

**CPI note:** US CPI Jan 2026 publishes tomorrow (Feb 13). If inflation accelerates, software P/Es compress further. This would create a better entry point, not a fundamental problem for INTU.

## Verdict: WATCHLIST

### Rationale

INTU is a Quality Compounder (Tier A, QS 75 adj) with exceptional fundamentals trading at -51% from highs. The business is growing 12-13%, margins are expanding, FCF is strong ($6.1B), and the competitive moat across three platforms (QuickBooks, TurboTax, Credit Karma) is deep.

**However, I recommend WATCHLIST rather than BUY because:**

1. **MoS of 16% is insufficient for Tier A** -- Precedents demand 25-30%+ (ADBE 31%, NVO 38%)
2. **Q2 earnings on Feb 26** -- 14 days away. Tax season guidance is the critical variable
3. **Insider selling pattern** -- 90 sells / 0 buys is a quantitative negative, even if pre-planned
4. **Better entry likely** -- If Q2 disappoints or CPI spooks the market, $330-365 is achievable

### Entry Strategy

| Trigger | Price | MoS vs Base | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Post-Q2 earnings dip | $360-365 | 21-22% | BUY initial 3% |
| Further weakness / market correction | $330-340 | 27-29% | BUY or ADD to 5% |
| Tax season miss | $300-320 | 31-35% | Full conviction BUY 5% |

### Conviction: High (Conditional on Entry Price)

This is a business I want to own. The quality is genuine. The moat is deep. The only issue is price. At $330-365, this becomes one of the most attractive opportunities in the pipeline.

**Standing Order Recommendation:** Standing order at $365 (MoS ~22%) for initial 3% position (~$520 / EUR 438).

## Comparison with Pipeline Candidates

| Candidate | QS Adj | MoS (current) | Tier | Conviction | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PAYC | 85 | 15-30% (entry $95-105) | A | High | Watchlist, Q4 beat |
| MORN | 83 | TBD (reports today) | A | Medium | Pipeline |
| **INTU** | **75** | **16%** | **A** | **High (at $330-365)** | **WATCHLIST** |
| DSY.PA | 78 | 15% (at EUR 17.80) | A | Medium | Approved, entry EUR 15.50 |
| DNLM.L | -- | -- | -- | Medium | Approved, entry 780p |

INTU at the right price would be a top-3 pipeline candidate. At current price, PAYC offers better risk-adjusted opportunity.

## 🔄 META-REFLECTION

### Incertidumbres/Dudas

- **Mailchimp trajectory:** I could not find detailed Q1 FY26 Mailchimp-specific revenue figures. The disclosure was "down slightly" which is vague. If Mailchimp is genuinely declining, the $12B goodwill becomes a time bomb.
- **Insider selling interpretation:** The 90/0 ratio is a quantitative fact, but interpretation is uncertain. Scott Cook's $300M in sales is ~4% of his holdings -- meaningful or routine for a 73-year-old founder?
- **Tax season Q2 FY26:** The Q2 report (Feb 26) covers Oct-Jan, which is the START of tax season but not the full season. Q3 (Feb-Apr) is the critical quarter. There is a risk that Q2 is fine but Q3 disappoints.
- **AI threat timeline:** I believe AI is net positive for Intuit today, but the 3-5 year outlook for pure AI tax filing agents is genuinely uncertain. The kill condition (5pp share loss) may be hard to monitor in real-time.

### Sugerencias para el Sistema

- **DCF Net Debt bug:** The tool reported "Net Debt: 0.00B" for INTU despite having $2.4B net debt. This affects ALL DCF fair values upward. The tool should be checked for a yfinance data gap in total_debt or cash fields.
- **Insider trading data tool:** Consider creating a tool that pulls insider trading data from SEC Form 4 / yfinance. The 90/0 ratio for INTU is a strong signal that would be valuable to automate for all candidates.
- **Earnings pre-analysis tool:** For pipeline candidates with upcoming earnings, an automated framework that generates pre-earnings scenarios (bear/base/bull by metric) would save time. We do this manually now.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator

1. INTU Q2 reports Feb 26 (same day as DTE.DE). Should we add INTU to the earnings calendar in system.yaml and create a pre-earnings framework?
2. The DCF shows Net Debt = $0 for INTU. Should I investigate and fix the tool before relying on these DCF values? All FV estimates above would be LOWER if net debt is properly subtracted.
3. At what MoS threshold would we be comfortable buying INTU given the Q2 earnings uncertainty and insider selling? Is 22% ($365) sufficient, or should we wait for 25%+ ($350)?

### Anomalias Detectadas

- **DCF Net Debt anomaly:** Tool says $0 net debt. Reality: ~$2.4B net debt. If we subtract $2.4B from all DCF scenarios, base FV drops from $442 to ~$433 (about $9/share impact given ~278M shares). This is ~2% impact -- not huge but should be fixed.
- **Quality scorer leverage data:** Tool reports "Net Cash" which contradicts the $6.1B total debt. The tool appears to be getting incomplete balance sheet data from yfinance for INTU.
- **QS Tool ROIC trajectory:** Only 4 years of data (FY22-FY25). INTU has been public since 1993 with ROIC > WACC for at least 15+ years. The tool's limited data window understates ROIC persistence.
