# Investment Committee Decision: DSY.PA (Dassault Systemes SE)

**Date:** 2026-02-11
**Committee Version:** v4.0 (10 Gates)
**Current Price:** EUR 17.77
**User Entry Target:** EUR 15.50 (overrides thesis EUR 16.50-17.00)
**User QS Classification:** Tier B (QS 70), NOT Tier A adjusted 78
**User Directive:** Wait for Q1 2026 results (April-May) before buying -- standing order only

---

## PASO 0.5: PRECEDENTES CONSULTADOS

### Most Similar Precedents

1. **ADBE:** Tier A (QS 76), MoS 31%, sizing 4.8%, HOLD. Relevance: Same sector (technology/software), same "quality compounder castigated by market" thesis. Adobe was at 52-week low when purchased. KEY DIFFERENCE: ADBE had 12%+ revenue growth; DSY has 3.2%.

2. **BYIT.L:** Tier A (QS 81, later revised to 68-72 Tier B via adversarial), MoS 35%, sizing 3.5%, HOLD ON PROBATION. Relevance: QS inflation pattern (81 -> 68-72 is a 9-13 point drop). Similar story of "fallen angel tech company." KEY LESSON: Adversarial review downgraded BYIT.L from Tier A to Tier B after purchase. The QS adjustment pattern for DSY (70 -> 78) matches this inflation pattern.

3. **HRB:** Tier B (QS 70), MoS 42%, sizing 5.7% post-ADD, SOLD at -13.25%. Relevance: Identical QS tool score (70). HRB was purchased with high MoS but adversarial review found moat breach (Intuit). KEY LESSON: QS 70 is Tier B, not Tier A. The ADD standing order at $35 amplified losses when the thesis was invalidated. Standing orders for non-Tier-A require extra caution.

### Deviation from Precedents

**I am accepting the user's directive to treat DSY.PA as Tier B (QS 70), which is CONSISTENT with:**
- BYIT.L adversarial experience (QS inflated from 81 to real 68-72)
- HRB experience (QS 70 = Tier B, requires higher MoS)
- Error #43 pattern (12/13 theses had inflated QS)
- Devil's advocate recommendation (QS 70-75 = Tier B)

**For a Tier B company, precedent MoS acceptance ranges from 20-42%:**
- HRB at QS 70 was accepted at MoS 42% (then failed for other reasons)
- Tier B pattern in decisions_log: 20-25% minimum typical
- At EUR 15.50, MoS vs valuation-specialist FV EUR 20.00 = 22.5% -- within Tier B range

## GATE 0: SECTOR VIEW EXISTS -- PASS

```
[X] Sector identified: Technology / Software
[X] Sector view found: world/sectors/technology.md
[X] Last updated: 2026-02-11 (TODAY -- already includes DSY.PA analysis)
[X] DSY.PA listed in sector view as watchlist candidate with entry EUR 16.50-17.00
Verdict: PASS. Sector view exists, is current, and includes DSY.PA.
```

---

## GATE 1: QUALITY SCORE -- PASS (Tier B)

```
[X] QS Tool: 70/100 (Tier B)
[X] QS Thesis Adjusted: 78/100 (Tier A borderline)
[X] User Directive: Treat as Tier B (QS 70)
[X] Devil's Advocate: Recommends QS 70-75 (Tier B)
[X] Tier D check: NO (QS 70 >> 35 threshold)
```

**Committee Assessment:**

The thesis adjusts QS from 70 to 78 (+8 points for market position 0/8 -> 8/8). The adjustment is factually defensible -- DSY IS #1 globally in PLM. However:

1. The adversarial program (Sessions 48-52) found that 12/13 positions had inflated QS. The BYIT.L precedent (QS 81 -> 68-72) shows the pattern: adjustments at tier boundaries that change the investment framework.

2. The devil's advocate correctly identifies that the +8 adjustment moves DSY from Tier B to Tier A, changing MoS requirements. A more conservative +5 (giving QS 75, absolute floor of Tier A) would be defensible, but the user explicitly directs Tier B treatment.

3. The growth quality sub-score of 10/25 is the weakest category. Revenue CAGR 3.2% with flat EPS guidance for FY2026 is NOT compounder-grade growth. The moat is wide, but compounders need BOTH moat AND growth.

**Verdict: PASS as Tier B (QS 70). This is the honest classification.**

---

## GATE 2: BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING -- PASS

```
[X] Business Analysis Framework completed (in thesis)
[X] Can explain in 2 minutes: YES
[X] Know WHY it is cheap + counter-thesis: YES
[X] Value trap checklist: 0.5/10 (very low risk)
[X] Informational advantage identified: YES (longer time horizon, cloud transition understanding)
```

**Can I explain in 2 minutes?**

Dassault Systemes is the global #1 in PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) software. Their products -- CATIA, SOLIDWORKS, 3DEXPERIENCE -- are used to design 90% of aircraft and 80% of automobiles worldwide. The business has extreme switching costs (certification lock-in, decades of design data, millions of trained engineers), 83.7% gross margins, EUR 1.5B annual FCF, net cash EUR 1.3-1.5B, and 48.8% family ownership.

The stock crashed -21% today (and -56% from 52-week high) because: (a) Q4 revenue growth was only +1%, worst in recent memory, (b) FY2026 guidance of 3-5% growth disappointed consensus of 5.8%, (c) flat EPS guidance, (d) Medidata/Life Sciences declining, (e) AI disruption fears. The counter-thesis is that the moat is intact (customers are NOT leaving), the weakness is cyclical (EU auto + cloud transition cannibalization), and the market is pricing in 1-2% perpetual growth -- too pessimistic for a wide-moat business with 82% recurring revenue.

**Why it is cheap:** Market is punishing 4 years of revenue deceleration (7% -> 5% -> 4% -> 3-5% guided), compounded by a -21% crash today on Q4 miss. AI disruption narrative creating sector-wide de-rating of European software.

**Counter-thesis risks (from devil's advocate):**
- The Adobe parallel is materially flawed (Adobe transitioned in 3 years, DSY has been at it 14 years)
- Revenue deceleration is a 4-year structural TREND, not cyclical
- Medidata losing to Veeva, Siemens Dotmatics entering life sciences
- 3DEXPERIENCE platform was DOWN 3% in Q4 (growth engine shrinking)
- ARR growth of 6% is underwhelming for a "cloud transition" company

**Verdict: PASS. Business is well-understood, counter-thesis is documented and taken seriously.**

---

## GATE 3: PROJECTION FUNDAMENTALS -- PASS (with concerns)

```
[X] Revenue growth derived: TAM +6%, market share stable, pricing +2%, cloud drag -2% = 4% base
[X] WACC calculated: Ke 6.65% (adjusted beta 0.70), WACC 6.5% calculated, 8.0-8.5% with risk premium
[X] Terminal growth justified: 2.0% (at or below EUR-area inflation)
[X] Bear/Base/Bull documented:
    Bear (30%): EUR 16.00 (growth stalls at 2-3%, 12-13x EV/EBIT)
    Base (45%): EUR 20.00 (growth 4%, 13x EV/EBIT)
    Bull (25%): EUR 27.00 (growth 6-7%, 17-20x EV/EBIT)
```

**Concerns:**
- Revenue CAGR of 3.2% over last 4 years BELOW the 4% base case assumption. Recent momentum (Q4 +1%) is WORSE than base case.
- FY2026 EPS guided flat (EUR 1.30-1.34 vs EUR 1.31). This is zero growth for the next 12 months.
- DCF sensitivity is 73-78% with terminal value 74% of EV -- highly model-dependent.
- The valuation-specialist correctly anchored to conservative end (EUR 19.50 DCF) rather than optimistic (EUR 22.25).

**Verdict: PASS. Projections are documented and derived from business logic, not defaults. Concerns are valid but do not block -- they inform the MoS requirement.**

---

## GATE 4: MULTI-METHOD VALUATION -- PASS

```
[X] Method appropriate for Tier B: DCF + EV/EBIT (correct per framework)
[X] Method 1 (DCF, 40% weight): FV EUR 19.50
[X] Method 2 (EV/EBIT 13x, 30% weight): FV EUR 20.75
[X] Method 3 (OEY + Growth, 15% weight): 11.3% (supports EUR 19-21 range)
[X] Method 4 (Reverse DCF, 15% weight): Market implies 1-2% growth (floor EUR 17-18)
[X] Weighted FV: EUR 20.00
[X] Divergence: 6.4% (DCF vs EV/EBIT) -- well within 30% threshold
```

**Key validation points:**
- FV EUR 20.00 implies IFRS P/E of 22x -- the valuation-specialist flags this as generous for a company guiding flat EPS. This is an honest concern.
- Non-IFRS P/E of 15.3x at FV is at the low end of sector ranges, reflecting growth discount. Appropriate.
- Methods converge well (6.4% spread). The DCF, multiples, and OEY all support EUR 19-21 range.
- Morningstar FV EUR 32.50 is 55% above our estimate. The gap is almost entirely growth assumptions. We are deliberately conservative post-adversarial.

**Using valuation-specialist's FV EUR 20.00 (not thesis's EUR 21.00) as the reference point.**

**Verdict: PASS. Two methods, appropriate for Tier B, convergent results.**

---

## GATE 5: MARGIN OF SAFETY -- PASS (at EUR 15.50)

```
[X] Tier: B (QS 70, per user directive)
[X] MoS at EUR 15.50 vs Base FV EUR 20.00: +22.5%
[X] MoS at EUR 15.50 vs Bear FV EUR 16.00: -3.1% (very tight)
[X] MoS at EUR 15.50 vs Expected Value EUR 20.55: +24.6%
```

**Razonamiento:**

For Tier B, precedent MoS acceptance is 20-25% minimum. At EUR 15.50:
- 22.5% MoS vs base = WITHIN Tier B range
- 24.6% MoS vs EV = WITHIN Tier B range
- -3.1% vs Bear = TIGHT but acceptable given bear case is a genuine worst case (2-3% growth permanently + multiple compression)

**The bear case proximity is the key tension.** At EUR 15.50, we are only EUR 0.50 above the bear case. If the bear materializes, we lose ~3%. If the base materializes, we gain ~29%. The asymmetry is acceptable but not exceptional for Tier B.

**Comparison with precedents:**
- HRB at QS 70: accepted at MoS 42% (much higher, but thesis later failed)
- Tier B pattern: 20-25% minimum
- DSY at 22.5% MoS is at the LOW end of Tier B acceptance range

**Why I accept 22.5% rather than demanding 25%+:**
1. Wide moat (22/25) -- the strongest moat in our portfolio. CATIA's aerospace lock-in is near-permanent.
2. Net cash EUR 1.3-1.5B protects against permanent capital loss
3. 83.7% gross margin provides enormous cushion against operational deterioration
4. 48.8% family ownership aligns management with long-term shareholders
5. The bear case (EUR 16.00) assumes growth permanently stalls at 2-3% AND multiple compresses -- this is a pessimistic confluence

**But I would NOT accept less than 20% MoS for this company at QS 70 with 7 HIGH/CRITICAL risks.**

**Verdict: PASS at EUR 15.50 entry. MoS of 22.5% is acceptable for Tier B given the quality of the moat and balance sheet. Would NOT pass at EUR 17.77 (MoS 12.6% -- insufficient for Tier B).**

---

## GATE 6: MACRO CONTEXT -- PASS

```
[X] World view reviewed: 2026-02-05 (6 days old, acceptable)
[X] Cycle: Late cycle, flight to quality
[X] Fit with cycle: NEUTRAL-POSITIVE
[X] Megatrends: AI [POSITIVE for PLM], Demographics [NEUTRAL], Europe fiscal [POSITIVE]
```

**Assessment:**
- Late cycle environment favors quality businesses with recurring revenue and pricing power. DSY fits.
- ECB holding at 2.0% -- stable rates environment is neutral for software multiples.
- European manufacturing weakness (Germany +1.0-1.4% projected) is a HEADWIND for DSY's auto customers.
- AI is net POSITIVE for PLM/simulation software per sector view. NVIDIA partnership validates.
- EUR 500B German infrastructure stimulus could eventually benefit Dassault's industrial customers.
- Trade war escalation is a risk but DSY has minimal direct tariff exposure (software, not goods).

**Key concern:** No near-term catalyst for re-rating. The macro is neutral, not catalytic. The user's directive to wait for Q1 2026 results addresses this.

**Verdict: PASS. Macro context is neutral, not adverse. No blocking macro concern.**

---

## GATE 7: PORTFOLIO FIT -- PASS

```
[X] Price verified: EUR 17.77 (2026-02-11, pre-market close)
[X] Sizing proposed: ~3% (~EUR 330, ~21 shares at EUR 15.50)
```

**constraint_checker.py output (CHECK DSY.PA 330):**
- Position post-purchase: 3.3% -- coherent with Tier B sizing precedents (3-5%)
- Technology sector post-purchase: 11.4% (from 8.0% with ADBE + BYIT.L) -- reasonable, three different sub-sectors (creative, IT services, PLM) with low correlation
- EU geographic exposure post-purchase: 16.8% -- modest increase, DSY is French-listed but 60%+ revenue is global
- Cash post-purchase: 45.2% (EUR 4,514) -- still ample for opportunities
- Correlation with existentes: LOW -- PLM software has minimal correlation with Creative (ADBE) or IT services (BYIT.L)

**Reasoning by principle:**

- **Principio 1 (Sizing by Conviction):** 3.3% for a Tier B company with medium conviction is appropriate. If it falls 50%, I lose 1.7% -- acceptable for this conviction level. Precedent: HRB at QS 70 was sized at 3.8% initial (before ADD). DSY at 3.3% is slightly smaller, reflecting more caution.

- **Principio 3 (Sector Diversification):** Technology at 11.4% is reasonable. ADBE (Creative), BYIT.L (IT services), DSY.PA (PLM) represent three distinct sub-sectors. A sector-wide AI fear event would hit all three, but their fundamental businesses have low correlation.

- **Principio 4 (Cash as Active Position):** Cash at 45.2% post-purchase remains very high. With 44% cash currently and the adversarial review lesson ("44% cash post-adversarial is capital preservation, not cash drag"), deploying EUR 330 still leaves ample dry powder. This is not cash pressure -- it is selective deployment.

**Precedent sizing for Tier B:**
- HRB: 3.8% initial, 5.7% post-ADD (same QS 70)
- DSY.PA at 3.3% is slightly smaller, consistent with caution for a company in falling-knife territory

**Verdict: PASS. Sizing is coherent with Tier B precedents and conviction level.**

---

## GATE 8: SECTOR UNDERSTANDING -- PASS

```
[X] Sector view exists: world/sectors/technology.md
[X] Sector view reviewed: 2026-02-11 (updated TODAY with DSY.PA analysis)
[X] TAM and trends understood: PLM market $46-75B, growing 5.9-8.8% CAGR
[X] Disruption risks known:
    - Siemens Altair ($10.6B acquisition) strengthening simulation
    - Siemens Dotmatics ($5.1B) targeting life sciences
    - AI-native design tools (long-term, 7-15 years)
    - Autodesk Fusion 360 pressuring SOLIDWORKS from below
[X] Sector position: NEUTRAL (selective in quality compounders)
```

**Key sector insights that inform DSY.PA evaluation:**
- PLM is a natural oligopoly (4-firm concentration, same players for 40 years)
- AI is net POSITIVE for PLM per sector view (validated by NVIDIA partnership)
- Siemens is the most credible competitive threat but operates in parallel, not displacement
- European software is "ODIADO" per sentiment analysis -- contra-tesis opportunity exists

**Verdict: PASS. Deep sector understanding exists and informs the thesis.**

---

## GATE 9: SELF-CRITICISM / KILL CONDITIONS -- PASS

```
[X] Unvalidated assumptions listed:
    1. Revenue growth recovers to 4%+ (currently 3.2% and decelerating)
    2. Cloud transition eventually accelerates subscription growth
    3. Medidata stabilizes or is contained at 15% of revenue
    4. NVIDIA partnership generates revenue by 2027-28
    5. European auto sector recovers, benefiting CATIA/SOLIDWORKS demand

[X] Biases recognized:
    [X] Popularity bias: DSY is well-known -- but discovered via screening/sector view, not implicit knowledge
    [X] Confirmation bias: Wide moat is compelling, risk of underweighting growth concerns
    [X] Recency bias: -21% today creates urgency. User directive to wait for Q1 addresses this.
    [X] Anchoring bias: Morningstar EUR 32.50 and consensus EUR 31.10 are far above our FV. Risk of feeling "cheap" relative to consensus when our own FV is EUR 20.

[X] Kill conditions defined:
    1. ROIC falls below WACC for 2 consecutive years (currently +9.2pp -- far from trigger)
    2. Recurring revenue growth turns negative (currently +6%)
    3. CATIA loses major aerospace program to Siemens NX
    4. FCF declines >20% in a single year without acquisition explanation
    5. FY2026 actual revenue growth <3% (below bottom of guidance) -- confirms structural impairment
    6. Two consecutive quarters of negative revenue growth (actual contraction)
    7. Medidata goodwill impairment charge (confirms acquisition was value-destroying)
    8. AI competitor demonstrates viable PLM/CAD product at 50%+ lower cost

[X] What would make me change my mind:
    - Q1 2026 showing <3% growth → thesis weakens materially
    - Medidata impairment → reassess entire valuation
    - Data breach (0APT, Feb 3) escalates to defense customer loss → reassess
    - Siemens wins a Top 5 automotive customer from Dassault → moat erosion signal
```

**Verdict: PASS. Assumptions and biases documented. Kill conditions are specific and actionable.**

---

## GATE 10: COUNTER-ANALYSIS & INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENTS -- CONDITIONAL PASS

```
[X] counter_analysis.md exists: YES
[X] moat_assessment.md exists: YES
[X] risk_assessment.md exists: YES
[X] valuation_report.md exists: YES
```

### Counter-Analysis Assessment

**Verdict:** MODERATE-STRONG COUNTER (4 STRONG, 4 HIGH, 12 MODERATE, 2 LOW out of 22 total)

**For each HIGH/CRITICAL challenge:**

| # | Challenge | Thesis Addresses? | Resolution |
|---|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| 1 | Adobe parallel materially flawed | PARTIALLY -- thesis acknowledges 15% prob of being wrong on cloud | ACCEPTED. Committee strips Adobe parallel from emotional weight. DSY evaluated on own merits as a wide-moat mature software company, not "the next Adobe." |
| 2 | Revenue deceleration is 4-year structural trend | YES -- thesis notes 3.2% CAGR | ACCEPTED. This is WHY we classify as Tier B not Tier A, and WHY we demand 22.5% MoS not 15%. |
| 3 | Medidata is value-destroying acquisition | PARTIALLY -- thesis rates 35% prob of structural | PARTIALLY RESOLVED. Medidata at 15% of revenue is concerning but not fatal to thesis. If Medidata stays flat/declining, the rest of the business (85% of revenue) still generates EUR 1.3B+ FCF with wide moat. Kill condition added: Medidata impairment charge. |
| 4 | 3DEXPERIENCE platform DOWN 3% in Q4 | NOT ADDRESSED in thesis | DOCUMENTED AS RISK. The growth engine shrinking is a yellow flag. If Q1 2026 also shows 3DEXPERIENCE decline, the "cloud transition working" narrative is seriously weakened. Added to monitoring. |
| 5 | Siemens EUR 15B acquisitions (Altair + Dotmatics) | PARTIALLY -- thesis mentions Siemens but underweights | ACCEPTED AS RISK. Siemens is executing a deliberate two-front assault (simulation + life sciences). However, this is market share nibbling in new accounts, not displacement from installed base (switching costs prevent that). |
| 6 | No near-term catalyst | YES -- thesis concludes WATCHLIST precisely for this reason | RESOLVED. User directive to wait for Q1 2026 results addresses timing risk. Standing order set below current price. |
| 7 | Falling knife (-21% today) | YES -- thesis recommends not buying today | RESOLVED. User directive for EUR 15.50 entry (vs EUR 17.77 today) provides additional 12.8% cushion from today's price. |
| 8 | Dead money 12-24 months | NOT FULLY ADDRESSED | ACCEPTED AS RISK. With flat EPS guidance, no catalyst, and damaged management credibility, 12-24 months of dead money is probable. At 3.3% position size with standing order, the opportunity cost is limited. Cash remains 45% for better opportunities. |

**Unresolved conflicts:**
1. 3DEXPERIENCE decline (-3% Q4) contradicts "cloud transition working" narrative -- monitoring needed
2. Data breach scope (0APT, Feb 3) unknown -- add to risk-sentinel weekly scan
3. ARR growth of 6% is underwhelming for cloud transition -- monitoring needed

**Are there CRITICAL unresolved challenges?** The devil's advocate does not have any CRITICAL-severity items that remain completely unresolved. The 4 STRONG challenges are all either accepted as risk (with MoS to compensate) or addressed by the user's more conservative entry target (EUR 15.50 vs EUR 16.50-17.00).

### Moat Assessment Agreement

Moat-assessor: WIDE (22/25). This ALIGNS with thesis. The moat classification is well-evidenced (CATIA aerospace lock-in, SOLIDWORKS installed base, supply chain network effects, efficient scale). The committee agrees the moat is WIDE.

**Key moat insight:** "Revenue vs EPS divergence: Revenue CAGR is 3.2% but EPS CAGR is 8.6%. This suggests margin expansion is driving earnings growth, not top-line growth." This is the central tension -- wide moat protects the business but does not guarantee growth.

### Risk Assessment Agreement

Risk-identifier: HIGH (7 HIGH/CRITICAL risks, 2 CRITICAL). This is the HIGHEST risk score we have seen for any research-stage company. The committee takes this seriously.

**Additional kill conditions suggested by risk-identifier and ADOPTED:**
- Two consecutive quarters of negative revenue growth (actual contraction)
- FY2026 actual revenue growth <3% (below bottom of guidance)
- Medidata goodwill impairment charge
- Loss of Top 5 automotive customer to Siemens
- AI competitor demonstrates viable PLM/CAD at 50%+ lower cost
- Data breach escalation: defense customer loss or regulatory fine >EUR 50M

### Valuation Report Agreement

Valuation-specialist FV: EUR 20.00 (vs thesis EUR 21.00). Committee adopts the valuation-specialist's more conservative FV of EUR 20.00.

Key finding: "DSY.PA's MoS of 12.6% is DRAMATICALLY below all Tier A precedents (minimum 29%)." At EUR 15.50, MoS improves to 22.5% -- still below Tier A precedents but WITHIN Tier B range.

**Verdict: CONDITIONAL PASS. Counter-analysis raises valid concerns, all documented as risks or addressed by the more conservative entry target. No CRITICAL unresolved challenge blocks the standing order at EUR 15.50.**

---

## FINAL VERDICT: APPROVE STANDING ORDER

```
RECOMMENDATION: STANDING ORDER -- BUY ~21 shares of DSY.PA at EUR 15.50 (~EUR 330, ~3.3% of portfolio)

CONDITIONS:
1. Standing order at EUR 15.50 ONLY (NOT at current EUR 17.77)
2. Wait for Q1 2026 results (April-May) -- if Q1 growth <3%, CANCEL standing order
3. If Q1 growth >4%, consider revising entry to EUR 16.00-16.50
4. If data breach (0APT) escalates to defense customer impact, CANCEL standing order
5. Review in 30 days regardless of price action

Quality Score: 70/100 (Tier B) -- per user directive, consistent with tool output
Fair Value: EUR 20.00 (valuation-specialist, committee-adopted)
MoS at EUR 15.50: 22.5% vs Base, -3.1% vs Bear
Category: Wide-Moat Mature Software (NOT "quality compounder" given 3.2% growth)
Risk Profile: HIGH (7 HIGH/CRITICAL risks)
Primary Risk: Revenue growth structural deceleration (4-year trend, flat EPS guidance)
Kill Conditions: 8 defined (see Gate 9)

Precedent Sizing: HRB at QS 70 was 3.8% initial -> DSY at 3.3% is slightly smaller
                   (more cautious given HIGH risk and falling knife)

Standing Order Details:
  Ticker: DSY.PA
  Entry: EUR 15.50
  Shares: ~21 (EUR 330)
  Valid until: Q1 2026 results (April-May), then review
  Cancel if: Q1 revenue growth <3% or data breach escalation
```

### Why APPROVE (Standing Order) and not WATCHLIST ONLY?

1. **The moat is genuinely wide (22/25).** This is the strongest moat evidence we have seen for any research candidate. CATIA's aerospace lock-in, SOLIDWORKS' 6M+ users, supply chain network effects, and 40-year market stability are world-class competitive advantages.

2. **EUR 15.50 provides adequate MoS for Tier B.** At 22.5%, the MoS is within the 20-25% Tier B acceptance range. It is conservative relative to current price (EUR 17.77, which would give only 12.6% MoS -- insufficient).

3. **Balance sheet eliminates permanent capital loss risk.** Net cash EUR 1.3-1.5B, EUR 1.5B annual FCF, 30% payout ratio. Even in the bear case (growth stalls at 2-3%), the company generates massive cash flow and has zero debt risk.

4. **48.8% family ownership provides aligned, patient stewardship.** The Dassault family has managed this business for 40+ years with disciplined capital allocation. They can invest through the transition without quarterly pressure.

5. **The market prices in 1-2% perpetual growth at EUR 17.77.** At EUR 15.50, the implied growth is even more pessimistic. For a #1 global PLM franchise with 82% recurring revenue and 83.7% gross margins, this is excessively bearish.

6. **Sizing at 3.3% limits risk.** If the bear case materializes (EUR 16.00), we lose ~0.5% of portfolio. If the base materializes (EUR 20.00), we gain ~9.5% of portfolio contribution. The asymmetry is favorable.

7. **44% cash means we can afford selective deployment.** This is not forced capital deployment. It is a disciplined standing order at a price that provides adequate MoS, with conditions for cancellation.

### Why NOT BUY at current price (EUR 17.77)?

1. MoS of 12.6% is insufficient for Tier B (precedent: 20-25% minimum)
2. Falling knife -- the stock dropped 21% today, follow-through selling likely
3. No near-term catalyst for re-rating
4. User directive confirms patience (wait for Q1 results)
5. Bear case (EUR 16.00) only 10% below current price -- poor asymmetry

## META-REFLECTION

### Dudas sobre esta decision

1. **Am I being too conservative or not conservative enough?** FV EUR 20.00 is 38% below Morningstar EUR 32.50 and 36% below consensus EUR 31.10. If they are right, we are leaving massive upside on the table by demanding EUR 15.50. But the adversarial program taught us that our own FV estimates were inflated by avg -19%. Being 35-40% below consensus may be exactly the right level of conservatism.

2. **Will EUR 15.50 ever be reached?** The stock is at EUR 17.77 today after a -21% crash. EUR 15.50 requires another -13% decline. This could happen if: (a) follow-through selling in coming weeks, (b) Q1 2026 disappoints, (c) broader market correction. But it might NOT happen if the stock stabilizes at current levels. The risk of the standing order is that we miss the opportunity entirely. At 44% cash, this is an acceptable risk -- we are not desperate to deploy.

3. **Is the 3DEXPERIENCE decline (-3% Q4) a bigger problem than acknowledged?** If the flagship cloud platform is shrinking, the entire "cloud transition will eventually lift growth" thesis is in question. This was not adequately addressed in the thesis. If Q1 2026 shows continued 3DEXPERIENCE decline, the thesis weakens materially.

4. **Data breach scope (0APT, Feb 3, 2026).** This is completely unknown and could be anywhere from noise to catastrophic for defense customer relationships. It should be added to risk-sentinel's weekly scan immediately.

### Debilidades del analisis recibido

1. **Thesis adjusts QS from 70 to 78 at a tier boundary.** This is the EXACT pattern the adversarial program identified (Error #43). While the adjustment is factually defensible (DSY IS #1 in PLM), the committee should ALWAYS be skeptical of QS adjustments that change tier classifications. The user's directive to treat as Tier B is the correct decision.

2. **Thesis uses Adobe parallel as emotional anchor.** The devil's advocate convincingly demonstrates that the Adobe parallel is structurally flawed in multiple dimensions (speed, customer type, TAM expansion, ARR trajectory). The committee strips this parallel from the decision framework.

3. **Thesis FV of EUR 21.00 uses 5% growth base case** -- this is the TOP of management guidance. The valuation-specialist's EUR 20.00 (anchored to 4% growth, 8.5% WACC) is more honest.

4. **Medidata competitive dynamics insufficiently analyzed.** Veeva's growing market share and Siemens Dotmatics' entry are material competitive threats to 15-17% of DSY revenue. The thesis acknowledges Medidata weakness but underweights competitive evidence.

5. **No IFRS-based valuation alongside Non-IFRS.** The EUR 429M gap between IFRS and Non-IFRS earnings (SBC + Medidata amortization) is real. At IFRS P/E 22x (at FV EUR 20.00), the stock is not obviously cheap. The valuation-specialist flags this but it deserves more weight.

### Sugerencias de mejora

1. **quality_scorer.py market_position should require manual input.** The tool gives 0/8 for all companies by default (corrected from previous 5/8 bias). A `--market-position` CLI flag would eliminate the need for manual adjustments at tier boundaries.

2. **For future analyses with IFRS vs Non-IFRS gap >20%, require both bases in valuation.** This prevents over-reliance on Non-IFRS flattering figures.

3. **Add 3DEXPERIENCE platform growth as a monitoring metric for DSY.PA.** If the cloud platform shrinks in Q1 2026, the thesis weakens materially.

4. **The data breach should be added to risk-sentinel's weekly scan immediately** -- regardless of whether we set the standing order.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator

1. Should DSY.PA be added to the standing_orders section of state/system.yaml with entry EUR 15.50 and the cancellation conditions documented above?
2. Should the data breach (0APT, Feb 3) be added to risk-sentinel's watch list?
3. Should we set a calendar reminder for "Q1 2026 DSY.PA results -- review standing order" in April-May 2026?
