## TL;DR

Dassault Systemes is the global leader in PLM/3D design software (CATIA, SOLIDWORKS, 3DEXPERIENCE) with 83.7% gross margins, EUR 1.5B FCF, net cash of EUR 1.5B, and 49% family ownership. The stock dropped 21% today to its lowest level since 2020 after Q4 revenue growth of only +1% (vs +3% expected) and soft FY2026 guidance of 3-5% growth. The market is punishing a cloud transition that temporarily depresses license revenue -- a pattern identical to Adobe in 2012-2014. At EUR 17.77, the stock trades at 12x non-IFRS EPS, its cheapest valuation in over a decade, while the business continues to generate world-class margins and cash flow with a near-impregnable moat.

## Quality Score

```
QS Tool: 70/100 (Tier B)
QS Adjusted: 78/100 (Tier A) -- Adjustment: +8 points with documented evidence below
```

**Adjustment justification (quantitative evidence):**

1. **Market Position: +8 points (0/8 -> 8/8).** The tool assigns 0/8 because it cannot auto-detect market position. Dassault Systemes is the undisputed #1 in PLM software globally (16.5% market share per ABI Research). 90% of aircraft and 80% of automobiles worldwide are designed using Dassault software (Morningstar, multiple sources). This is not a debatable point -- it is the single most dominant franchise in engineering software. Per the QS framework, #1-2 position = 8 points. Tool bias: market_position default was identified in Session 52 as a structural flaw (Error #43 in decisions_log: "market_position default = 5/8 free points for ALL companies" -- but here the tool gives 0/8, the opposite problem for a clear market leader).

2. **ROIC spread assessment is CONFIRMED by tool: +9.2pp.** This gets 8/15 per the scoring grid. No adjustment needed here.

3. **Revenue CAGR 3.2% gets 2/10.** This IS genuinely low. However, the 3.2% CAGR reflects a cloud transition period (license revenue declining, subscription +11% growing). Reported CAGR understates underlying growth: subscription ARR growing 6%+. I am NOT adjusting this -- the tool correctly penalizes low reported growth. The market will not care about "underlying" growth until it shows up in reported numbers.

**QS Adjusted: 70 + 8 (market position) = 78/100 -> Tier A (borderline)**

**IMPORTANT CAVEAT:** 78 is borderline Tier A. The revenue growth weakness is real, not just optical. If FY2026 delivers below 3% growth, this drops back to Tier B. I am treating this as **Tier A with elevated uncertainty** -- which means the MoS requirement should be at the higher end of Tier A precedents (closer to 30% than 15%).

## Business Understanding

### What Dassault Systemes Actually Does

Dassault Systemes provides software that enables companies to design, simulate, manufacture, and manage physical products in the virtual world before building them in the real world. The concept is the "virtual twin" -- a physics-accurate digital replica of a product, factory, or even a city.

**Core Products:**

| Product | What It Does | Market Position | Revenue Share |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **CATIA** | 3D design for complex products (aircraft, cars) | #1 in aerospace/auto 3D design | ~25% of revenue |
| **SOLIDWORKS** | 3D CAD for mid-market engineers | #1 mid-market 3D CAD (6M+ users) | ~22% of revenue |
| **ENOVIA** | PLM lifecycle management | Top 3 PLM | ~12% of revenue |
| **SIMULIA** | Simulation/physics modeling | Top 3 simulation | ~10% of revenue |
| **DELMIA** | Manufacturing/supply chain digital twins | Strong niche | ~8% of revenue |
| **Medidata** | Life sciences clinical trials platform | #1 clinical trials software | ~17% of revenue |
| **3DEXPERIENCE** | Unified cloud platform connecting all above | Growing 32% cloud | Platform layer |

**Revenue Segments (FY2025):**
- Industrial Innovation: EUR 3.13B (+6%) -- CATIA, SIMULIA, DELMIA, the core
- Life Sciences: EUR 1.08B (-2%) -- Medidata, the problem child
- Mainstream Innovation: EUR 1.43B (+2%) -- SOLIDWORKS, the cash cow

### Revenue Model

- **82% recurring revenue** (subscriptions + support contracts)
- Subscription growing +11%, now 49% of recurring
- License revenue declining -6% (transitioning to subscription)
- Services: EUR 595M (10% of revenue)
- Annual Run Rate (ARR): EUR 4.50B, growing 6%

### Unit Economics

This is an enterprise software business with extreme unit economics:
- **Gross Margin: 83.7%** -- stable for 4+ years, +28.7pp vs sector median
- **FCF Margin: 23.6%** -- consistently above 23% for 4 years
- **Net Dollar Retention: estimated 95%+** (inferred from recurring revenue stability)
- **Switching costs: EXTREME** -- it costs millions of dollars and years of retraining to switch from CATIA to a competitor. Engineering workflows, decades of design files, trained workforce, regulatory compliance records -- all locked in.

### Why This Is (Nearly) a Monopoly

1. **90% of aircraft designed on CATIA.** Boeing, Airbus, Lockheed, Dassault Aviation, Safran -- they ALL use CATIA. Switching is not a cost issue, it is a safety and certification issue. Aviation regulators require traceability of design data.

2. **80% of automobiles designed with Dassault software.** Toyota, BMW, Mercedes, Stellantis, Hyundai -- the global auto industry runs on CATIA.

3. **SOLIDWORKS has 6M+ users** and is embedded in 80% of top engineering schools globally. Students learn SOLIDWORKS, then bring it to their employers. This creates a generational lock-in.

4. **Medidata runs 25,000+ clinical trials.** Half of all new drugs approved by the FDA in recent years were developed using Medidata. Regulatory submission data is locked into the platform.

5. **3DEXPERIENCE platform** -- the strategy is to create a unified platform connecting all products, making the switching cost even higher (you cannot switch one product without switching the ecosystem).

### The NVIDIA Partnership (Announced Feb 3, 2026)

This is a potentially transformative development announced just one week before the Q4 miss:
- **Industrial AI Platform:** Combining Dassault's Virtual Twin with NVIDIA's AI infrastructure
- **Industry World Models:** Science-validated digital twins running on NVIDIA-accelerated compute
- **Physical AI:** Autonomous, software-defined production systems
- **NVIDIA BioNeMo + Dassault Biovia:** Drug discovery acceleration
- **OUTSCALE sovereign cloud:** NVIDIA-powered AI factories on 3 continents
- Jensen Huang (NVIDIA CEO) said at 3DEXPERIENCE World: "Everything will be represented in a virtual twin"

This partnership positions Dassault at the center of the "industrial metaverse" -- the convergence of AI + simulation + manufacturing. The revenue impact is 2-3 years out, but it validates the strategic direction.

## Por Que Esta Barata -- CRITICAL ANALYSIS

### The Market's Narrative

1. **Q4 revenue miss: +1% vs +3% expected.** This was "worse than even the most negative had feared" (JPMorgan). Below even bearish buyside expectations.

2. **FY2026 guidance of 3-5% disappoints.** Consensus was 5.8% growth (Bloomberg). The midpoint of 4% is significantly below expectations.

3. **Life Sciences/Medidata declining.** Life Sciences revenue -2% FY2025. Medidata -7% in Q4. Pharma companies cutting clinical trial starts.

4. **European auto sector weakness.** Dassault's core auto customer base is in a manufacturing recession. European auto sector is deeply depressed.

5. **Cloud transition depressing near-term growth.** License revenue -6% as customers shift to subscriptions. Short-term pain for long-term benefit.

### My Counter-Thesis

**For each concern:**

**1. Q4 miss is cyclical, not structural.**
- Industrial Innovation (core business) grew +6% FY2025. The miss was concentrated in Medidata (-2%) and Mainstream Innovation (+2% = SOLIDWORKS slowdown).
- SOLIDWORKS weakness is tied to European manufacturing recession, which is cyclical.
- Cloud transition is the primary drag: 3DEXPERIENCE Cloud +32%, but this cannibalizes higher-value license sales in the near term.
- Probability I am wrong: 25% -- if the weakness is structural (AI disruption of CAD), this could persist.

**2. Guidance is conservatively set by management with a track record of beating.**
- Dassault management has historically guided conservatively. They guided FY2025 at 5-6% and delivered 4% -- so yes, they sometimes miss even conservative guidance.
- However, the midpoint of 4% growth on a EUR 6.2B base is EUR 6.45B -- achievable if the NVIDIA partnership starts generating deals.
- Probability I am wrong: 30% -- the guidance could be achievable but still below consensus.

**3. Medidata decline is being addressed.**
- Management is pivoting Medidata from clinical-trial-dependent to enterprise PLM for life sciences.
- Enterprise life sciences grew +3% within the segment.
- This is a multi-year transition. Medidata was acquired for $5.8B in 2019 and has been a drag.
- Probability I am wrong: 35% -- Medidata could be a structural problem, not just a transition.

**4. European auto weakness is cyclical.**
- Germany projecting +1.0-1.4% GDP growth in 2026 (from recession in 2023-2024).
- EUR 500B infrastructure stimulus approved.
- EV transition requires MORE design software, not less (more complex vehicles).
- Probability I am wrong: 20% -- the auto cycle will recover, the question is timing.

**5. Cloud transition IS the Adobe parallel.**
- Adobe went through this exact pain in 2012-2014. Stock went from $30 to $20 as license revenue cratered during the Creative Cloud transition. Then it went from $20 to $700.
- Dassault's subscription growing +11%, cloud +32%, 3DEXPERIENCE Cloud +32%. These are STRONG leading indicators.
- Cloud = higher recurring revenue, better retention, more upselling, higher long-term margins.
- Probability I am wrong: 15% -- the cloud transition is clearly working, the question is pace.

### Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | SI/NO | Comment |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Industry in secular decline | NO | PLM market growing 5-9% CAGR |
| Technological disruption imminent | NO | AI is opportunity (NVIDIA partnership), not threat |
| Management destroying value | NO | Family-controlled, patient, disciplined |
| Balance deteriorating | NO | Net cash EUR 1.5B |
| Insider selling massively | NO | 49% family ownership, aligned |
| Dividend cut recent/probable | NO | 30% payout ratio, conservative |
| Market share loss >2pp 3yr | NO | #1 PLM position stable |
| ROIC < WACC last 3 years | NO | ROIC 16.4% vs WACC 7.2% = +9.2pp spread |
| FCF negative >2 years | NO | 4/4 years positive, EUR 1.5B annual |
| Goodwill >50% equity | **PARTIAL** | Goodwill EUR 11.6B (~70% of equity). Mostly Medidata acquisition. |

**Value Trap Score: 0.5/10** -- Extremely low risk. Goodwill is the only concern, and it is primarily one acquisition (Medidata) that generates cash.

### My Edge / Informational Advantage

- **Longer time horizon.** The market is pricing a 2026 growth miss. I am pricing a 3-5 year cloud transition that should accelerate revenue and margins.
- **Understand the Adobe parallel.** The cloud transition pain is well-understood from Adobe's experience. Dassault is going through the same playbook.
- **NVIDIA partnership is underappreciated.** Announced Feb 3, just 8 days before the Q4 miss. The market is focused on the negative earnings, not the positive strategic development.
- **Family ownership provides patience.** The Dassault family (49%) can afford to invest for the long term without quarterly pressure.

## Projections

### Revenue Projection (derived from business logic)

**TAM Analysis:**
- PLM software market: ~$46-75B (varies by scope), growing 5-9% CAGR
- Dassault's addressable market includes PLM, simulation, life sciences, manufacturing -- conservatively $60B+
- Market share: ~16.5% (stable)

**Revenue Growth Derivation:**
```
TAM Growth: +6% CAGR (midpoint of 5-9% estimates)
Market Share: Stable (0%) -- Siemens Altair acquisition + PTC competition offsets Dassault's cloud strength
Pricing Power: +2% (embedded switching costs, annual price escalators)
Cloud Transition Impact: -1% near-term (license cannibalization), +2% long-term (upselling, retention)

Year 1-2 (transition trough): +4% revenue growth
Year 3-5 (cloud acceleration): +6-7% revenue growth
Year 6-10 (mature): +5% revenue growth
```

**Margin Projection:**
- Current operating margin (non-IFRS): 32%
- Cloud transition should improve margins long-term (less perpetual license support, more subscription leverage)
- Guidance FY2026: 32.2-32.6% operating margin = STABLE to slightly expanding
- Year 3-5 target: 33-34% (conservative vs management aspiration of 35%+)
- FCF margin: stable at 23-24%, potentially expanding to 25%+ as cloud scales

### WACC Derivation

```
Risk-Free Rate (EUR): 2.8% (German 10Y bund)
Beta: 0.55 (from tool -- very defensive, consistent with enterprise software)
Equity Risk Premium: 5.5% (Europe)
Ke = 2.8% + 0.55 * 5.5% = 5.8%

Note: Beta of 0.55 is VERY low. This reflects the defensive nature of the business
(recurring revenue, mission-critical software). For conservatism, I will use beta 0.7
in my custom WACC (not the tool's 0.55).

Adjusted Ke = 2.8% + 0.7 * 5.5% = 6.65%

Cost of Debt: 5.5% (default from tool -- Dassault has minimal debt, mostly net cash)
Tax Rate: 18.6% (from tool)
After-tax Kd = 5.5% * (1 - 0.186) = 4.48%

Capital Structure: ~95% equity, ~5% debt (net cash company)
WACC = 0.95 * 6.65% + 0.05 * 4.48% = 6.5%

For conservatism in valuation: I will use WACC range of 7.0-8.5%
(adding 0.5-2.0pp for execution risk on cloud transition and Medidata uncertainty)
```

### EPS Projection

```
FY2025 IFRS EPS: EUR 0.91
FY2025 Non-IFRS EPS: EUR 1.31

FY2026E Non-IFRS EPS: EUR 1.30-1.34 (guidance)
FY2027E: EUR 1.40-1.48 (6-10% growth as cloud transition accelerates)
FY2028E: EUR 1.52-1.63 (8-10% growth)
FY2029E: EUR 1.63-1.79 (7-10% growth)
FY2030E: EUR 1.74-1.97 (7-10% growth)
```

## Valuation

### Method 1: DCF with Derived Parameters (Weight: 50%)

**DCF Results Summary (from tool runs):**

| Parameters | Growth | WACC | Terminal | Base FV | MoS |
|-----------|--------|------|----------|---------|-----|
| Conservative | 4% | 9.0% | 2.0% | EUR 18.72 | +5.4% |
| Moderate | 5% | 8.5% | 2.5% | EUR 22.25 | +25.2% |
| Very Conservative | 3% | 8.5% | 2.0% | EUR 19.29 | +8.6% |
| Ultra Conservative | 2% | 8.5% | 2.0% | EUR 18.52 | +4.2% |

**DCF Sensitivity Assessment:**
- FV Spread: 69-78% -- HIGH SENSITIVITY
- Terminal Value as % of EV: 72-76% -- HIGH (typical for low-growth DCF)
- This means the DCF is UNRELIABLE as a point estimate. I must use a range.

**My DCF Fair Value Range:** EUR 18.50 - 22.50
- Conservative case (4% growth, 9% WACC): EUR 18.72
- Base case (5% growth, 8.5% WACC): EUR 22.25
- I weight toward the conservative end: **DCF Fair Value = EUR 20.00**

**Reverse DCF Analysis:**
At EUR 17.77, the market implies:
- ~2% growth perpetuity at 8.5% WACC (FV = EUR 18.52 at 2% growth)
- This means the market is pricing Dassault for ZERO growth above inflation
- For a #1 PLM company with 83% gross margins and a cloud transition underway, this is extremely pessimistic

### Method 2: EV/EBIT Comparison vs Peers (Weight: 30%)

**Current EV/EBIT for Dassault:**
- Market Cap: EUR 23.4B
- Net Cash: EUR 1.5B
- EV = EUR 21.9B
- Non-IFRS EBIT (FY2025) = EUR 6.24B * 32% = EUR 2.0B
- EV/EBIT = 21.9/2.0 = **10.9x**

**Peer Comparison:**

| Company | EV/EBIT (LTM) | P/E | Growth | GM |
|---------|---------------|-----|--------|-----|
| Dassault (DSY.PA) | ~11x | 20x (IFRS), 13.6x (non-IFRS) | 4% | 84% |
| PTC Inc | ~21x | 23x | 8-10% | 80% |
| Cadence Design | ~55x+ | 76x | 15%+ | 90%+ |
| Siemens (overall) | ~15x | - | - | - |

**Dassault trades at roughly HALF the EV/EBIT of PTC**, its most direct competitor. Even applying a 20-30% discount for lower growth, Dassault deserves at least 15-17x EV/EBIT based on quality (margins, cash flow, market position).

**EV/EBIT Fair Value:**
- At 15x EV/EBIT: EV = EUR 30.0B, Equity = EUR 31.5B, FV = EUR 23.9/share
- At 13x EV/EBIT: EV = EUR 26.0B, Equity = EUR 27.5B, FV = EUR 20.9/share
- At 17x EV/EBIT: EV = EUR 34.0B, Equity = EUR 35.5B, FV = EUR 26.9/share

**EV/EBIT Fair Value: EUR 22.00** (using 14x, conservative vs 15x midpoint, reflecting growth concerns)

### Method 3: Owner Earnings Yield (Weight: 20%)

```
FCF = EUR 1.5B
Depreciation = ~EUR 250M (estimated from capex patterns)
Maintenance Capex ~ EUR 250M * 1.1 = EUR 275M
Owner Earnings = EUR 1.5B - 275M + 250M = EUR 1.475B

At current market cap EUR 23.4B:
OEY = EUR 1.475B / EUR 23.4B = 6.3%

Expected Growth (next 5 years): 5-6% (non-IFRS EPS CAGR)

OEY + Growth = 6.3% + 5.5% = 11.8%
vs WACC of 6.5-8.5%

Spread: +3.3% to +5.3% -> ATTRACTIVE for a quality compounder
```

For context, precedent OEY + Growth levels at purchase:
- ADBE: 16.5% (exceptional)
- BYIT.L: 14.4% (strong)
- AUTO.L: high (50% FCF margin)
- DSY.PA at 11.8% is lower than our best, but still well above cost of capital

### Reconciliation

| Method | Fair Value | Weight | Weighted |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| DCF (conservative) | EUR 20.00 | 50% | EUR 10.00 |
| EV/EBIT (14x) | EUR 22.00 | 30% | EUR 6.60 |
| OEY + Growth | N/A (qualitative) | 20% | supports ~EUR 20-22 range |
| **Weighted Average** | | 100% | **EUR 20.75** |

**Rounding conservatively: Fair Value = EUR 21.00**

Morningstar fair value: EUR 32.50 (wide moat rating) -- note this is 55% above my estimate. I consider Morningstar too generous; they assume faster growth normalization.

Analyst consensus target: EUR 31.10 -- also much higher than my estimate. I consider sell-side overoptimistic; they had 5.8% growth before the guide-down.

**My FV of EUR 21.00 is deliberately conservative.** The adversarial program showed 14/16 theses had inflated FV by avg -19%. I am anchoring to the DCF conservative case.

## Scenarios

| | Bear (25%) | Base (50%) | Bull (25%) |
|--|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Assumption** | Medidata continues declining, auto recovery delayed to 2028, cloud transition slower than Adobe's. Revenue CAGR 2-3%. | Cloud transition tracks as expected, auto recovers H2 2026, Medidata stabilizes. Revenue CAGR 4-5%. | NVIDIA partnership generates material revenue, cloud transition accelerates, margins expand to 34%+. Revenue CAGR 7-8%. |
| **FV** | EUR 16.00 | EUR 21.00 | EUR 28.00 |
| **Probability** | 25% | 50% | 25% |

**Expected Value = (EUR 16.00 * 25%) + (EUR 21.00 * 50%) + (EUR 28.00 * 25%) = EUR 21.50**

### MoS Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current Price | EUR 17.77 |
| vs Base FV (EUR 21.00) | +18.2% MoS |
| vs Expected Value (EUR 21.50) | +21.0% MoS |
| vs Bear FV (EUR 16.00) | -10.0% (BELOW bear case) |

**Key observation:** The price is BELOW my base fair value but ABOVE my bear case. This means there is MoS vs base, but the bear case is not far below the current price. If Medidata continues declining and auto does not recover, downside to EUR 16 (-10%) is real.

---

## MoS Assessment

```
MoS vs Base: +18.2%
MoS vs Bear: -10.0%
MoS vs Expected Value: +21.0%
```

**Precedent comparison for Tier A purchases:**
- ADBE: 31% MoS, QS 76
- NVO: 38% MoS, QS 82
- MONY.L: 36% MoS, QS 81
- LULU: 34% MoS, QS 82
- AUTO.L: 29% MoS, QS 79
- BYIT.L: 35% MoS, QS 81

**DSY.PA at 18% MoS and QS 78 is BELOW all Tier A precedents.**

This is the key tension: DSY.PA is a higher-quality business than most of our Tier A holdings (wider moat, more recurring, 49% insider, net cash), but the MoS is thinner.

**The reason is that the market already valued DSY.PA at a premium (it was at EUR 40 a year ago), so even a 56% drawdown does not create the same MoS as a BYIT.L at 14x P/E.**

---

## Risk Assessment (Integrated)

### 1. Cloud Transition Execution Risk
- **Risk:** Transition slower than expected, license revenue falls faster than subscription grows
- **Probability:** MEDIUM (30%)
- **Impact:** Revenue stagnation at 2-3%, multiple compression
- **Mitigation:** 3DEXPERIENCE Cloud +32% growth, subscription +11% -- leading indicators are positive

### 2. Revenue Growth Deceleration
- **Risk:** 3.2% CAGR continues or worsens, "compounder" narrative breaks
- **Probability:** MEDIUM (35%)
- **Impact:** If growth stuck at 3%, this is a EUR 18-20 stock, not EUR 25+
- **Mitigation:** Cloud transition should unlock faster growth Y3+. But this is FAITH, not evidence yet.

### 3. European Tech Discount
- **Risk:** Market perpetually undervalues European software vs US peers
- **Probability:** HIGH (60%)
- **Impact:** Fair multiple remains depressed (13-15x EV/EBIT vs 20x+ for US peers)
- **Mitigation:** This is partially offset by lower beta and dividend income

### 4. Competition from Siemens Xcelerator
- **Risk:** Siemens acquired Altair ($10.6B) in 2025, creating strongest AI-powered simulation suite
- **Probability:** MEDIUM (30%)
- **Impact:** Could erode Dassault's simulation leadership (SIMULIA)
- **Mitigation:** Dassault's CATIA/SOLIDWORKS moat in design is separate from simulation. NVIDIA partnership is Dassault's AI response.

### 5. Medidata Structural Decline
- **Risk:** Medidata ($5.8B acquisition) cannot pivot from clinical trials to enterprise PLM
- **Probability:** MEDIUM-HIGH (40%)
- **Impact:** ~17% of revenue base stays flat or declines, dragging overall growth to 3%
- **Mitigation:** Enterprise life sciences growing +3% within segment. But Medidata was overpaid for.

### 6. Groupe Dassault Governance
- **Risk:** 49% family control could lead to decisions favoring the family over minorities
- **Probability:** LOW (10%)
- **Impact:** Limited -- family has been excellent stewards for 40+ years
- **Mitigation:** Track record of reinvestment, no excessive dividends, no related-party transactions

### 7. Macro: European Manufacturing Recession
- **Risk:** Auto sector stays depressed through 2027
- **Probability:** MEDIUM (30%)
- **Impact:** SOLIDWORKS/CATIA auto revenue stays flat
- **Mitigation:** German EUR 500B stimulus, EV transition requires more design complexity

### 8. Currency Risk
- **Risk:** EUR reporting but ~60% non-EUR revenue (USD, JPY, CNY)
- **Probability:** N/A (ongoing)
- **Impact:** FX swings can move reported revenue by 1-3pp
- **Mitigation:** Natural hedge through global cost base

---

## Kill Conditions

1. **ROIC falls below WACC for 2 consecutive years** (currently +9.2pp spread -- far from kill)
2. **Recurring revenue growth turns negative** (currently +6% -- would signal structural customer churn)
3. **CATIA loses major aerospace program** (e.g., Airbus switches to Siemens NX for a major aircraft program)
4. **FCF declines >20% in a single year without acquisition-related explanation**
5. **Groupe Dassault begins related-party transactions or excessive dividends (>60% payout)**
6. **Cloud transition fails:** 3DEXPERIENCE Cloud growth decelerates to <15% for 2 consecutive quarters

## Catalizadores

| Catalyst | Timeline | Probability | Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------|--------|
| European auto recovery | H2 2026-2027 | 60% | +5-10% to FV |

## Fit with Macro Context

- **World view (Feb 5):** Late cycle, tariffs escalating, ECB holding at 2%. European manufacturing weak but improving (Germany +1.0-1.4% growth projected). This is broadly neutral for DSY.PA.
- **Tech sector view:** NEUTRAL -- selective in quality compounders. DSY.PA fits the "quality compounder castigated by market" thesis described in the sector view.
- **Portfolio context:** If purchased at ~EUR 400 (~22 shares), this would be 4.0% of portfolio. Technology sector would go to 12.0% (from 8.0% with ADBE and BYIT.L). EU geographic exposure would increase modestly.
- **Principle 2 (Geography):** DSY.PA is French-listed but 60%+ of revenue is non-EU. It is a global business. Adding it increases EU listed exposure but not EU economic exposure.
- **Principle 3 (Sector):** Technology at 12% is reasonable. ADBE (Creative), BYIT.L (IT services), DSY.PA (PLM) are three different sub-sectors with low correlation.
- **Principle 9 (Quality Gravitation):** At QS 78, this would be a Tier A (borderline) position. It fits the portfolio's strategic direction toward quality compounders.

---

## Veredicto: WATCHLIST (Entry EUR 16.50-17.00)

### Reasoning

The thesis for DSY.PA is STRONG from a quality perspective:
- #1 global PLM franchise with near-monopoly in aerospace/auto
- 84% gross margins, 24% FCF margin, net cash, 49% insider ownership
- NVIDIA partnership positions it at the center of industrial AI
- Cloud transition is working (subscription +11%, 3DEXPERIENCE Cloud +32%)
- Wide moat (Morningstar agrees)

However, the MoS at EUR 17.77 is **insufficient for our portfolio's precedents:**
- 18% MoS is below ALL six Tier A precedents (minimum was AUTO.L at 29%)
- The bear case (EUR 16.00) is only 10% below current price
- Revenue growth of 3.2% is genuinely concerning for a "compounder" -- if this persists, the stock deserves its current multiple
- High DCF sensitivity (FV spread 69-78%) means the fair value estimate is uncertain

**Why not BUY today:**

1. **MoS Gap vs Precedents.** Our Tier A precedents range from 29-38% MoS. At 18%, DSY.PA would be our lowest-conviction Tier A entry. Post-adversarial, we should be MORE conservative, not less.

2. **Falling knife risk.** The stock dropped 21% TODAY. There is often follow-through selling in the next 1-3 weeks as analysts cut targets and funds rebalance.

3. **Q1 2026 could disappoint further.** If FY2026 tracks toward the low end of 3-5% guidance, the stock could test EUR 15-16.

4. **Revenue growth uncertainty.** Until subscription growth accelerates reported revenue growth above 5%, the "compounder" narrative remains broken.

**Entry target: EUR 16.50-17.00** (MoS = 19-24% vs my conservative FV, 24-27% vs base)

This would provide:
- At EUR 17.00: MoS 19% vs FV EUR 21.00, MoS 24% vs EV EUR 22.50
- At EUR 16.50: MoS 21% vs FV EUR 21.00, MoS 27% vs EV EUR 22.50
- Bear case downside: -3% to EUR 16.00 (acceptable)

**Standing Order:** BUY 22 shares at EUR 17.00 (total ~EUR 374, ~3.5% of portfolio)

This prices in further selling pressure while capturing the opportunity before it bounces. If it never hits EUR 17.00, we miss a good but not exceptional entry. The opportunity cost is low given 44% cash.

## 🔄 META-REFLECTION

### Incertidumbres/Dudas

1. **Revenue CAGR of 3.2% -- is this a trough or the new normal?** The cloud transition and Medidata weakness both depress growth, but I cannot quantify when they reverse. If DSY grows at 3% for 3 more years, my FV is too high. If cloud accelerates to 8%+ growth by 2028, my FV is too low. This is the central uncertainty.

2. **Goodwill of EUR 11.6B (~70% of equity).** Almost entirely from the Medidata acquisition. If Medidata continues declining, there is impairment risk. I did not model impairment because management is pivoting the business, but this is a real risk.

3. **The QS adjustment from 70 to 78.** The +8 points for market position is fully justified by data (90% of aircraft, 80% of autos, #1 PLM). However, I am aware this is exactly the pattern the adversarial program identified: adjusting QS upward. The difference here is that the tool gives 0/8 for market position (a known flaw), not 5/8. Still, I flag this as a potential bias.

4. **NVIDIA partnership revenue timing.** Jensen Huang's endorsement is bullish, but partnerships between platform companies often take 2-4 years to materialize in revenue. I gave this only 50% probability and 2027-2028 timeline, but the market may not wait that long.

5. **Non-IFRS vs IFRS divergence.** Non-IFRS EPS EUR 1.31 vs IFRS EPS EUR 0.91 -- a 44% gap. The non-IFRS excludes amortization of acquired intangibles (Medidata), stock-based compensation, and restructuring. The FCF figures I use are IFRS-based (operating cash flow EUR 1.63B), so the valuation should be consistent. But the P/E of 20x on IFRS vs 13.6x on non-IFRS creates confusion.

### Sugerencias para el Sistema

1. **The quality_scorer.py tool should have market position as a required manual input rather than defaulting to 0.** Currently it gives 0/8 for all companies (or 5/8 per the bias noted in Session 52). This forces manual adjustment every time and creates inconsistency. Suggestion: add `--market-position` CLI flag with options 1-2, 3-5, 6-10, >10.

2. **DCF sensitivity of 69-78% and TV >72% makes the DCF near-useless as a point estimate for stable but slow-growing companies.** The tool should warn when TV exceeds 70% that the user should rely more on multiples-based methods.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator

1. Should we set a standing order at EUR 17.00, or wait for further analysis (devil's advocate, investment committee) before committing?
2. Should this thesis trigger a sector view update for technology.md? DSY.PA was already listed as a priority candidate.
3. With 44% cash, should we consider a small initial position (1.5-2%) at current price (EUR 17.77) with ADD at EUR 16.50?

### Anomalias Detectadas

1. **Morningstar FV EUR 32.50 vs my FV EUR 21.00 -- 55% gap.** This is an enormous divergence. Morningstar assigns wide moat and assumes higher long-term growth. I should investigate their assumptions more closely to understand why they are so much higher. If they are right and I am wrong, I am leaving 80%+ upside on the table at current prices.

2. **Analyst consensus target EUR 31.10 is also far above my estimate.** 12 out of 25 analysts rate BUY. The consensus may be overly anchored to historical multiples (DSY traded at 30-40x non-IFRS P/E historically). My 13.6x non-IFRS P/E assumption may be too harsh for a wide-moat compounder.

3. **The stock is at EUR 17.77 but touched EUR 17.16 (52w low).** This is only 3.6% above the absolute low. If it breaks EUR 17.16, there is no technical support until the COVID low of ~EUR 13-14 (2020). This creates asymmetric risk in the very near term.
