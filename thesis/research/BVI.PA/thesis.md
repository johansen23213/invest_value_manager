# BVI.PA - Bureau Veritas SA

## TL;DR

Bureau Veritas is a EUR 12.1B global Testing, Inspection, and Certification (TIC) company with a NARROW-to-WIDE moat built on regulatory mandates, accreditations, and global laboratory networks. ROIC-WACC spread of +11.8pp, 72% gross margins, and 10.2% organic growth in 2024 demonstrate quality. At EUR 27.20, the stock trades at 18.8x P/E, ~13% below 52-week highs, with EUR 33 fair value offering 21% MoS. Earnings on Feb 25, 2026 will confirm trajectory. Entry at EUR 24 requires 12% decline but is achievable on any market-wide selloff.

## Quality Score

**QS Tool: 69/100 (Tier B)**
**QS Adjusted: 73/100 (Tier B, upper end)**

### Adjustment: +4 points

| Category | Tool | Adjustment | Adjusted | Rationale |
|----------|------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Moat - Market Position | 0/8 | +4 | 4/8 | BVI.PA is #2 globally in TIC (behind SGS). Top 3 hold ~23% of a $240B+ market. The tool defaults market_position to 0 (known bias from Session 52). +4 is conservative for a clear #2 global position (not +5 for #1-2 because not clear #1). |
| Total | 69 | +4 | **73** | |

No adjustment warranted: This is 4 points, below the 5-point threshold requiring heavy evidence. The market position of BVI.PA as world's #2 TIC company is well-documented and unambiguous (445,000+ employees, 1,600+ offices, 85+ countries).

## Business Understanding

### What Bureau Veritas Does

Bureau Veritas is one of the "Big Three" global Testing, Inspection, and Certification (TIC) companies, alongside SGS (Switzerland) and Intertek (UK). Founded in 1828 in Antwerp (originally for marine classification), it now provides conformity assessment services across virtually every industry.

**Problem Solved:** Governments and industries need independent third parties to verify that products, assets, and management systems meet regulatory standards and safety requirements. This is not optional -- regulations MANDATE third-party testing in areas like building safety, maritime classification, consumer product safety, food safety, and environmental compliance.

**Revenue Model:** Asset-light services model. Revenue is a mix of:
- **Regulatory/mandatory testing** (~60% of revenue): Required by law. Non-discretionary.
- **Voluntary testing/certification** (~40%): Companies seeking competitive advantage through quality marks, ESG certifications, cybersecurity validation.
- Revenue type: Mix of project-based (inspection), recurring (certification audits), and long-cycle (marine classification for 25-year vessel lifespans).

### Revenue by Division (2024: EUR 6,241M total)

| Division | Revenue | % Total | Organic Growth 2024 | Q3 2025 Organic | Description |
|----------|---------|---------|---------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Marine & Offshore | ~EUR 780M | ~13% | Double-digit | +16.2% | Ship classification, offshore energy. 25-year contracts per vessel. |
| Industry | ~EUR 1,250M | ~20% | High single-digit | +6.9% | Oil & gas, power & utilities, mining inspection. |
| Buildings & Infrastructure | ~EUR 1,125M | ~18% | Mid-single-digit | +7.1% | Construction compliance, fire safety, sustainability. |
| Consumer Products Services | ~EUR 800M | ~13% | Mid-single-digit | +3.5% | Product testing (toys, textiles, electronics). |
| Certification | ~EUR 750M | ~12% | +17.7% (Q3 '24) | +5.9% | ISO management system audits, ESG, cybersecurity. |
| Agri-Food & Commodities | ~EUR 750M | ~12% | Low single-digit | +2.5% | Food testing (divested), commodity inspection. |
| Other/Corporate | ~EUR 786M | ~12% | -- | -- | Includes acquisitions and misc |

### Geographic Diversification (2024)

| Region | % Revenue | Organic Growth |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Europe | 35% | +5.6% |
| Americas | 27% | +12.5% |
| Asia-Pacific | 28% | +9.2% |
| Africa & Middle East | 10% | +23.9% |

Excellent diversification. No single region dominates. Americas and APAC growing faster than Europe, which is a positive mix shift.

### Unit Economics

- **Customer Acquisition Cost:** Low. Customers come because they MUST comply with regulations. The sales cycle is short for mandatory testing. For voluntary certification, it is longer but still driven by external pressure (supply chain requirements, investor demands).
- **Switching Costs:** MODERATE-to-HIGH. Switching TIC providers requires re-accreditation, re-auditing, relationship rebuilding, and risk to certification continuity. Marine classification is essentially a 25-year lock-in per vessel.
- **LTV/CAC:** Very high for marine/industrial clients (multi-decade relationships). Lower for consumer products (more project-based). Blended LTV/CAC estimated >5x.
- **Revenue Recurrence:** ~65-70% of revenue is recurring or repeat (certification audits are annual, marine classification is multi-year, industrial inspection contracts are long-term).

### Structure of Margins

| Metric | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | H1 2025 | Trend |
|--------|------|------|------|------|---------|-------|
| Gross Margin | 72.0% | 71.3% | 72.0% | 72.1% | -- | Stable |
| Operating Margin | 14.4% | 14.1% | 14.0% | 14.6% | 15.4% | Expanding (+44bps H1 2025) |
| Adjusted Op Margin | -- | -- | -- | 16.0% | 15.4% | LEAP|28 target improving |
| FCF Margin | 13.4% | 12.5% | 11.3% | 13.8% | -- | Volatile, improving |

**Key insight:** Gross margin of 72% is exceptionally high for an "industrial services" company. This is 44pp above the sector median (28%) per quality_scorer.py. It reflects the asset-light, knowledge-based nature of TIC work. Operating margins are mid-teens, typical for TIC companies that need significant staffing (445,000 employees). The gap between GM and OPM is SG&A and labor costs.

**LEAP|28 Strategy** (launched Q1 2024):
1. **Focused Portfolio:** Divesting low-growth segments (Food testing, China construction supervision). Acquiring in high-growth areas (cybersecurity, sustainability, renewables).
2. **Performance-Led Execution:** Margin expansion through operational efficiency. H1 2025 already +44bps.
3. **Evolved People Model:** Investing in training, retention, technology-enabled inspections.

Targets: Mid-to-high single-digit organic growth, adjusted margin improvement, 90%+ cash conversion, active M&A.

### Capital Intensity

- **Capex/Revenue:** ~2-3% (asset-light). Labs and equipment, not factories.
- **Working Capital:** Moderate. Services business with 30-90 day payment terms.
- **Acquisition-driven Growth:** 10 bolt-on acquisitions in 2024 (~EUR 180M revenue added), 8 in 9M 2025 (~EUR 92M). Typical TIC consolidation pattern.
- **Capital Requirements:** LOW. This is a people business. Scale comes from hiring, training, and accreditations, not from building plants.

## Why Is It Cheap? (Price EUR 27.20 vs 52wH EUR 31.30)

### Market Narrative

BVI.PA is NOT deeply cheap -- it is 13% below 52-week highs. The stock has been range-bound EUR 24-31 for the past year. The market views it as:
1. **"Good but boring"** -- Mid-single-digit growth, not exciting vs tech/AI.
2. **Wendel overhang** -- Major shareholder Wendel has been systematically reducing its stake (from ~36% to ~21% over 2024-2025), creating share supply pressure.
3. **FX headwinds** -- EUR appreciation vs USD, BRL, CNY reduces reported revenue (4.8% FX headwind in Q3 2025).
4. **P/E already mid-teens** -- Not deeply discounted like some SaaSpocalypse victims.

### My Counter-Thesis

| Market Believes | I Believe | Evidence |
|-----------------|-----------|----------|
| "Boring mid-single digit grower" | 2024 organic growth was 10.2%, H1 2025 was 6.7%. LEAP|28 accelerating growth. | Q3 2025 confirms 6.3% organic, outlook reaffirmed. |
| "Wendel selling = negative signal" | Wendel is monetizing a long-held investment, not fleeing quality deterioration. BVI fundamentals improving. | ROIC 19.1% (accelerating from 14.6% in 2021). FCF record EUR 843M in 2024. |
| "FX headwinds depress growth" | FX is not a fundamental issue. Organic growth (which excludes FX) is the right metric. | All guidance given in organic terms. |
| "Nothing special vs peers" | BVI trades at 18.8x P/E vs SGS 27.3x and Intertek 20.0x. Cheapest of the Big Three despite similar quality. | Comparable organic growth, margins, ROIC. |

### Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | SI/NO | Comment |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Industry in secular decline | NO | TIC TAM growing 3.4-6% annually, regulation increasing globally |
| Technological disruption imminent | NO | AI assists but cannot replace physical inspection/testing. Remote monitoring is additive. |
| Management destroying value | NO | LEAP|28 actively divesting low-growth, acquiring high-growth. Margin expanding. |
| Balance sheet deteriorating | NO | ND/EBITDA 1.11x (H1 2025), improving. Interest coverage 9.5x. |
| Massive insider selling | PARTIAL | Wendel reducing from ~36% to ~21%, but this is a PE-style monetization, not insider panic. CEO/management are not selling. |
| Dividend cut recent/probable | NO | Dividend raised 8.4% to EUR 0.90 in 2024. 62% payout is sustainable. |
| Market share loss >2pp 3yr | NO | Stable #2 global position. Active M&A maintaining/growing share. |
| ROIC < WACC last 3 years | NO | ROIC 16-19% vs WACC 7.3%. Spread +11.8pp and widening. |
| FCF negative >2 years | NO | FCF positive 4/4 years. Record EUR 843M in 2024, 114% conversion. |
| Goodwill >50% equity | NO | Goodwill is material from acquisitions but not >50% of equity. |

**Value Trap Score: 0.5/10** (Wendel overhang is minor negative, not a value trap signal.)

### My Informational Advantage

- Longer time horizon than traders bothered by Wendel share sales
- Recognition that TIC is regulatory-driven (non-discretionary demand)
- Regulatory tailwinds (PFAS, ESG, cybersecurity, CSRD in EU) are multi-year trends
- Cheapest of Big Three TIC companies despite comparable quality

## Projections

### Revenue Growth Derivation

**TAM:** Global TIC market ~$240B in 2025, growing 3.4-6% annually (MarketsandMarkets, GMInsights).

**BVI Market Share:** ~3-4% of global TIC market. Stable. Top 3 players hold ~23% combined.

**Pricing Power:** MODERATE. Regulatory testing has some pricing power (certification fees indexed to complexity). Voluntary testing is more competitive. Blended pricing power ~2-3% annually (above inflation in regulated segments).

**Revenue Growth Formula:**
- TAM growth: +4%
- Market share change: +0.5% (bolt-on M&A net of divestitures)
- Pricing: +2%
- **Total Revenue Growth: ~6.5% (organic ~6%, M&A net +0.5%)**

This is consistent with 2024 actual (10.2% organic) and 2025 guidance (mid-to-high single-digit organic). I am below the recent run-rate because:
1. Marine & Offshore growth (+16.2%) will normalize as shipbuilding cycle matures
2. 2024 had exceptional Certification growth (+17.7%) unlikely to repeat
3. Base case should be conservative

### Margin Projections

| Year | Revenue (EUR M) | Organic Growth | Adj. Op Margin | FCF Margin |
|------|----------------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| 2024A | 6,241 | 10.2% | 16.0% | 13.5% |
| 2025E | 6,650 | 6.5% | 16.3% | 13.8% |
| 2026E | 7,082 | 6.5% | 16.5% | 14.0% |
| 2027E | 7,543 | 6.5% | 16.8% | 14.3% |
| 2028E | 8,033 | 6.5% | 17.0% | 14.5% |
| 2029E | 8,555 | 6.5% | 17.0% | 14.5% |

**Margin rationale:** LEAP|28 is explicitly targeting margin expansion. H1 2025 already +44bps. I project 100bps expansion over 5 years (from 16.0% to 17.0%), reflecting mix shift toward higher-margin services (cybersecurity, ESG certification) and operational efficiency. This is conservative vs management's implied ambitions.

### WACC Derivation

| Component | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Risk-Free Rate (Rf) | 2.6% | France 10Y OAT |
| Equity Risk Premium | 5.0% | Standard European ERP |
| Beta | 0.69 | yfinance (quality_scorer.py) |
| Cost of Equity (Ke) | 6.1% | 2.6% + 0.69 * 5.0% |
| Cost of Debt (Kd pre-tax) | 3.9% | Interest expense / total debt (from tool) |
| Tax Rate | 31.7% | Effective (from tool) |
| Kd after-tax | 2.7% | 3.9% * (1 - 31.7%) |
| Equity Weight | 82% | Market cap EUR 12.1B / (12.1B + 1.7B net debt) |
| Debt Weight | 18% | |
| **WACC** | **5.5%** | |

**Note:** The tool reports WACC 7.3%, which uses a higher equity weight calculation. My calculation using market values gives 5.5%. I will use **7.0%** as a compromise to be conservative (beta of 0.69 for a diversified services company is reasonable, but the low WACC demands conservatism).

### Terminal Growth

**2.5%** -- TIC is an essential service growing with GDP + regulation. Below long-term GDP growth (3%) is conservative. Above pure inflation (2%) reflects structural regulatory expansion.

## Valuation

### Method 1: EV/EBIT Normalized (Primary, 60% weight)

This is the most appropriate method for an asset-light business services company with stable margins.

**EBIT Normalization:**

| Year | Adj. Operating Profit (EUR M) |
|------|------------------------------|
| 2022 | 876 |
| 2023 | 930 |
| 2024 | 996 |
| 2025E | 1,084 (16.3% * 6,650) |
| Average 2022-2025E | 972 |
| Forward 2025E | **1,084** |

**Multiple Selection:**

| Peer | EV/EBIT (trailing) | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| SGS (SGSN.SW) | ~22-24x | Premium for #1 position |
| Intertek (ITRK.L) | ~16-18x | Discount for slower growth |
| BVI.PA current | ~14.5x | Cheapest of Big Three |
| Sector average | ~18-20x | |

BVI.PA deserves a multiple in line with or slightly below SGS, reflecting:
- #2 position (slight discount vs #1)
- Faster organic growth than SGS (10.2% vs SGS ~5-6%)
- LEAP|28 margin expansion story
- Wendel overhang discount of ~1-2 turns

**My multiple: 17x forward EBIT** (below SGS 22x, slightly above Intertek 17x, conservative for the growth profile)

**EV = 1,084M * 17 = EUR 18,428M**
**Equity Value = 18,428 - 1,720 (net debt) = EUR 16,708M**
**Shares outstanding: ~443M**
**Fair Value = EUR 37.7 per share**

### Method 2: DCF (Secondary, 40% weight)

From DCF tool output (adjusted to my parameters):

Using growth 6.5%, WACC 9.0% (tool default, conservative), terminal 2.5%:
- Base case FV: EUR 30.12
- The tool uses 5% default growth which understates BVI's actual growth trajectory
- At my 6.5% growth with 9% WACC: interpolating from sensitivity matrix, FV ~EUR 31-32

With my derived WACC of 7.0% and growth 6.5%:
- From sensitivity: between 7.5% WACC / 6.5% growth (EUR 43.4) and 9.0% / 6.5% (EUR 32.3)
- At 7.0% WACC: approximately EUR 38-40
- This is close to Method 1, confirming valuation range

**Using tool output with reasonable adjustments:**
- Bear (3% growth, 10.5% WACC): EUR 23.16
- Base (5% growth, 9% WACC): EUR 30.12
- Bull (7% growth, 7.5% WACC): EUR 39.98

I will use the tool's base at EUR 30 as my conservative DCF anchor.

**DCF Sensitivity Assessment:**
- FV Spread: 87% (HIGH)
- TV as % of EV: 74.5% (HIGH)
- This means DCF is UNRELIABLE as a precise point estimate. Use as a range: EUR 23-40.
- This confirms EV/EBIT as the more reliable primary method.

### Reconciliation

| Method | Fair Value | Weight | Weighted |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| EV/EBIT (17x forward) | EUR 37.70 | 60% | EUR 22.62 |
| DCF (conservative base) | EUR 30.12 | 40% | EUR 12.05 |
| **Weighted Average** | | 100% | **EUR 34.67** |

**Rounded Fair Value: EUR 33** (conservative rounding down to account for Wendel overhang and DCF uncertainty)

Divergence between methods: 25% (EV/EBIT EUR 37.7 vs DCF EUR 30.1). Below 30% threshold. Explained by DCF using more conservative growth assumptions (tool default 5% vs my 6.5%) and higher WACC.

## Scenarios

| | Bear | Base | Bull |
|--|------|------|------|
| **Thesis** | Organic growth slows to 3-4%. Marine cycle peaks. Wendel exit pressures stock. No margin expansion. | LEAP|28 delivers mid-single-digit organic growth. Margins expand 50-100bps. Bolt-on M&A adds 1-2% growth. | Marine supercycle extends. PFAS/ESG/cybersecurity regulation accelerates. Margin expansion to 17.5%+. |
| **Growth** | 3% | 6.5% | 9% |
| **EBIT Multiple** | 14x | 17x | 20x |
| **FV** | EUR 22 | EUR 33 | EUR 44 |
| **Prob** | 25% | 50% | 25% |

**Expected Value = (22 * 0.25) + (33 * 0.50) + (44 * 0.25) = 5.50 + 16.50 + 11.00 = EUR 33.00**

**MoS Calculations:**
- vs Base FV (EUR 33): Current EUR 27.20 = **+21.3% MoS**
- vs Bear FV (EUR 22): Current EUR 27.20 = **-23.6% (overvalued in bear)**
- vs EV: EUR 33.00 = **+21.3% MoS**

### MoS Assessment (Framework v4.0)

Consulting precedents from decisions_log.yaml:
- Tier B typical MoS acceptance: ~20-25%
- Current MoS of 21% at current price is at the LOW END of Tier B precedents
- At entry price EUR 24: MoS = 37.5% -- this is excellent for Tier B
- Precedent: ROP Tier B at 22% MoS was accepted with standing order (but ROP has WIDE moat)
- BVI.PA has NARROW-to-WIDE moat (narrower than ROP, similar to HRB which was 42% MoS but failed)

**Conclusion:** Current price EUR 27.20 offers 21% MoS which is borderline for Tier B. Entry at EUR 24 offers 37.5% MoS which is very attractive. Recommend WATCHLIST with standing order at EUR 24 and consideration of partial entry at EUR 25-26 if other catalysts align.

---

## Moat Assessment

### Moat Width: NARROW-to-WIDE (17-18/25)

| Moat Source | Strength | Evidence |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Regulatory Mandates** | STRONG | ~60% revenue from legally required testing. Governments mandate third-party verification for building safety, marine classification, product safety. Cannot be disintermediated. |
| **Accreditation Barriers** | STRONG | Operating 1,600+ offices/labs in 85+ countries requires thousands of accreditations from national bodies. Takes years to build. |
| **Switching Costs** | MODERATE | Marine classification is essentially a 25-year lock-in per vessel. But consumer products testing is more commoditized with lower switching costs. |
| **Reputation/Trust** | MODERATE | 196-year history (founded 1828). Certification "mark" has brand value. But SGS and Intertek have similar reputational strength. |
| **Scale** | MODERATE | 445,000+ employees globally. Network effects in coverage (client needs testing in 85+ countries -- few competitors can match). |
| **Pricing Power** | MODERATE | Regulatory testing has decent pricing power (2-3% annual increases). Voluntary testing is more competitive. |

**Why not WIDE:** The TIC market is fragmented (Big Three hold only ~23%). There are many regional and specialty competitors. Consumer products testing has lower barriers than marine or industrial. Certification audits face some competition from second-tier players.

**Why not NARROW:** Regulatory mandates create structural demand that is immune to economic cycles. Accreditation barriers are very real. The global network is nearly impossible to replicate.

### ROIC Persistence

ROIC has been above WACC for all 4 years of available data (14.6%, 17.6%, 16.2%, 19.1%). The trajectory is IMPROVING, not mean-reverting. This supports moat durability.

---

## Key Risks

### Risk 1: Wendel Exit Overhang (HIGH impact, MEDIUM probability)
Wendel has reduced from ~36% to ~21% over 2024-2025 through multiple block trades and a forward sale. Each block sale creates temporary share price pressure. The remaining ~21% stake represents ~EUR 2.5B in shares that could be sold over the next 2-3 years.

**Mitigation:** This is a supply/demand issue, not a fundamental issue. BVI has been buying back its own shares (EUR 200M program). Each Wendel sale creates a buying opportunity.

### Risk 2: Marine Cycle Peak (MEDIUM impact, MEDIUM probability)
Marine & Offshore is the fastest-growing division (+16.2% in Q3 2025) driven by a shipbuilding supercycle. This will eventually normalize. Marine represents ~13% of revenue.

**Mitigation:** Marine is also the most defensive TIC segment (25-year vessel lifespan, mandatory classification). Even post-cycle, Core In-service revenue (42% of Marine) remains stable.

### Risk 3: FX Headwinds (MEDIUM impact, HIGH probability)
EUR appreciation reduces reported revenue. Q3 2025 saw -4.8% FX impact. With EUR strengthening vs USD, BRL, CNY, this headwind persists.

**Mitigation:** BVI reports organic growth excluding FX. Fundamentals are unaffected. Natural hedge from diversified revenue base.

### Risk 4: Competitive Pricing Pressure (LOW-MEDIUM impact, MEDIUM probability)
Voluntary testing (~40% of revenue) faces competition from smaller/regional players. Price competition could compress margins in consumer products and certification.

**Mitigation:** LEAP|28 is deliberately shifting mix toward higher-value services (cybersecurity, sustainability, renewables). Consumer products now a smaller portion of revenue.

### Risk 5: AI/Technology Disruption (LOW impact, LOW probability near-term)
Could AI-powered sensors and remote monitoring reduce need for physical inspection?

**Mitigation:** AI is MORE of a tailwind than a headwind for TIC. Remote monitoring creates NEW testing needs (cyber-security of IoT devices). AI assists inspectors but cannot replace physical verification of buildings, ships, and products. BVI is investing in AI-augmented inspection.

### Risk 6: Acquisition Integration Risk (LOW-MEDIUM impact, MEDIUM probability)
8-10 bolt-on acquisitions per year creates integration risk. Overpaying for targets or poor integration could destroy value.

**Mitigation:** BVI has a decades-long track record of bolt-on M&A. These are small acquisitions (EUR 15-30M each) in known markets. Not transformative M&A. Integration risk is manageable.

## Catalizadores

| Catalyst | Timeframe | Probability | Impact |
|----------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| FY 2025 results (Feb 25, 2026) | 12 days | HIGH | If confirms organic growth and margin expansion, re-rates toward EUR 30+ |
| PFAS regulation expansion (US + EU) | 2025-2028 | HIGH | New testing mandates drive volume growth in consumer products and environmental |
| EU CSRD/ESG reporting mandates | 2025-2027 | HIGH | Third-party verification of sustainability reports = new revenue stream |
| Wendel exit completion | 2026-2027 | MEDIUM | Removes overhang, allows shares to re-rate to peer multiples |
| Cybersecurity certification demand | 2025-2030 | MEDIUM | NIS2 directive in EU mandates cybersecurity audits for critical infrastructure |
| Marine decarbonization regulations | 2025-2030 | MEDIUM | IMO 2050 targets drive new testing/certification needs for green ships |

---

## Kill Conditions

1. **ROIC falls below WACC** (currently +11.8pp spread). If ROIC drops to <7%, the quality thesis is broken.
2. **Organic growth turns negative for 2 consecutive quarters** (excluding FX). Would indicate structural demand decline.
3. **Adjusted operating margin contracts 200bps+ from peak without clear one-off reason.** Would indicate competitive pressure destroying pricing power.
4. **Major regulatory scandal** (certification fraud, testing failure leading to deaths/liability). Existential reputational risk for a trust-based business.
5. **Dividend cut.** With 62% payout ratio and record FCF, a cut would signal fundamental deterioration.

---

## Fit with Portfolio

### Macro Fit (from world/current_view.md)
- **France-listed, EUR-denominated:** Favorable. EUR strong vs USD. No FX conversion issue for our EUR portfolio.
- **Defensive business:** TIC is non-discretionary (~60% regulatory). Recession resistance is HIGH.
- **No tariff exposure:** Services company with no physical goods exports. Zero direct tariff risk.
- **Inflation hedge:** Can pass through costs via pricing. Labor-intensive but margins expanding.

### Sector Fit
- Business Services sector already has EDEN.PA (employee benefits). BVI.PA is in a different sub-sector (TIC vs fintech benefits). Low correlation.
- Adds diversification to a portfolio heavy in UK digital platforms and US tech.

### Geographic Fit
- France-listed but globally diversified (35% EU, 27% Americas, 28% APAC, 10% Africa/ME).
- Adding EUR exposure when EUR is strong is advantageous.

---

## Veredicto: WATCHLIST

**Rationale:**
- Quality: QS 73 (Tier B, upper end). ROIC 19% accelerating. FCF record. Margin expanding.
- Valuation: FV EUR 33, current EUR 27.20 = 21% MoS. Acceptable for Tier B but not exceptional.
- Entry: Standing order at EUR 24 (37.5% MoS) would be excellent. Current price is borderline.
- Catalyst: FY 2025 results on Feb 25 will be decisive. Wait for clarity before committing capital.
- Competition for capital: Portfolio has 57% cash and multiple Tier A candidates closer to entry (RSG, ROP, VRSK). BVI.PA at Tier B 73 is lower priority than Tier A options.

**Recommendation:**
1. Standing order: EUR 24 (entry, ~37.5% MoS, sizing 3-4% / EUR 350-400)
2. Review post FY 2025 results (Feb 25, 2026)
3. If results confirm trajectory AND price remains <EUR 26, consider partial entry
4. Monitor Wendel exit progress as potential buying opportunity on each block sale

## Peer Comparison

| Metric | BVI.PA | SGS (SGSN.SW) | Intertek (ITRK.L) | Eurofins (ERF.PA) |
|--------|--------|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Market Cap | EUR 12.1B | CHF 18.2B | GBP 6.8B | EUR 11.5B |
| P/E | 18.8x | 27.3x | 20.0x | 28.8x |
| Yield | 3.3% | 3.5% | 3.6% | N/A |
| Organic Growth (latest) | 6.3% (Q3 2025) | ~5-6% | ~5% | ~6% |
| ROIC | 19.1% | ~15-18% | ~18% | ~10-12% |
| ND/EBITDA | 1.1x | ~1.5x | ~1.5x | ~2.5x |

**BVI.PA is the cheapest of the Big Three at 18.8x P/E, with the fastest organic growth (10.2% in 2024, 6.3% in Q3 2025), the highest ROIC (19.1%), and the lowest leverage (1.1x).** The discount appears to be primarily driven by the Wendel overhang, which is a temporary technical factor, not a fundamental issue.

## META-REFLECTION

### Incertidumbres/Dudas
- **Division-level revenue breakdown for 2024:** I estimated divisional revenue proportions from growth rates and total revenue, but BVI does not report exact EUR figures by division in press releases (only organic growth rates). The proportions are approximate.
- **LEAP|28 margin targets:** Management has not disclosed specific numerical targets for adjusted operating margin under LEAP|28. I projected 100bps expansion over 5 years based on H1 2025 trajectory (+44bps), which may be conservative or optimistic.
- **Wendel's remaining exit timeline:** The pace of Wendel's stake reduction is uncertain. They could sell the remaining ~21% quickly (creating near-term pressure) or slowly (reducing impact).
- **QS tool scored GM at 72% but this is "Consulting Services" gross margin, not TIC-specific.** The sector median used (28%) for Industrials may be too low, overstating the gross margin premium. TIC peers also have 50-70% gross margins. The actual premium vs TIC peers is narrower than +44pp.

### Sugerencias para el Sistema
- **TIC sector view needed:** The business-services.md sector view covers TIC as a sub-sector, but a dedicated TIC sector view would be useful if we add multiple TIC companies (SGS, Intertek).
- **quality_scorer.py sector classification:** BVI.PA is classified as "Industrials / Consulting Services" which uses a 28% gross margin median. For TIC companies, a "Professional Services" or "TIC-specific" sector median of 55-65% would be more appropriate. The current classification inflates the moat score artificially.
- **FY 2025 results date (Feb 25, 2026):** This should be added to state/system.yaml calendar and earnings pipeline if we proceed with standing order.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator
1. Should we add a BVI.PA standing order at EUR 24 now, or wait for FY 2025 results on Feb 25? The results are only 12 days away and could provide better entry clarity.
2. Given the Wendel block sales create periodic pressure, should we set a "Wendel-triggered" alert rather than a fixed entry price?
3. With 57% cash and Tier A candidates closer to entry (RSG, ROP, VRSK), should BVI.PA (Tier B, QS 73) be deprioritized in favor of higher-quality opportunities?

### Anomalias Detectadas
- **ERF.PA yield of 94% in price_checker** is clearly a data error (likely special dividend or stock split in yfinance data). This does not affect BVI.PA analysis but should be noted.
- **DCF terminal value at 74.5% of EV** confirms the DCF is dominated by terminal assumptions and should not be used as a precise point estimate. The EV/EBIT method is far more reliable for this type of business.
- **ROIC trajectory is ACCELERATING** (14.6% -> 17.6% -> 16.2% -> 19.1%), which is unusual for a mature company. This could indicate LEAP|28 is genuinely improving capital efficiency, or it could reflect cyclical tailwinds (marine, construction) that will mean-revert.
