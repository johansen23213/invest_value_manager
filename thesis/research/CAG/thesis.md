# Conagra Brands (CAG) - Investment Thesis v2.0

**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Analyst:** Fundamental Analyst Agent
**Status:** AVOID - High probability value trap
**Tier:** N/A (Does not pass value trap checklist)

---

## 1. Resumen Ejecutivo

Conagra Brands is a $9.1B packaged food company trading at $19.11 (near 52-week low of $15.96), down 37% from its December 2024 highs. The 7.3% dividend yield appears attractive, but this analysis concludes **CAG is a probable value trap** with 5 of 10 value trap factors triggering.

**Why it is cheap:**
1. Q2 FY26 massive $968M goodwill/brand impairment (Birds Eye, Refrigerated & Frozen)
2. Net loss of $664M (EPS -$1.39) vs profit $285M prior year
3. Declining volumes and revenue (-6.8% Q2 FY26)
4. Dividend payout ratio is NEGATIVE (-667%) as company is losing money
5. ROIC (5.3-5.7%) barely exceeds WACC (~5%) - no economic profit
6. High debt ($7.6B net debt) combined with deteriorating fundamentals

**My assessment:** Unlike GIS (which is fairly valued but not a trap), CAG has multiple structural problems that make the "cheap" valuation deceptive. The dividend is covered by FCF for now but the negative earnings trajectory, massive impairments, and weak ROIC suggest value destruction, not creation.

**Fair Value:** DCF shows $22-32 range, but the model relies on earnings recovery that may not materialize.
**Verdict: AVOID.** This appears to be a value trap. The 37% drop has good reasons behind it.

## 2. Business Understanding

### 2.1 Modelo de Negocio

| Aspecto | Descripcion |
|---------|-------------|
| Problema que resuelve | Convenient prepared foods for time-constrained consumers |
| Cliente target | Mass market US consumers (91% of revenue from US), retailers, foodservice |
| Como genera ingresos | Consumibles - repeat purchase via retail (grocery 77%), foodservice (9%), international (14%) |
| % ingresos recurrentes | ~90% - daily/weekly consumption patterns |

**Segments:**
- **Grocery & Snacks** (~$4.3B, 36%): Hunt's, Slim Jim, Orville Redenbacher's, PAM, Swiss Miss
- **Refrigerated & Frozen** (~$4.9B, 42%): Birds Eye, Marie Callender's, Healthy Choice, Banquet
- **International** (~$0.9B, 8%): Limited presence, declining
- **Foodservice** (~$1.0B, 9%): Commercial/restaurant sales, struggling

**Key Concern:** 28% of revenue comes from Walmart - extreme customer concentration.

### 2.2 Unit Economics

| Metrica | Valor | Benchmark | Comentario |
|---------|-------|-----------|------------|
| CAC | Low (retail distribution) | N/A | Trade spend and slotting fees drive placement |
| LTV | Moderate-Low | N/A | Brand loyalty declining, private label taking share |
| LTV/CAC | ~3-5x estimated | >3x bueno | But declining with brand erosion |
| Consumer retention | Declining | N/A | Losing share to private label |

**Critical Observation:** Unlike GIS (Cheerios #1 share stable), CAG's brands are mid-tier and facing private label pressure more acutely.

### 2.3 Estructura de Margenes

| Margen | Actual | 5y Avg | Tendencia | vs Peers |
|--------|--------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Gross | 27.0% | 28.5% | Compressing | BELOW GIS (34%), K (32%) |
| Operating | 11.0-11.5% (adj) | 13.5% | Compressing | BELOW GIS (15-17%) |
| Net | NEGATIVE (FY26) | 6.5% | Collapsing | BELOW peers |
| FCF | 10-11% | 11% | Declining | In-line but deteriorating |

**5-Year Operating Margin Trend:** Down from ~14% to 11% (adj) - structural compression.

**KEY PROBLEM:** CAG has lowest gross margins among major packaged food peers. This indicates weaker pricing power and/or less efficient operations.

### 2.4 Por Que Esta Barata

**Narrativa del mercado:**
1. Declining volumes for 3+ years with no sign of stabilization
2. $968M goodwill impairment signals management acknowledges brands are overvalued
3. ROIC barely covers WACC - no economic value creation
4. Dividend payout exceeds earnings (currently negative EPS)
5. Private label taking share in frozen foods (CAG's core)
6. GLP-1 drugs reducing food consumption
7. Tariff exposure on imported tinplate steel and aluminum (~3% COGS increase)

**Mi contra-tesis (WEAK):**

| Mercado cree | Yo creo | Mi evidencia | Prob equivocado |
|--------------|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Brands are impaired | Impairments validate concerns, not refute them | $968M write-down of Birds Eye, Earth Balance | 70% |
| Volumes will keep declining | No evidence of turnaround | Organic sales -3% Q2 FY26, guidance -1% to +1% | 60% |
| Dividend at risk | Cash flow still covers but barely | FCF conversion 118% FY25, but down 50% in H1 FY26 | 50% |
| ROIC won't improve | Divestitures may help | Chef Boyardee sale helps focus | 50% |

**CRITICAL:** I cannot construct a convincing counter-thesis. The evidence supports the market's negative view.

### 2.5 Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | SI/NO | Comentario |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Industria en declive secular | PARCIAL | Packaged food flat, frozen declining |
| Disrupcion tecnologica inminente | NO | Food is fundamental |
| Management destruyendo valor | **SI** | $968M impairment, ROIC barely >WACC |
| Balance deteriorandose | **SI** | $7.6B net debt, declining FCF, goodwill >50% equity |
| Insider selling masivo | NO | Mixed (some selling, some buying) |
| Dividend cut reciente/probable | **SI PROBABLE** | Payout ratio -667%, EPS negative |
| Perdida market share >2pp/3y | **SI** | Losing to private label, Birds Eye impaired |
| ROIC < WACC ultimos 3 anos | **PARCIAL** | ROIC 5-6% vs WACC ~5% = minimal spread |
| FCF negativo >2 anos | NO | FCF still positive but declining |
| Goodwill >50% equity | **SI** | $12.9B intangibles on $8.1B equity |

**Total SI:** 5 (Management destroying value, Balance deteriorating, Dividend cut probable, Market share loss, Goodwill >50%)
**Total PARCIAL:** 2 (Secular decline, ROIC near WACC)

**Assessment: PROBABLE VALUE TRAP.** With 5+ factors triggering, CAG fails the value trap checklist. Per investment-rules, this means REJECT or require Tier C (35% MoS minimum).

### 2.6 Mi Ventaja Informacional

**NONE.** CAG is covered by 13+ analysts. The market understands these problems:
- Consensus rating: HOLD (1 buy, 12 hold, 1 sell)
- Average price target: $18.58-19.50 (BELOW current price of $19.11)
- Analysts are telling you this is fairly valued to overvalued

**When the market AND analysts both see problems, and price has dropped 37%, it's usually a trap, not an opportunity.**

## 3. Metricas Financieras Clave

| Metrica | Valor | Sector Avg | Comentario |
|---------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| P/E | N/A (negative) | 18-24x | **RED FLAG** - No earnings |
| P/E Forward (adj) | 10-11x | 18x | Based on $1.70-1.85 guidance |
| P/FCF | 8x | 15-20x | Attractive IF FCF sustains |
| EV/EBITDA | ~9x | 11-13x | Cheap IF fundamentals stable |
| EV/EBIT | ~11x | 12-16x | Misleading due to impairments |
| Dividend Yield | 7.3% | 2.5-3.5% | **DANGER SIGNAL** - Likely unsustainable |
| Payout Ratio | -667% (earnings) | 50-60% | **RED FLAG** - Paying from cash, not earnings |
| Payout (FCF) | ~76% | <80% OK | Manageable but declining FCF |
| Debt/Equity | 0.9x | <1.0x | OK |
| Net Debt/EBITDA | ~4x | <3x preferred | **ELEVATED** |
| Interest Coverage | 3.5-4x | >5x required | **WEAK** |
| ROE | Negative | 15-20% | **RED FLAG** |
| ROIC | 5.3-5.7% | 8-12% | **POOR** - Barely covers WACC |
| FCF Yield | 12-13% | 5-7% | Attractive but declining |

## 4. Proyecciones (Projection Framework)

### 4.1 Drivers de Revenue

| Driver | Valor | Fuente |
|--------|-------|--------|
| TAM actual | ~$400B (US packaged food) | Industry data |
| TAM growth | 1-2% nominal | Slow, mature market |
| Market share actual | ~3% total packaged food | Statista |
| Market share proyectado (5y) | 2.5-3% (losing share) | Private label pressure |
| Pricing power | **WEAK** - below inflation pass-through | Lower gross margins than peers |

**Revenue growth derivado:**
- TAM growth: +1.5%
- Market share: -0.5% to -1% (private label erosion)
- Pricing: +1% (partial inflation pass-through)
- Net: +1% to +2% nominal, **0% to -1% real**
- **FY26 guidance: -1% to +1% organic** (confirms weak outlook)

### 4.2 Proyeccion de Margenes

| Ano | Revenue Growth | Op. Margin (adj) | FCF Margin |
|-----|---------------|------------------|------------|
| FY25 (actual) | -2.3% | 13.2% | 11.2% |
| FY26 (guidance) | -1% to +1% | 11.0-11.5% | 9-10% |
| FY27E | 0% to +1% | 11.0% | 9% |
| FY28E | +1% | 11.5% | 9.5% |

**Critical:** Management expects FY26 EPS of $1.70-1.85 (adj), down from $2.30 in FY25 (-24%). This is NOT a recovery trajectory.

### 4.3 WACC Derivado

```
Risk-free: 4.5% (10Y Treasury)
Beta: 0.69 (yfinance)
ERP: 5.0%
Ke = 4.5% + 0.69 * 5.0% = 7.95% ~ 8.0%

Interest Expense: ~$400M / Debt $8B = 5.0% cost of debt
Tax rate: 24%
Kd after-tax = 5.0% * (1-0.24) = 3.8%

Market Cap: $9.1B | Net Debt: $7.6B | EV: ~$16.7B
E/V = 55% | D/V = 45%

WACC = (0.55 * 8.0%) + (0.45 * 3.8%) = 4.4% + 1.7% = 6.1%
```

**Sanity check:** 6.1% WACC seems reasonable for a leveraged staples company. However, ROIC of 5.3-5.7% means CAG is barely creating value - and likely destroying it when accounting for risk.

**Adjusted WACC for uncertainty: 7.5-8.5%** (adding 1-2% for execution risk and structural headwinds)

---

## 5. Valoracion Multi-Metodo

### 5.1 Metodo 1: DCF (Primary for Stable Staple - BUT CAG is NOT stable)

Tool output (default params):
| Scenario | FV/Share | MoS% |
|----------|----------|------|
| Bear | $22.17 | +16% |
| Base | $31.97 | +67% |
| Bull | $45.84 | +140% |

**CRITICAL WARNING:** The DCF tool assumes 5% FCF growth. CAG's FCF is DECLINING (down $426M YoY in H1 FY26). Using historical growth is dangerous here.

**Conservative DCF (0% growth, 8.5% WACC, 1.5% terminal):**
- Estimated Fair Value: $18-22/share
- This aligns with analyst targets ($18.58 avg)

### 5.2 Metodo 2: EV/EBIT Normalizado

**Sector multiple:** Consumer Staples 12-16x EBIT
**CAG adjustments:**
- -2x for high leverage
- -2x for below-average growth
- -1x for weak ROIC
- -1x for impairment history
= 6-10x appropriate for CAG

Adjusted EBIT (using guidance ~$1.3B operating income):
- At 8x: EV $10.4B - $7.6B net debt = $2.8B equity = **$6/share**
- At 10x: EV $13B - $7.6B = $5.4B = **$11/share**
- At 12x: EV $15.6B - $7.6B = $8B = **$17/share**

**EV/EBIT Fair Value: $10-17/share** (BELOW current price!)

### 5.3 Escenarios

| Escenario | Prob | Assumptions | FV (DCF) | FV (EV/EBIT) | Blended |
|-----------|------|-------------|----------|--------------|---------|
| Bear | 35% | Volumes -3%/yr, margins compress, dividend cut | $15 | $8 | $12 |
| Base | 45% | Flat growth, margins stable at 11%, dividend maintained | $22 | $15 | $18 |
| Bull | 20% | Divestitures work, +2% growth, margin recovery | $32 | $20 | $26 |

**Note:** I assign HIGHER probability to Bear (35%) due to value trap signals and LOWER probability to Bull (20%).

### 5.4 Expected Value y Margen de Seguridad

```
Expected Value = ($12 * 35%) + ($18 * 45%) + ($26 * 20%)
               = $4.20 + $8.10 + $5.20 = $17.50

Precio actual = $19.11
MoS vs Expected Value = -8% (OVERVALUED)
MoS vs Bear Case = -37% (significantly overvalued vs bear)
MoS vs Base Case = +6% (slightly undervalued vs base)
```

### 5.5 Reconciliacion de Metodos

| Metodo | Fair Value | Peso | Weighted FV |
|--------|-----------|------|-------------|
| DCF Conservative | $20 | 25% | $5.0 |
| DCF Tool (Base) | $32 | 10% | $3.2 |
| EV/EBIT Conservative | $15 | 40% | $6.0 |
| Analyst Consensus | $18.58 | 25% | $4.6 |
| **Weighted Average** | | 100% | **$18.80** |

**Conclusion:** Fair value ~$18-19/share. Current price $19.11 = FAIRLY VALUED AT BEST. **No margin of safety for a value trap.**

## 6. Moat Assessment

| Aspecto | Evaluacion |
|---------|------------|
| Tipo | **NONE** |
| Fuentes | Minimal - some brand recognition but eroding |
| Evidencia cuantitativa | ROIC 5.3-5.7% vs WACC ~5-6% = NO excess returns |
| Durabilidad estimada | N/A |
| Amenazas principales | Private label, GLP-1, retailer power (28% Walmart concentration) |

**Moat Matrix:**

| Fuente | Presente? | Fortaleza (1-5) | Evidencia | Durabilidad |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Cost Advantage | NO | 1 | Gross margin 27% = WORST in sector | N/A |
| Network Effects | NO | 0 | N/A | N/A |
| Intangibles | WEAK | 2 | Birds Eye impaired, brands losing share | <10 years |
| Switching Costs | NO | 0 | No switching costs in packaged food | N/A |
| Efficient Scale | NO | 1 | Highly competitive market | N/A |

**ROIC vs WACC Test:**
- ROIC ~5.5% vs WACC ~5-6%
- Spread: 0% to +0.5% = **NO MOAT**
- Per moat-framework: "NUNCA clasificar como Wide sin ROIC > WACC 10+ anos"
- CAG fails this test completely

**Conclusion:** CAG has NO economic moat. It generates no excess returns on capital.

## 7. Riesgos

| Riesgo | Prob | Impacto | Mitigante |
|--------|------|---------|-----------|
| Dividend cut | **ALTA (50%)** | Alto | Could be positive if used for deleveraging |
| Continued volume decline | Alta | Alto | Divestitures, innovation |
| Further goodwill impairments | Media-Alta | Alto | Already impaired $968M, more possible |
| Private label acceleration | Alta | Alto | None - structural problem |
| GLP-1 impact on frozen meals | Media | Medio | Healthy Choice positioning |
| Tariff cost increases (~3% COGS) | Alta | Medio | Pricing pass-through (partial) |

**Kill Conditions (would sell immediately):**
1. Dividend cut (likely to happen)
2. Interest coverage falls below 2.5x
3. FCF turns negative for 2 consecutive quarters
4. CEO departure without clear succession
5. Additional large impairments (>$500M)

---

## 8. Catalizadores

| Catalizador | Timeframe | Prob | Impacto |
|-------------|-----------|------|---------|
| CAGNY conference (Feb 17, 2026) | 0-1m | Media | Clarity on strategy, could be positive or negative |
| Volume stabilization | 6-12m | Baja | +20% if achieved |
| Dividend cut + debt paydown | 0-6m | Media | Could be positive long-term, negative short-term |
| Divestiture of more non-core brands | 6-12m | Media | Focus portfolio, but shrinks company |
| GLP-1 impact proves less severe | 1-2y | Media | +10-15% sector re-rating |

**Negative Catalysts (more likely):**
- Q3 FY26 earnings miss (April 2, 2026)
- Additional impairments
- Dividend cut announcement
- Walmart negotiates lower prices (28% revenue exposure)

---

## 9. Conexion Macro

| Factor Macro | Sensibilidad | Status Actual | Impacto |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|---------|
| Tasas de interes | Media-Alta | Estables ~4.5% | High debt = sensitive to rates |
| Recesion | Baja | Baja probabilidad US | Defensive but already struggling |
| Ciclo economico | Baja | Late-cycle | Should favor staples but CAG underperforming |
| Inflacion | Alta | 3% PCE | Can't pass through fully (low pricing power) |
| Tariffs | Alta | 3% COGS impact | Direct margin pressure |

**Fit con World View:** POOR - While macro favors defensives, CAG is underperforming the defensive playbook due to company-specific problems. Compare to GIS which at least has stable fundamentals.

## 10. Decision

| Campo | Valor |
|-------|-------|
| Recomendacion | **AVOID** |
| Tier | N/A (fails value trap checklist) |
| MoS requerido | 35% (if Tier C, but not recommended) |
| MoS actual | -8% vs Expected Value (overvalued) |
| Entry price target | Would need ~$12-14 for 35% MoS (60%+ drop required) |
| Sizing sugerido | 0% - DO NOT BUY |
| Precio target (Base) | $18 |
| Precio target (Bear) | $12 |
| Horizonte | N/A |

**7 Gates Checklist:**

| Gate | Status | Comment |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1. Business Understanding | PASS | Model understood, problems identified |
| 2. Projection Fundamentals | PASS | Growth derived, shows negative trajectory |
| 3. Multi-Method Valuation | PASS | DCF + EV/EBIT converge on fair value ~$18-19 |
| 4. Margin of Safety (Tier C 35%) | **FAIL** | MoS -8%, not cheap enough |
| 5. Macro Context | PASS | But company-specific issues dominate |
| 6. Portfolio Fit | N/A | Not relevant for AVOID |
| 7. Autocritica | PASS | See below |
| **VALUE TRAP CHECK** | **FAIL** | 5+ factors triggered |

**Verdict: AVOID.** CAG fails multiple gates:
- Gate 4: No margin of safety
- Value Trap Checklist: 5 factors triggered

---

## 11. Autocritica

| Aspecto | Respuesta |
|---------|-----------|
| Asunciones no validadas | 1. Dividend cut timing/magnitude 2. FCF trajectory 3. Whether divestitures will improve ROIC |
| Sesgos posibles | 1. Yield attraction bias (7.3% yield is seductive) 2. Contrarian bias (37% drop looks like opportunity) 3. Mean reversion bias (cheap must go up) |
| Que me haria cambiar de opinion | 1. Two consecutive quarters of positive volume growth 2. ROIC rises to >8% 3. Dividend covered by earnings (not just FCF) 4. Price drops to $12-14 (35% MoS) |
| Mi ventaja informacional | **NONE** - 13 analysts cover CAG, consensus is Hold/Sell, avg target below current price |
| Que podria estar mal en mi analisis | I might be too pessimistic. Management claims "Fuel for Growth" savings and divestitures will help. Maybe turnaround is 12-18 months away. But I see no evidence to bet on this. |

**Comparison to GIS:**
| Factor | GIS | CAG | Winner |
|--------|-----|-----|--------|
| Gross Margin | 34% | 27% | GIS |
| Operating Margin | 16% | 11% | GIS |
| ROIC | 7-10% | 5-6% | GIS |
| Debt/Equity | 1.47x | 0.9x | CAG (but GIS coverage better) |
| Market share stability | Holding #1/#2 | Losing share | GIS |
| Dividend safety | 52% payout | -667% payout | GIS |
| P/E | 10x | N/A (negative) | GIS |
| Value trap score | 2.5-3 factors | 5+ factors | GIS |

**GIS is fairly valued but not a trap. CAG is cheap for good reasons - a probable value trap.**

---

## 12. What Would Change My Mind

1. **Price drops to $12-14 (35%+ MoS):** At that level, even a value trap might have limited downside
2. **Volume growth turns positive for 2 quarters:** Would signal turnaround is working
3. **ROIC improves to 7%+:** Would indicate economic value creation
4. **Dividend cut + debt paydown plan:** Would be painful but improve balance sheet
5. **Successful brand divestiture above book value:** Would prove brands have value

Until then: **AVOID**
