# Moat Assessment: BYIT.L (Bytes Technology Group plc)

## Fecha: 2026-02-11

## Clasificacion: NARROW

**This is an INDEPENDENT assessment. It DISCREPATES with the thesis QS moat score of 22/25.**

My independent assessment scores the moat at **14-16/25**, which is consistent with a Narrow moat, not the Wide/near-Wide implied by the thesis's 22/25 score. The core reason: the thesis conflates CUSTOMER STICKINESS (which is real) with ECONOMIC MOAT (which requires the company to control its own pricing/economics). Bytes does not control its own economics -- Microsoft does.

## Fuentes de Moat Identificadas

| Fuente | Presente | Evidencia | Durabilidad | Trayectoria |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Cost advantage | WEAK | GP/GII margin 6.1% (H1 FY26), down from 6.7%. Scale gives slightly better Microsoft incentives but margin is thin and set by vendor. | 5-10 years | Declining -- Microsoft raising thresholds compresses margins |
| Network effects | NO | No network effects in reselling. More customers does not make the product more valuable to other customers. | N/A | N/A |
| Intangible assets | MODERATE | Top-tier Microsoft Solutions Partner designations. G-Cloud/CCS framework qualification. Cybersecurity vendor certifications. | 10-15 years | Stable -- but certifications are renewable, not permanent |
| Switching costs | MODERATE | 98% customer retention (H1 FY26 disclosed). Multi-year EA relationships. But switching a VAR is easier than the thesis implies -- it does not require changing the actual software. | 10-15 years | Stable |
| Efficient scale | WEAK | UK public sector VAR market dominated by Bytes + Softcat (39% combined). But market has 9 VARs above GBP 100M public sector revenue. Not a natural monopoly. | 5-10 years | Slightly strengthening as Microsoft eliminates sub-scale partners |

## Detailed Analysis of Each Moat Source

### 1. COST ADVANTAGE: WEAK (2/5)

**Thesis claim:** "Scale advantages -- larger VARs get better incentives from Microsoft."

**My assessment:** This is real but LIMITED and SHRINKING.

**Evidence:**
- Bytes' GP/GII margin is 6.1% (H1 FY26), down from 6.7% (H1 FY25). This is an extremely thin margin.
- The margin is fundamentally set by Microsoft, not by Bytes. Microsoft controls: the wholesale price, the incentive structure, the commission rates, and the thresholds for each tier.
- Microsoft raised the CSP direct-bill threshold from $300K to $1M TTM revenue. This does eliminate very small resellers, but does NOT give Bytes pricing power -- it simply concentrates a thin-margin business among fewer, larger players.
- The EA commission pool is collapsing: $2.5B globally in 2023, projected to reach $0 by January 2026 as Microsoft takes all large EA renewals direct. This is not a VAR-friendly trend.
- Bytes' cost structure is primarily people (headcount +12% in H1 FY26), which is not a structural cost advantage -- any well-funded competitor can hire salespeople.

**Durability:** 5-10 years. Microsoft's trend is clear: consolidate around fewer, larger partners while capturing more economics directly. The "cost advantage" of scale is only as durable as Microsoft's willingness to continue sharing economics with partners.

### 2. NETWORK EFFECTS: NONE (0/5)

**Thesis claim:** Not explicitly claimed, but "relationship capital" is discussed as a moat source.

**My assessment:** There are zero network effects in software reselling. Adding customer #5,001 does not make the service more valuable to customer #5,000. Each customer relationship is bilateral, not networked. The thesis's "relationship capital" is better categorized under switching costs and intangible assets, not as a distinct moat source.

### 3. INTANGIBLE ASSETS: MODERATE (3/5)

**Thesis claim:** "Top-tier Microsoft partner status" and public sector framework qualifications.

**My assessment:** These are real barriers to entry but NOT impregnable.

**Evidence for:**
- Bytes holds Microsoft Solutions Partner designations in multiple areas. These require investment, expertise, and track record to obtain.
- G-Cloud framework qualification requires: Cyber Essentials certification, financial health checks, security audits, and technical evaluation. The process is "long, arduous, and without guaranteed success."
- CCS Technology Services 4 framework (launched December 2025) approval is another barrier.
- Multiple cybersecurity vendor certifications (Axonius, Barracuda, Checkpoint, Sophos, Varonis, VMWare awards in H1 FY26).

**Evidence against:**
- These certifications are NOT exclusive. There are 9 VARs with >GBP 100M in UK public sector revenue, and 119 tech suppliers on the latest GBP 1B framework.
- Microsoft partner status is NOT permanent. Microsoft restructures its partner program every 2-3 years, as demonstrated by the FY26 changes that hammered Bytes' margins.
- The ValueLicensing case (UK Competition Appeal Tribunal ruled Microsoft can't stop license reselling) could open new competitive dynamics.
- Softcat holds the SAME certifications and partner statuses.

**Durability:** 10-15 years. The certifications create friction for new entrants but do not prevent competition from established peers.

### 4. SWITCHING COSTS: MODERATE (3/5)

**Thesis claim:** "Strong switching costs -- deeply embedded licensing relationships."

**My assessment:** PARTIALLY TRUE, but the thesis OVERSTATES the depth of switching costs.

**The critical distinction: Switching your VAR is NOT the same as switching your software.**

When a company switches from Bytes to Softcat (or another VAR), it does NOT need to:
- Migrate any software
- Re-train users
- Change its Microsoft EA or CSP agreement (can be transferred)
- Lose any data

What it DOES need to do:
- Rebuild procurement relationships with new VAR team
- Re-negotiate service level agreements
- Potentially re-qualify the new VAR under internal procurement policies
- Transfer license management records

This is a moderate inconvenience, not a high switching cost. The 98% customer retention rate (H1 FY26 disclosed) is real and impressive, but it needs context:

**Why 98% retention does NOT equal deep switching costs:**
1. **Inertia, not lock-in.** Customers renew because the service is adequate, not because switching is prohibitively expensive. The annual license renewal cycle makes it easy to just... renew.
2. **Relationship dependency.** The stickiness is largely in personal relationships with account managers, which is a real factor but fragile -- if key salespeople leave, clients can follow.
3. **Procurement process friction.** For public sector, re-qualifying a new supplier under G-Cloud/CCS frameworks takes effort. This is real but not permanent.
4. **Multi-year EA cycles.** 3-year Enterprise Agreements create natural lock-in periods, but at renewal, the customer can switch VARs relatively easily.

**Quantification attempt:**
- Cost to switch VAR: Low financial cost, moderate time cost (3-6 months of procurement process)
- This is NOT comparable to switching your ERP (SAP/Oracle), which costs millions and takes years
- It IS comparable to switching your insurance broker -- annoying but doable

**Durability:** 10-15 years. The switching costs are real but moderate, not deep. They are sufficient to prevent casual switching but would not prevent a determined customer from leaving.

### 5. EFFICIENT SCALE: WEAK (2/5)

**Thesis claim:** "Microsoft incentives favor larger partners" and "CSP thresholds eliminate smaller resellers."

**My assessment:** The UK VAR market is concentrating, but it is NOT a natural monopoly.

**Evidence:**
- 9 VARs have >GBP 100M in UK public sector revenue
- Bytes + Softcat = 39% of public sector VAR market (GBP 1.45B of GBP 3.7B)
- Computacenter is a significant third player (GBP 7B group revenue, GBP 3.2B market cap)
- Microsoft's FY26 threshold changes ($300K to $1M for direct-bill) will eliminate some smaller players, but the mid-tier competitors (CDW, SHI, Insight, BT) remain viable

**Durability:** 5-10 years. The trend toward consolidation is real but the market is NOT approaching duopoly. Multiple credible competitors remain.

## Evidencia Cuantitativa

### ROIC vs WACC

| Metric | BYIT.L | Peer: SCT.L | Peer: CCC.L | Difference vs SCT.L |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| ROIC (latest) | N/A (data gap) | 76.1% | 37.9% | Cannot compare |
| ROE (latest) | 55.9% | 39.9% | 21.1% | +16.0pp |
| WACC | 8.5% | 8.4% | 9.0% | +0.1pp |
| ROE - WACC spread | +47.4pp | +31.5pp | +12.1pp | +15.9pp |

**CRITICAL DATA GAP:** The quality_scorer tool could not calculate ROIC for BYIT.L due to missing financial data. The thesis claims ROIC spread of +4.9pp, but the ROE trajectory tells a different story: 69% (2022), 66% (2023), 60% (2024), 56% (2025) -- clearly DECLINING. This is a significant concern for a "quality compounder" classification.

**NOTE:** Both Bytes and Softcat have extremely high ROE/ROIC because they are asset-light businesses with minimal invested capital (net cash, negligible fixed assets, negative working capital). The high ROE is a function of tiny equity base, not necessarily exceptional profitability. On an absolute operating profit basis, Bytes earns GBP 65M on GBP 2.1B of throughput -- a 3.1% operating margin on GII.

### Margins vs Peers

| Metric | BYIT.L | SCT.L | CCC.L | Sector Median |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|---------------|
| Gross Margin (on reported revenue) | 75.2% | 43.4% | 14.9% | 55.0% |
| Operating Margin (on reported revenue) | 30.6% | 16.0% | 3.4% | -- |
| FCF Margin (on reported revenue) | 29.9% | 11.3% | 5.5% | -- |
| GP/GII Margin (true economic margin) | ~7.6% (FY25) | ~14.6% | ~3.5% | -- |

**IMPORTANT CONTEXT:** Bytes reports revenue of GBP 217M (GP-like metric), not GII of GBP 2.1B. This makes its "gross margin" appear exceptionally high (75%), but this is a reporting artifact. The true economic margin is GP/GII of ~7.6%, which is reasonable but NOT exceptional. Softcat's GP/GII ratio of ~14.6% is actually BETTER than Bytes', suggesting Softcat has STRUCTURALLY better economics.

### Customer Retention

| Metric | BYIT.L | Evidence |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Customer retention (GP from prior year customers) | 98% | H1 FY26 disclosed in interim results |
| Contract duration | 1-3 years | EA cycles are 3 years, CSP can be monthly/annual |

The 98% retention is real and verified from company disclosures. This is strong evidence of moderate switching costs.

### Market Share Trends

| Year | Bytes Public Sector GII | Softcat Public Sector GII | VAR Market Share (combined) |
|------|------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| FY2025 | GBP 1.14B | GBP 1.098B | 39% of GBP 3.7B market |

Public sector VAR share for IT resellers has grown from 17% to 22% of total public sector IT spending. Both Bytes and Softcat are consolidating market from smaller players.

## Amenazas al Moat

| Amenaza | Probabilidad | Impacto | Horizonte |
|---------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Microsoft takes EA renewals direct (HAPPENING NOW) | **HIGH (90%)** | **HIGH** -- EA commission pool dropping to $0 globally by Jan 2026 | 0-1 years |
| Microsoft continues compressing CSP incentives | Media (50%) | Alto -- CSP is the replacement for EA commissions, further compression hits core economics | 2-5 years |
| AI simplifies licensing/procurement (reducing need for VAR expertise) | Media (40%) | Alto -- if the complexity that justifies VARs diminishes, their value-add collapses | 5-10 years |
| UK government builds in-house digital capability | Media (30%) | Medio -- PM targets 1 in 10 civil servants in digital/tech by 2030. But 53% of civil servants cite skills shortage | 5-10 years |
| Softcat gains market share at Bytes' expense | Media (30%) | Medio -- Softcat has structurally better GP/GII margins and higher ROIC | 3-5 years |
| New entrant disrupts via marketplace/platform model | Baja (15%) | Alto -- Microsoft Marketplace is already evolving to handle transactions directly | 5-10 years |

### The Microsoft Dependency Problem (CRITICAL)

This is the single most important factor in this moat assessment and, in my view, the thesis UNDERWEIGHTS it.

**Facts:**
- 68% of Bytes' GII comes from Microsoft products
- 50% of gross profit comes from Microsoft engagement
- Microsoft controls: product pricing, incentive structures, commission rates, partner thresholds, and the decision of which deals to take direct
- Microsoft is ACTIVELY reducing partner economics: EA commissions going to $0 by January 2026

**The thesis frames this as:** "Microsoft restructures partner programs every 2-3 years. Partners always adapt."

**My counter-view:** This is not a cyclical restructuring. This is a STRUCTURAL shift. Microsoft is taking its most profitable customer relationships direct and leaving partners with the smaller, lower-margin accounts. The trend is unidirectional: Microsoft takes more, partners keep less. Each "restructuring" cycle leaves partners with a smaller slice.

**Key evidence the thesis does not adequately address:**
1. EA commission pool: $2.5B (2023) -> $1.67B (2024) -> $583M (2025) -> $0 (2026). This is not cyclical -- it is a ramp to zero.
2. Bytes' GP/GII margin declined from 6.7% to 6.1% in just 6 months (H1 FY26 vs H1 FY25).
3. Bytes' operating profit declined 7% while GII grew 9.1% -- the operating leverage is working in REVERSE.

**The mitigation argument (services growth):** Services grew 40%+ but from a small base. Services GP was GBP 6M in H1 vs total GP of GBP 82.4M -- just 7.3% of GP. It would need to grow dramatically (to 30%+ of GP) to offset continued software margin compression. At current growth rates, this will take 3-5 years.

## Escenarios de Erosion

### 1. Most Probable Erosion Scenario: Death by a Thousand Cuts (60% probability)

Microsoft continues its pattern of every 2-3 years:
- Raise partner thresholds
- Reduce incentive percentages
- Take larger deals direct
- Push more volume through Marketplace

Bytes adapts each time but with structurally lower margins. GP/GII margin declines from 6.1% to 4-5% over 5 years. Services growth partially offsets but not fully. Operating profit stagnates. The business remains profitable but becomes more commodity-like. Moat erodes from Narrow to None over 10 years.

### 2. Tail Risk: AI-Driven Disintermediation (15% probability, HIGH impact)

AI agents begin autonomously managing software procurement, licensing compliance, and vendor selection. Microsoft's own Copilot tools handle enterprise licensing complexity. The advisory role of VARs becomes unnecessary for routine licensing. Only complex, bespoke projects (security, cloud migration) require human VAR expertise. Bytes' addressable market shrinks by 40-50% over 5-7 years.

### 3. Tail Risk: Microsoft Direct Platform (10% probability, VERY HIGH impact)

Microsoft builds a fully self-service enterprise platform that handles EA/CSP procurement, licensing true-ups, compliance auditing, and basic cloud migration. VARs are fully disintermediated for software licensing. Only value-added services survive. Bytes' software GP (70% of total) evaporates over 3-5 years.

## Discrepancias con Thesis

### 1. Moat Score: Thesis 22/25 vs My Assessment 14-16/25

The thesis scores moat at 22/25, which is the second-highest subscore and implies near-Wide moat. My independent assessment:

| Source | Thesis Implied | My Score | Reason for Difference |
|--------|---------------|----------|----------------------|
| Cost advantage | Strong (included in "Scale") | 2/5 | Scale gives slightly better terms but margin is controlled by Microsoft |
| Switching costs | "Strong" | 3/5 | 98% retention is real but switching is moderate inconvenience, not lock-in |
| Intangible assets | "Strong" (relationships) | 3/5 | Certifications are real barriers but not exclusive |
| Market position | "#1-2" | 3/5 | Yes, #1-2 in public sector but market has multiple credible competitors |
| Network effects | Not claimed | 0/5 | N/A |
| **Total** | **~22/25** | **11-14/25** | |

Adjusted to 25-point scale: **14-16/25** (rounding up for benefit of doubt on market position and retention strength).

### 2. The Microsoft "Dependency" vs "Moat" Confusion

The thesis treats the Microsoft relationship as a moat source. I argue it is simultaneously a DEPENDENCY and a RISK. The relationship gives Bytes access to a large addressable market, but Microsoft controls the economics. A moat should protect the company from competition AND from its suppliers squeezing its margins. The Microsoft relationship fails the second test.

### 3. Softcat Comparison

The thesis highlights that Bytes trades at 14x P/E vs Softcat at 25x and argues this gap is "excessive punishment." My analysis suggests the gap may be PARTLY justified:

| Metric | BYIT.L | SCT.L | Interpretation |
|--------|--------|-------|---------------|
| GP/GII margin (true economic margin) | ~7.6% | ~14.6% | Softcat has structurally better economics |
| ROIC | N/A (data gap) | 76.1% | Cannot compare, but Softcat's is exceptional |
| ROE trajectory | Declining (69% -> 56%) | Declining (54% -> 40%) | Both declining, Bytes faster |
| Insider ownership | 9.6% | 33.4% | Softcat has 3.5x more insider ownership |
| FCF margin (on revenue) | 29.9% | 11.3% | Bytes better on reported revenue metric |

Softcat appears structurally BETTER positioned with higher GP/GII margins, higher ROIC, and much higher insider ownership. Some valuation gap is warranted. How much is debatable, but 14x vs 25x may reflect more than just "market over-reaction."

---

## Moat Classification: NARROW

**Rationale:**

1. **One moderate moat source (switching costs) with verified 98% retention.** This is the strongest moat element and is confirmed by company disclosures. It is moderate, not strong, because the switching costs are friction-based (procurement process, relationship rebuilding) rather than structural (data lock-in, integration depth).

2. **One moderate moat source (intangible assets) with real but non-exclusive barriers.** G-Cloud qualifications, Microsoft certifications, and multi-vendor partnerships create friction for new entrants but do not exclude established competitors.

3. **One weak moat source (scale/efficient scale) that is strengthening but insufficient alone.** Microsoft's threshold increases eliminate small players, benefiting Bytes, but this is Microsoft's decision, not Bytes'.

4. **The ROIC history is consistent with a narrow moat.** ROE consistently above WACC for 4+ years (56-69% vs 8.5%). However, the DECLINING trajectory (69% -> 56% over 4 years) is a warning sign -- consistent with moat erosion, not strengthening.

5. **The critical dependency on Microsoft's economics** prevents upgrading to Wide moat. A Wide moat company should have pricing power and control over its own economics. Bytes has neither -- Microsoft decides what Bytes earns.

**Why not Wide:**
- Only 1 strong/moderate source (switching costs), not 2+ for Wide
- ROIC declining, not stable or increasing
- Company does not control its own economics (Microsoft dependency)
- The structural trend of Microsoft taking more economics direct is unidirectional

**Why not None:**
- 98% verified customer retention is real
- G-Cloud/CCS framework qualifications are real barriers
- Asset-light model with 30% FCF margin demonstrates operating quality
- Market consolidation toward top 2-3 players creates natural oligopoly dynamics

## Moat Score: 14/25

| Component | Score | Max | Justification |
|-----------|-------|-----|---------------|
| Switching costs | 5 | 8 | 98% retention verified, but moderate depth (can switch in 3-6 months) |
| Intangible assets (certifications/qualifications) | 4 | 8 | Real but non-exclusive. Multiple competitors hold same certs |
| Market position | 3 | 5 | #1-2 in public sector VAR, but fragmented broader market |
| Pricing power | 1 | 5 | Near-zero. Microsoft sets prices and incentive structure |
| Durability | 1 | 4 | 10-15 years for switching costs, but declining trajectory on margins |
| **Total** | **14** | **25** | **Narrow moat** |

**vs Thesis score of 22/25:** The thesis overstates moat by 8 points. The primary disagreement is on:
1. Whether the Microsoft relationship is a moat (+8pp in thesis) vs a dependency/risk (neutral-to-negative in my view)
2. Whether the switching costs are "Strong" (thesis) vs "Moderate" (my view)
3. Whether the scale advantage is meaningful (thesis: yes) vs marginal (my view)

---

## Impact on Quality Score

The thesis assigns QS 81/100 (Tier A), with Moat Evidence at 22/25.

With my independent moat score of 14/25, the adjusted QS would be:

| Category | Thesis | Adjusted | Delta |
|----------|--------|----------|-------|
| Financial Quality | 28/40 | 28/40 | 0 |
| Growth Quality | 21/25 | 21/25 | 0 |
| Moat Evidence | 22/25 | 14/25 | **-8** |
| Capital Allocation | 10/10 | 10/10 | 0 |
| **TOTAL** | **81/100** | **73/100** | **-8** |

**Adjusted QS: 73 -- Tier B (Quality Value), NOT Tier A.**

This is a material difference. Tier B companies require higher MoS as compensation for higher uncertainty. At current price of ~296p with a base case FV of 455p, the MoS is 35%, which would be adequate for Tier B but the classification should be updated.

## META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres

1. **ROIC data gap for BYIT.L.** The quality_scorer tool could not calculate ROIC due to missing financials on yfinance. I used ROE as a proxy (55.9%), which suggests returns well above WACC. However, ROE can be distorted by financial leverage (minimal here due to net cash) and by negative working capital / tiny equity base. The true economic return on the business, measured as operating profit on throughput (GII), is ~3.1% -- which is mediocre by any standard. The question is which metric matters more: ROE on equity (high due to tiny equity) or operating margin on throughput (low due to pass-through model).

2. **Bytes vs Softcat GP/GII difference.** I found Softcat's GP/GII margin appears significantly higher (~14.6% vs Bytes' ~7.6%), but this may be partly due to different revenue recognition or product mix (Softcat sells more hardware). I could not fully reconcile this difference from public sources.

3. **98% retention: GP retention or customer count retention?** The H1 disclosure says "98% of our GP coming from customers that we also traded with last year." This is GP-weighted retention, which could mask the loss of smaller customers. Net customer retention (count-based) may be lower.

4. **EA commission impact on Bytes specifically.** The $0 by Jan 2026 figure is a GLOBAL LSP number. Bytes operates as a VAR/CSP, not purely as an LSP. The overlap between Bytes' EA business and the "LSP commission pool" is unclear. Some of Bytes' Microsoft revenue may already be CSP-based and less affected. However, the H1 FY26 results clearly show margin compression from EA incentive changes, confirming the impact is real even if not at the extreme of the global LSP figure.

### Discrepancias con Thesis

1. **Moat score: 22/25 (thesis) vs 14/25 (my assessment).** The 8-point gap is material and driven by disagreement on whether the Microsoft relationship is a moat or a dependency, and on the depth of switching costs.

2. **QS classification: Tier A (thesis) vs Tier B (my assessment).** Moving from 81 to 73 on the QS scale crosses the Tier A/B boundary. This matters for sizing, MoS requirements, and the "quality compounder" classification.

3. **Services growth as moat repair.** The thesis is optimistic that services growth (40%+) will offset software margin compression. While directionally correct, the base is small (7.3% of GP) and it will take years to become material. I give this credit as a future positive but not as a current moat.

### Sugerencias para el Sistema

1. **For any company where >40% of GP comes from a single vendor/partner, the moat assessment should explicitly score "supplier dependency risk" as a NEGATIVE factor.** The current moat framework has no mechanism to penalize vendor dependency.

2. **The distinction between "customer retention" and "switching costs" should be made more explicit in the moat framework.** High retention can result from inertia (low switching motivation) rather than deep switching costs. The framework should test: "If a competitor offered 10% better terms, would customers switch?" If yes, retention is from satisfaction, not lock-in.

3. **GP/GII (or equivalent "true economic margin") should be a mandatory metric for pass-through business models** (VARs, distributors, brokers). Reported gross margins can be highly misleading.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator

1. Does the 8-point moat downgrade (22 to 14) and resulting Tier reclassification (A to B) change the investment thesis? The current 35% MoS would be adequate for Tier B, but the conviction level and sizing may need reconsideration.

2. Should the position be placed on probation given the Microsoft EA commission trend toward zero? The thesis assumes this is cyclical adaptation; my research suggests it is structural deterioration.

3. Given that Softcat has structurally better GP/GII margins, higher ROIC, and higher insider ownership, should the thesis explicitly address why Bytes is preferred over Softcat (beyond the valuation gap)?
