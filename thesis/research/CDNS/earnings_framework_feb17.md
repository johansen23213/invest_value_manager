## Key Metrics to Watch

### 1. FY2026 Revenue Guidance (MOST IMPORTANT)
- **Thesis assumption:** 13-15% revenue growth = $6.0-6.2B
- **Bull:** Guide >$6.2B = AI demand exceeding expectations
- **Base:** Guide $5.9-6.2B = in line
- **Bear:** Guide <$5.8B = AI capex cycle peaking, competitive pressure
- **Kill:** Guide flat/declining = fundamental problem

### 2. Backlog Trajectory
- **Thesis:** Maintain >$7B backlog (was $7.0B end FY2024)
- **Bull:** Backlog >$7.5B
- **Bear:** Backlog <$6.5B (demand deceleration)
- **Context:** Backlog provides 12-18 months revenue visibility

### 3. China Revenue Commentary (CRITICAL given export controls)
- **Thesis:** China ~15-20% of revenue, under pressure
- **Watch for:** Quantified China revenue impact, compliance program updates
- **Red flag:** China >10% decline or new export control restrictions mentioned
- **Positive:** Revenue diversification away from China accelerating

### 4. System Design & Analysis Segment Growth
- **Thesis:** >30% growth (AI-driven chip complexity)
- **This is THE growth driver** — AI chips require more verification/simulation
- **Red flag:** Growth <20% (AI tailwind fading)

### 5. Non-GAAP Operating Margin
- **Thesis:** >44% for FY2026
- **Watch for:** Margin expansion from software mix
- **Red flag:** Margin compression from hardware/IP mix or investment spending

### 6. SBC Growth Rate
- **Thesis:** Decelerating SBC growth is positive
- **Watch for:** SBC as % of revenue trend
- **Red flag:** SBC growing faster than revenue

### 7. Export Control Commentary
- **Thesis:** $140M guilty plea resolved, 3yr probation
- **Watch for:** Any mention of additional investigations, compliance costs, or restricted customer impact
- **Kill flag:** New violations during probation = KC#7 triggered

## Scenarios

| Scenario | Probability | Description | Pipeline Action |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **BULL** | 20% | Beats Q4 + FY2026 guide >$6.2B + backlog >$7.5B + SD&A >35% growth | Proceed to R2; FV may need upward revision; entry still $230-240 |
| **BASE** | 50% | Meets/slightly beats + FY2026 guide $5.9-6.2B + steady backlog | Proceed to R2; maintain FV $260, entry $230-240 |
| **SOFT** | 20% | Slight miss or FY2026 guide <$5.9B + backlog declining + China drag | Pause R2; revise FV to $230-240 range; entry to $200-210 |
| **BEAR** | 8% | Major miss + poor guide + export control escalation | Major FV revision; potentially remove from Tier A |
| **KILL** | 2% | New compliance violations or fundamental demand collapse | KC#7 triggered; remove from universe |

## Decision Framework Post-Earnings

```
IF Bull or Base scenario:
  -> Launch R2 (devil's advocate)
  -> Monitor price for $230-240 entry
  -> Stock at $299 means no action unless major pullback

IF Soft scenario:
  -> Revise FV and entry
  -> If price drops to $230-240 on earnings, evaluate for entry
  -> Proceed to R2 with revised assumptions

IF Bear or Kill scenario:
  -> Pause/remove pipeline
  -> Document lesson learned
```

## Price Action Context

At $299, CDNS is 27% ABOVE our entry target of $235 midpoint. Even a bull earnings would not make this buyable at current prices. The earnings framework is primarily to:
1. Validate or invalidate the R1 thesis
2. Decide whether to advance to R2
3. Update FV/entry if needed for when price eventually approaches entry

## Kill Conditions to Verify

1. ROIC below WACC for 2 consecutive years
2. Gross margin below 80%
3. Revenue declines YoY for 2 consecutive years
4. SBC exceeds 12% of revenue
5. Major customer switches to SNPS
6. Open-source EDA gains >10% market share
7. **Export control compliance recidivism** (NEW — any violation during 3yr probation)
