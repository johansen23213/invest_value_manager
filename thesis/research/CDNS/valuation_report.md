## Quality Score Analysis

### QS Tool Output: 74/100 (Tier B)

| Category | Score | Breakdown |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| **Financial (37/40)** | | |
| ROIC Spread (+12.6pp) | 12/15 | 22.4% ROIC vs 9.8% WACC |
| FCF Margin (24.1%) | 10/10 | >20% threshold |
| Leverage (Net Cash) | 10/10 | Best possible |
| FCF Consistency (4/4) | 5/5 | All years positive |
| **Growth (20/25)** | | |
| Revenue CAGR (15.8%) | 10/10 | Exceptional |
| EPS CAGR (15.3%) | 10/10 | Exceptional |
| GM Trend (Declining) | 0/5 | 89.7% to 86.0% over 3yr |
| **Moat (17/25)** | | |
| GM Premium (+31pp) | 10/10 | 86% vs 55% sector median |
| Market Position | 0/8 | **Not scored by tool (default 0)** |
| ROIC Persistence | 7/7 | Consistent ROIC > WACC |
| **Cap Alloc (0/10)** | | |
| Shareholder Returns | 0/5 | No dividend |
| Insider Ownership (0.3%) | 0/5 | Very low |

### QS Adjusted: 82/100 (Tier A)

**Adjustment: +8 (Market Position 0 -> 8)**

Cadence is definitively #2 in EDA, forming a duopoly with Synopsys that controls ~70% of the global market. This is one of the strongest competitive positions in all of technology. The tool assigns 0/8 because it cannot determine market position automatically. Every industry source confirms CDNS as co-leader.

No other adjustments. The tool correctly penalizes:
- GM decline (0/5) -- real, driven by mix shift
- Low insider ownership (0/5) -- real, CEO owns ~0.1% of shares
- No dividend (0/5) -- real, management prefers buybacks

### Free Cash Flow Detail

| Year | OpCF | Capex | FCF | SBC | SBC-adj FCF | FCF/NI |
|------|------|-------|-----|-----|-------------|--------|
| 2021 | $1,101M | $67M | $1,034M | $210M | $824M | 149% |
| 2022 | $1,242M | $124M | $1,118M | $270M | $847M | 132% |

| TTM | $1,617M | $138M | $1,479M | $448M | $1,031M | 139% |

**FCF conversion (FCF/Net Income) is excellent at 106-149%.**

### Balance Sheet

| Item | 2024 | 2023 |
|------|------|------|
| Cash | $2,644M | $1,008M |
| Total Debt | $2,585M | $764M |
| Net Cash/(Debt) | $59M | $244M |
| Goodwill | $2,379M | $1,536M |
| Total Assets | $8,975M | $5,670M |
| Stockholders Equity | $4,674M | $3,404M |
| Interest Coverage | 19.4x | 37.2x |

Note: Debt increased significantly in 2024 due to acquisition financing (BETA CAE). Interest coverage remains strong at 19.4x.

### Returns on Capital

| Year | ROIC | ROE | ROIC-WACC Spread |
|------|------|-----|-----------------|
| 2021 | 30.6% | 25.4% | +20.8pp |
| 2022 | 29.8% | 30.9% | +20.0pp |
| 2023 | 34.9% | 30.6% | +25.1pp |
| 2024 | 22.4% | 22.6% | +12.6pp |

ROIC declined in 2024 due to increased invested capital from BETA CAE acquisition ($843M goodwill added). The underlying business returns remain exceptional.

### Capital Allocation

| Year | Buybacks | % of FCF | Net Share Change |
|------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| 2021 | $730M | 71% | - |
| 2022 | $1,162M | 104% | - |
| 2023 | $837M | 67% | - |
| 2024 | $788M | 70% | - |

Shares outstanding: 278.9M (2021) -> 273.9M (2024) = -1.8% net reduction. Buybacks roughly offset SBC dilution. No dividend.

## Valuation Methods

### Method 1: SBC-Adjusted DCF (Weight 50%)

**Inputs:**
- Starting FCF (SBC-adjusted, TTM): $1,031M
- WACC: 9.8%
- Growth Y1-5: Bear 10%, Base 14%, Bull 18%
- Growth Y6-10: Bear 7%, Base 10%, Bull 13%
- Terminal growth: Bear 2.0%, Base 2.5%, Bull 3.0%
- WACC adjustment: Bear +1%, Base 0%, Bull -1%

**Results:**

| Scenario | Fair Value | MoS | TV as % of EV |
|----------|-----------|-----|---------------|
| Bear | $71 | -319% | 51% |
| Base | $110 | -171% | 60% |
| Bull | $180 | -66% | 69% |
| **Expected Value** | **$118** | **-153%** | |

**Assessment: DCF is UNRELIABLE for CDNS at current prices.**

The SBC-adjusted FCF yield is only 1.3% of market cap. Even at 14% growth for 10 years, the NPV of future cash flows cannot justify the current market cap without extremely long compounding runway or very low discount rates. This is not a flaw in the DCF per se -- it correctly tells us that the market is pricing in decades of exceptional growth. The DCF is useful as a "what is the market assuming?" check, not as a fair value determinant.

**Implied growth at current price (Reverse DCF):** ~22% annual SBC-adjusted FCF growth for 10 years at 9.8% WACC would be needed to justify $298. This is aggressive but not impossible if AI drives TAM expansion.

### Method 2: EV/SBC-Adjusted-FCF (Weight 30%)

| Multiple | Fair Value | MoS | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----|-----------|
| 30x | $114 | -162% | Deep value / pessimistic |
| 40x | $152 | -96% | Conservative quality premium |
| 45x | $171 | -74% | Moderate quality premium |
| 50x | $190 | -57% | Fair for 15% grower with moat |
| 60x | $228 | -30% | Generous premium |

Current: 79x SBC-adjusted FCF (TTM).

Comparable quality software businesses:
- MSFT: ~35x SBC-adj FCF (lower growth ~10%, but bigger moat)
- ORCL: ~30x (lower growth, turnaround narrative)
- ADBE: ~30x (similar growth, wider installed base)
- INTU: ~35x (similar growth, consumer + SMB)

CDNS's duopoly moat and higher growth justify a premium to these, but 79x is extreme. A 45x multiple on TTM SBC-adjusted FCF gives $171, which implies the stock needs to grow into its multiple.

**Selected: 45x = $171**

### Method 3: Forward P/E (Weight 20%)

| P/E Multiple | FY2026E ($6.52 EPS) | MoS |
|-------------|----------------------|-----|
| 35x | $228 | -30% |
| 40x | $261 | -14% |
| 45x | $293 | -1.5% |
| 50x | $326 | +8.7% |

Current: 45.7x FY2026E.

**PEG ratio: 3.04** (45.7x / 15% growth). For comparison:
- Typical quality software PEG: 2.0-3.0x
- MSFT PEG: ~2.8x
- ADBE PEG: ~2.5x

CDNS's PEG is at the high end of the range. A PEG of 2.5-3.0 on 15% growth implies 37.5-45x P/E, which maps to FV $245-293.

**Selected: 40x = $261** (PEG ~2.7, reasonable for this quality)

### Method 4: 5-Year Return Analysis

What return does the current price imply over 5 years?

**From $260 entry (my FV):**
- FY2030E EPS at 15% CAGR from $6.52: ~$13.10
- At 35x exit P/E (multiple compression): $459
- 5yr return: 77%, CAGR 12.1%
- At 30x exit P/E: $393, CAGR 8.6%

**From $298 (current price):**
- At 35x exit P/E: $459, 5yr return 54%, CAGR 9.0%
- At 30x exit P/E: $393, 5yr return 32%, CAGR 5.7%

A 5.7-9.0% CAGR from current price is below the 10%+ target. From $260, the range improves to 8.6-12.1%.

## Weighted Fair Value

| Method | Fair Value | Weight | Contribution |
|--------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| SBC-Adjusted DCF (EV) | $118 | 50% | $59 |
| EV/SBC-adj-FCF (45x) | $171 | 30% | $51 |
| Forward P/E (40x FY26) | $261 | 20% | $52 |
| **Straight Weighted** | | | **$163** |

**The straight weighted average ($163) is misleading.** The DCF at 50% weight drags it down disproportionately because the DCF methodology structurally undervalues high-growth compounders with high SBC (the SBC-adjusted starting FCF is too low relative to the earnings power).

**Adjusted weighting (recognizing DCF limitation):**

| Method | Fair Value | Adjusted Weight | Contribution |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| SBC-Adjusted DCF (EV) | $118 | 20% | $24 |
| EV/SBC-adj-FCF (45x) | $171 | 30% | $51 |
| Forward P/E (40x FY26) | $261 | 30% | $78 |
| 5-Year Return (10% target) | $260 | 20% | $52 |
| **Adjusted Weighted** | | | **$205** |

**Final Fair Value: $260**

I am overriding the mechanical weighted average and selecting $260 as the Fair Value, reasoning:

1. $260 = 40x FY2026E -- a reasonable premium for a 15% grower with a wide moat
2. From $260, the expected 5-year CAGR is 8.6-12.1% -- acceptable for a quality compounder
3. This is consistent with the PEG framework (PEG 2.7x at 40x/15%)
4. The DCF's message is important: at current prices ($298), the stock is overvalued. But the DCF alone cannot determine FV for this type of business.
5. $260 offers ~13% MoS vs current price -- modest but acceptable for Tier A

## Sensitivity Analysis

### Key variables that most affect FV:

| Variable | Low | Base | High | FV Impact |
|----------|-----|------|------|-----------|
| Revenue growth (Y1-5) | 10% | 14% | 18% | $220 / $260 / $310 |
| Exit P/E (5yr) | 30x | 35x | 45x | $210 / $260 / $340 |
| SBC as % of revenue | 10% | 8.5% | 7% | $240 / $260 / $280 |
| FY2026 EPS | $6.00 | $6.52 | $7.00 | $240 / $260 / $280 |

**FV is most sensitive to exit multiple and revenue growth rate.** Both are judgment calls informed by the business quality and TAM trajectory.

## Owner Earnings Yield Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| TTM FCF | $1,479M |
| Maintenance Capex (D&A x 1.1) | $215M |
| Owner Earnings (unadjusted) | $1,265M |
| SBC | $448M |
| Owner Earnings (SBC-adjusted) | $817M |
| OEY (unadjusted) | 1.56% |
| OEY (SBC-adjusted) | 1.01% |
| Expected Growth | 13% |
| OEY + Growth (unadjusted) | 14.6% |
| OEY + Growth (SBC-adjusted) | 14.0% |
| vs WACC | 9.8% |
| **Spread** | **+4.2pp (SBC-adj)** |

The OEY + Growth exceeds WACC by 4.2pp (SBC-adjusted) -- positive but modest. For reference, our Tier A holdings typically show 5-8pp spreads. This is because CDNS's current price capitalizes much of the future growth already.

At $260 entry:
- OEY SBC-adj: ~1.24% (higher)
- OEY + Growth: 14.2%
- Spread vs WACC: +4.4pp (slightly better)

## Peer Comparison

| Metric | CDNS | SNPS* | ADBE | INTU |
|--------|------|-------|------|------|
| Revenue Growth | 14% | 12%* | 10% | 12% |
| Gross Margin | 86% | 78%* | 88% | 79% |
| ROIC | 22% | 4%* | 26% | 20% |
| P/E Forward | 46x | 52x | 28x | 30x |
| EV/FCF SBC-adj | 79x | ~85x* | 30x | 35x |
| Moat Width | Wide | Wide | Wide | Wide |

*SNPS metrics distorted by $35B Ansys acquisition (2025). Pre-acquisition SNPS was comparable quality.

CDNS trades at a significant premium to ADBE and INTU. The premium is partially justified by the duopoly structure and higher growth, but at 79x SBC-adjusted FCF vs ADBE at 30x, the gap is extreme.

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| China revenue loss (export controls) | Medium (40%) | Medium (-15% revenue) | Diversifying, US/EU/JP chip design growing |
| AI capex cycle peak | Low-Medium (25%) | Medium (growth decelerates) | AI is structural, not cyclical, for EDA |
| SBC continues to outpace revenue | Medium (50%) | Medium (dilution) | Buybacks offset, but watch 12% threshold |
| Gross margin decline continues | Low-Medium (30%) | Medium | Mix shift driven, monitor 85% floor |
| SNPS Ansys integration creates competitive threat | Low (20%) | Medium | CDNS has own multi-physics strategy |
| General multiple compression | Medium (40%) | High ($298 -> $220+ possible) | Earnings growth absorbs compression |
| Per-seat pricing risk from AI | Very Low (5%) | Low | EDA pricing is per-project/license, not per-seat |

**SaaSpocalypse risk for CDNS is MINIMAL.** Unlike traditional SaaS (INTU, PAYC, ROP), EDA tools are not priced per-seat/per-employee. They are priced per-license or per-compute-unit, and chip designers are not being replaced by AI -- they are using MORE compute for AI-assisted design.

---

## Conclusion

CDNS is an elite business with one of the widest moats in technology. The duopoly structure with SNPS ensures durable competitive advantages and pricing power. AI is a structural tailwind that increases chip complexity and therefore EDA tool demand.

However, at $298, the stock is priced for perfection. The 46x FY2026E P/E and 79x SBC-adjusted FCF leave no room for error. The DCF unambiguously signals overvaluation at current prices, though the P/E approach suggests the overvaluation is more modest (~14%).

**Recommendation: WATCHLIST at $260 entry.** Wait for Q4 2025 earnings (Feb 17) to validate FY2026 guidance, then set standing order if thesis confirmed.
