# CDNS - Cadence Design Systems

> **Fair Value:** $260
> **Entry:** $230-240 (revised down from $260 — export control compliance risk margin)
> **Date:** 2026-02-13 (updated Session 69: export control guilty plea integrated)
> **Status:** WATCHLIST - Q4 2025 earnings Feb 17 is hard gate

## TL;DR

Cadence is one of two companies (with Synopsys) that form an impregnable duopoly in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software -- the mission-critical tools required to design every advanced semiconductor chip on the planet. With ~90% gross margins, 22% ROIC, $7B backlog, net cash, and secular AI tailwinds driving chip complexity, this is among the highest-quality businesses in the market. However, at $298 and 46x FY2026 earnings, the stock is significantly overvalued today. Entry at $260 (~40x FY2026E) provides a reasonable starting point for a quality compounder with a 15%+ growth trajectory.

## Quality Score

**QS Tool: 74/100 (Tier B)**

**QS Adjusted: 82/100 (Tier A)**

Adjustment: +8 points. Documented reasoning:

1. **Market Position: +8 points (0 -> 8).** The tool assigns 0/8 for market position because it defaults to 0 when it cannot determine position automatically. CDNS is definitively #2 in EDA (duopoly with SNPS, ~30% market share in a ~70% combined duopoly). This is an undeniable fact supported by every industry source. Market position score: 8/8 (top 2 globally).

No other adjustments warranted. The tool correctly captures:
- ROIC spread of +12.6pp (12/15 points) -- accurate
- FCF margin >20% (10/10) -- accurate
- Net cash position (10/10) -- accurate
- Revenue CAGR 15.8% (10/10) -- accurate
- EPS CAGR 15.3% (10/10) -- accurate
- GM premium +31pp vs sector (10/10) -- accurate
- ROIC persistence 7/7 -- accurate
- GM trend declining (-3.7pp 2021-2024): 0/5 -- THIS IS CONCERNING but accurate
- Insider ownership 0.3% (0/5) -- accurate, low insider ownership
- No dividend (0/5) -- accurate

The GM decline from 89.7% (2021) to 86.0% (2024) is real and needs monitoring, but is driven by revenue mix shift (hardware/IP growing faster than core EDA) rather than competitive degradation. Non-GAAP operating margins are expanding (33% to 38-44%), which is the better measure of profitability trends.

**Adjusted QS: 74 + 8 = 82/100 (Tier A)**

## Business Understanding

### Model de Negocio

**Problem solved:** Designing modern semiconductors is impossibly complex without software tools. A single advanced chip can have billions of transistors. EDA software automates the design, simulation, verification, and manufacturing preparation of these chips. Without CDNS/SNPS tools, no advanced chip gets designed -- period.

**Revenue model (2024: $4.64B):**

| Segment | ~Revenue Share | Growth | Characteristics |
|---------|---------------|--------|-----------------|
| **Core EDA** | ~55% | High single-digit | Subscription/time-based licenses. Most recurring. Design, simulation, verification. |
| **IP Licensing** | ~20% | 25-28% | Semiconductor IP blocks (Tensilica, interface IP). Mix of upfront and royalty. |
| **System Design & Analysis** | ~25% | 35-40% | CFD, structural analysis, electromagnetic simulation (Clarity, Celsius). Fastest growing. |

**Revenue characteristics:**
- ~80-85% recurring (subscription + maintenance)
- Multi-year contracts typical (3-5 year EDA agreements)
- Record backlog: $7.0B (1.3x TTM revenue)
- cRPO (current remaining performance obligations): $3.5B
- Revenue visibility is exceptional -- among the best in all software

**Customers:** Every major semiconductor company (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Qualcomm, Apple, Samsung, TSMC, Broadcom, etc.) plus hyperscalers designing custom chips (Google TPU, Amazon Graviton, Microsoft Maia).

### Unit Economics

- **CAC/LTV:** Essentially infinite LTV. Customer lifetimes span 20+ years. "Customers stop using Cadence when they go out of business, not when they switch vendors."
- **Net retention:** Near 100%+ (customer expansion through more seats, more products, and more IP)
- **GAAP FCF Margin (TTM):** 28.4%
- **SBC-adjusted FCF Margin (TTM):** 19.8%
- **Capital intensity:** Very low. Capex ~2.7% of revenue (2024). Asset-light model.

### Estructura de Margenes

| Metric | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | Trend |
|--------|------|------|------|------|-------|
| Gross Margin | 89.7% | 89.6% | 89.4% | 86.0% | Declining (mix shift) |
| GAAP Op Margin | 26.0% | 30.1% | 30.9% | 29.6% | Expanding then stable |
| Non-GAAP Op Margin | 33.1% | 37.7% | 38.8% | 38.0% | Expanding (FY25E: 43-45%) |
| GAAP FCF Margin | 34.6% | 31.4% | 30.5% | 24.1% | Volatile |
| SBC as % of Revenue | 7.0% | 7.6% | 8.0% | 8.4% | Expanding (concern) |

Gross margin declined from ~90% to 86% due to increased hardware sales (Palladium/Protium emulation/prototyping systems) and IP licensing, which carry lower gross margins than pure EDA software. This is a mix shift, not competitive degradation. Non-GAAP operating margin is the better profitability measure and is clearly expanding from 33% to 44% guided for FY2025.

### Moat Analysis

**Moat rating: WIDE -- among the widest in technology**

| Moat Source | Strength | Evidence |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Switching costs** | Extreme (10/10) | Chip design flows take 2-3 years to qualify. Retraining engineers = massive cost. Companies standardize on one EDA vendor for decades. |
| **Duopoly structure** | Extreme (9/10) | CDNS + SNPS control ~70% of market. Siemens EDA (Mentor Graphics) is distant #3 at ~13%. No new entrant in 30+ years. |
| **IP and know-how** | Very High (9/10) | Decades of accumulated process knowledge. Thousands of patents. Foundry-certified design flows (TSMC, Samsung, Intel). |
| **Network effects** | High (7/10) | Entire ecosystem (PDKs, IP libraries, foundry certifications) built around CDNS/SNPS tools. Self-reinforcing. |
| **Customer captivity** | Extreme (10/10) | Engineers train for years on CDNS tools. Tool proficiency is a career skill. Switching = productivity collapse + time-to-market risk. |

**Key evidence:** CDNS has maintained ROIC > WACC for at least 10 consecutive years, with gross margins persistently above 86%. This is textbook wide moat.

### Por Que Esta Barata (Relative Basis)

**She is NOT traditionally "cheap."** At 46x FY2026E P/E and 79x TTM SBC-adjusted FCF, CDNS trades at a significant premium to the market. The question is whether the premium is justified or excessive.

**Narrative of current discount vs all-time high ($376, Jun 2024):**
- Stock is -21% from ATH due to general semi/tech multiple compression
- China revenue headwinds (~15-20% of revenue historically, under pressure from export controls)
- Market rotation from growth to value in H2 2025
- FY2024 FCF declined vs FY2023 ($1.12B vs $1.25B) due to acquisition spend
- General concern about AI capex sustainability

**My contra-thesis:**
1. China headwind is real but manageable -- CDNS is diversifying revenue geographically, and non-China chip design activity is accelerating
2. FY2024 FCF dip was one-time (acquisition-related). TTM FCF already recovering to $1.48B
3. AI is a STRUCTURAL tailwind, not cyclical -- chip complexity is increasing permanently, requiring more verification cycles
4. $7B backlog provides 1.3x revenue visibility -- these are locked-in multi-year contracts
5. FY2025E guidance of ~14% revenue growth with expanding margins validates thesis

**Value trap checklist: 0/10 factors present**

| Factor | SI/NO | Comment |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Secular decline | NO | TAM growing 9% CAGR |
| Tech disruption | NO | AI strengthens CDNS position |
| Mgmt destroying value | NO | Disciplined capital allocation |
| Balance deteriorating | NO | Net cash |
| Insider selling massive | NO | Low insider ownership but no unusual selling |
| Dividend cut | N/A | No dividend |
| Market share loss | NO | Stable duopoly |
| ROIC < WACC 3yr | NO | ROIC 22-35% vs WACC ~10% |
| FCF negative >2yr | NO | Positive all 4 years |
| Goodwill >50% equity | NO | Goodwill 51% of equity -- borderline but from accretive acquisitions |

### Catalizadores

| Catalizador | Timeframe | Prob | Impact |
|-------------|-----------|------|--------|
| Q4 2025 earnings + FY2026 guidance (Feb 17) | 0-1 week | 70% positive | +/- 10-15% |
| AI chip design complexity acceleration | 1-3 years | High | Structural growth driver |
| System Design & Analysis segment TAM expansion | 1-5 years | High | Revenue mix + growth |
| Broader market correction (creates entry point) | 0-12 months | Medium | Entry opportunity |
| ChipStack AI Super Agent adoption | 1-2 years | Medium | New revenue stream + stickiness |
| CHIPS Act fab construction ramp | 2026-2028 | High | Equipment + design tool demand |

### Kill Conditions

1. **ROIC drops below WACC for 2 consecutive years** (would indicate moat erosion)
2. **Gross margin falls below 80%** (would signal competitive or structural degradation)
3. **Major customer shifts entirely to SNPS** (no evidence of this ever happening)
4. **Open-source EDA tools gain >10% market share** (currently negligible, but monitor)
5. **Revenue declines YoY for 2 consecutive years** (never happened in recent history)
6. **SBC exceeds 12% of revenue** (dilution becoming value-destructive)
7. **AI reduces chip complexity** (extremely unlikely in foreseeable future)

### CRITICAL: Export Control Guilty Plea (Jul 2025)

**This was omitted from the original R1 thesis and added in Session 69.**

In July 2025, Cadence pled guilty to **56 willful violations** of Export Administration Regulations (EAR) for illegally exporting EDA technology to NUDT (National University of Defense Technology) — a PRC military university on the Entity List — between 2015 and 2021.

**Key facts:**
- **$140.6M** combined criminal + civil penalties (DOJ + BIS coordinated)
- **3-year corporate probation** with mandatory annual compliance audits
- Chinese subsidiary knowingly sold $45M+ in EDA technology using aliases and concealed end-users
- Violations were **WILLFUL**, not accidental
- Hagens Berman (securities law firm) investigating potential securities fraud class action
- New export controls on EDA tools to China (May 2025) caused -10.7% stock drop

**Impact on thesis:**
- FV unchanged at $260 — the $140M fine is a one-time sunk cost (<0.2% of market cap), and ongoing business quality is unaffected
- **Entry revised from $260 to $230-240** — additional MoS required to compensate for:
  1. Securities fraud class action tail risk ($50-200M potential)
  2. Stricter China controls permanently reducing addressable market
  3. Compliance probation constraining business flexibility for 3 years
  4. Reputational risk with USG customers (DoD/IC chip designers)
- Added Kill Condition #7 (compliance recidivism)

**See:** thesis/research/CDNS/risk_assessment.md for full risk matrix (Risk #1 and #12).

### Fit Macro

- Mid-cycle US economy with AI capex cycle ongoing -- favorable for CDNS
- Interest rates stable -- modest P/E compression risk but quality compounders recover
- CHIPS Act driving domestic fab buildout -- requires more EDA tools
- US-China tensions create revenue risk for China segment but also create opportunity as domestic chip design accelerates in US/EU/Japan

## Projecciones

### Revenue Growth Derivation

```
TAM Growth: EDA market CAGR 9% (2025-2035, multiple sources)
Market Share: Stable ~30%. No material gain or loss expected.
Pricing Power: Strong -- EDA tool costs are <5% of total chip design cost. Price increases of 3-5% annual pass through easily.
Product Expansion: System Design & Analysis growing 35-40%. IP growing 25-28%. These expand CDNS TAM beyond traditional EDA.

Revenue Growth = TAM (9%) + Pricing (3%) + TAM Expansion (2-4%) = ~14% base case

Historical: 15.8% CAGR (2021-2024). FY2025E guidance: 13.7%.
```

### FCF Growth

Revenue growth plus operating leverage (non-GAAP margins expanding 33% to 44+%) means FCF should grow faster than revenue in the medium term. However, SBC is also growing (7% to 8.4% of revenue), which partially offsets.

SBC-adjusted FCF growth: ~14% (matching revenue growth, with margin expansion offset by SBC growth).

### WACC

| Component | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Risk-free rate | 4.5% | 10Y UST |
| Beta | 1.0 | yfinance (appropriate for low-debt software) |
| Equity Risk Premium | 5.5% | Standard |
| Ke | 10.0% | Rf + Beta x ERP |
| Kd pre-tax | 3.1% | Interest expense / total debt |
| Tax rate | 24.4% | Effective from financials |
| Kd after-tax | 2.3% | |
| E weight | 96.9% | MCap / (MCap + Debt) |
| D weight | 3.1% | |
| **WACC** | **9.8%** | |

## Valoracion

### Method 1: SBC-Adjusted DCF (Weight: 50%)

Starting point: TTM SBC-adjusted FCF = $1,030M

| Scenario | FCF Growth Y1-5 | FCF Growth Y6-10 | Terminal | WACC | FV | MoS |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|----------|------|-----|-----|
| Bear (25%) | 10% | 7% | 2.0% | 10.8% | $71 | -319% |
| Base (50%) | 14% | 10% | 2.5% | 9.8% | $110 | -171% |
| Bull (25%) | 18% | 13% | 3.0% | 8.8% | $180 | -66% |

**DCF Expected Value: $118**

**DCF Sensitivity Assessment:**
- FV Spread: 97-102% (HIGH)
- TV as % of EV: 51-69% (MODERATE to HIGH)
- The DCF is UNRELIABLE as a single point estimate. Use as range context.

**Why the DCF produces very low fair values:** The SBC-adjusted FCF starting point ($1.03B) is modest relative to the $81B market cap. Even at 14% growth for 10 years, the discounted cash flows cannot support the current valuation unless you extend the horizon or use lower discount rates. This is the market saying it believes in a VERY long runway of compounding at high rates.

### Method 2: EV/SBC-Adjusted-FCF Multiple (Weight: 30%)

| Multiple | Fair Value | MoS |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| 25x | $95 | -214% |
| 30x | $114 | -162% |
| 35x | $133 | -124% |
| 40x | $152 | -96% |
| 50x | $190 | -57% |
| 60x | $228 | -30% |

The current market is pricing CDNS at ~79x SBC-adjusted FCF -- extremely elevated.

For context: the highest-quality software businesses (MSFT, ORCL at maturity) trade at 25-35x SBC-adjusted FCF. CDNS commands a premium because it grows faster (15% vs 10%) and has a wider moat (duopoly vs competitive). A 40-50x multiple is defensible for CDNS's quality, but not 79x.

**EV/FCF Fair Value at 45x SBC-adj FCF: $171**

### Method 3: Forward P/E (Weight: 20%)

| P/E Multiple | FY2026E FV ($6.52 EPS) | MoS |
|--------------|------------------------|-----|
| 35x | $228 | -30% |
| 40x | $261 | -14% |
| 45x | $293 | -1.5% |
| 50x | $326 | +8.7% |

Current: 45.7x FY2026E.

For a 15% earnings grower with a wide moat, duopoly structure, and 90% gross margins, a 35-45x forward P/E is reasonable. The market is at the high end but not absurd. The PEG ratio at 3.04 (45.7x / 15% growth) is rich but typical for elite software compounders.

**Forward P/E Fair Value at 40x FY2026E: $261**

### Reconciliation

| Method | Fair Value | Weight | Weighted |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| SBC-Adjusted DCF (EV) | $118 | 50% | $59 |
| EV/SBC-adj-FCF at 45x | $171 | 30% | $51 |
| Forward P/E at 40x FY26 | $261 | 20% | $52 |

**Weighted Average: $163**

**HOWEVER:** The DCF is penalizing CDNS disproportionately because SBC-adjusted FCF is only 1.3% of market cap today. This is a standard problem when valuing high-growth, high-SBC software companies via DCF.

**Alternative valuation framework for quality compounder:**

The better way to think about CDNS is: "What price gives me an acceptable total return over 5 years?"

- FY2030E revenue at 12% CAGR from FY2025: ~$9.5B
- FY2030E non-GAAP EPS at 15% CAGR from FY2026: ~$13.10
- At exit 35x P/E (compressed from current 46x): $459
- At exit 30x P/E: $393
- From $260 entry: 5yr return 51-77%, CAGR 8.6-12.1% (acceptable for quality compounder)
- From $297 entry: 5yr return 32-55%, CAGR 5.7-9.2% (below target)

**Blended Fair Value: $260**

This represents 40x FY2026E earnings, which is:
- A 13% discount to current price ($298)
- Consistent with a 10%+ expected annual return from that entry point
- Reasonable for a duopoly compounder with 15% earnings growth and 90% GM

## Escenarios

| | Bear | Base | Bull |
|--|------|------|------|
| **Thesis** | China revenue loss accelerates, AI capex cycle peaks, margin compression from hardware mix | Steady 13-15% growth, margin expansion continues, AI drives verification demand | AI chip complexity explodes, System Design segment doubles, pricing power increases |
| **FV** | $180 | $260 | $350 |
| **Prob** | 25% | 50% | 25% |

**Expected Value: $180 x 25% + $260 x 50% + $350 x 25% = $263**

**Key driver of FV:** The FV is most sensitive to the exit multiple. Even small changes in the terminal P/E (35x vs 45x) swing FV by $100+. This is characteristic of high-growth, high-multiple stocks.

## SBC Analysis (INTU Precedent)

Per Session 66 INTU precedent, SBC-adjusted FCF is now standard for software companies.

| Year | SBC | % of Revenue | % of FCF |
|------|-----|-------------|----------|
| 2021 | $210M | 7.0% | 20% |
| 2022 | $270M | 7.6% | 24% |
| 2023 | $326M | 8.0% | 26% |
| 2024 | $391M | 8.4% | 35% |
| TTM | $448M | 8.6% | 30% |

**SBC is growing faster than revenue (CAGR ~23% vs revenue CAGR ~16%).** This is a concern. The gap between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is widening. Buybacks ($788M in 2024) roughly offset dilution, but shares outstanding have only decreased from 278.9M (2021) to 273.9M (2024) -- a net reduction of only 1.8% over 3 years.

SBC at 8.6% of revenue is below the software sector average (~12-15%) but trending upward. If it continues to grow faster than revenue, it erodes real shareholder value.

## Upcoming Earnings: Q4 2025 (Feb 17, 2026) -- HARD GATE

**This is a HARD GATE before proceeding to R2/R3/R4.**

**Consensus expectations:**
- Revenue: $1.424B (Q4 2025)
- Non-GAAP EPS: $1.90
- Full-year 2025E revenue: ~$5.28B
- Full-year 2025E non-GAAP EPS: $5.66
- FY2026E guidance: critical -- expect ~$6.0-6.2B revenue (~14% growth)
- FY2026E non-GAAP EPS consensus: $6.52 (+15%)

**What to watch:**
1. FY2026 revenue guidance (>13% = positive)
2. Backlog trajectory (maintain >$7B = positive)
3. China revenue commentary (if declining further, monitor)
4. System Design & Analysis growth (maintain >30%)
5. Non-GAAP operating margin guidance (>44% = positive)
6. SBC growth rate (decelerating = positive)

---

## Kill Conditions

1. ROIC drops below WACC for 2 consecutive years
2. Gross margin falls below 80%
3. Revenue declines YoY for 2 consecutive years
4. SBC exceeds 12% of revenue
5. Major customer (top 10) switches entirely to SNPS
6. Open-source EDA gains >10% market share
7. **Export control compliance recidivism** — any new violation during 3yr probation (2025-2028) or DOJ extending probation. Would signal systemic compliance failure.

---

## Veredicto: WATCHLIST

**Current price ($298) is 14% above Base Case Fair Value ($260).**

CDNS is an exceptional business -- one of the highest quality in the market -- but the price today does not offer sufficient margin of safety. The stock needs to come down to ~$260 to offer an entry point consistent with Tier A precedents (10-15% MoS).

**Entry price: $230-240** (revised from $260 — export control compliance risk margin required)
- At $240: MoS 8% vs Base FV, reasonable for Tier A with compliance tail risk
- At $230: MoS 12% vs Base, attractive entry for quality compounder
- At $220: MoS 15% vs Base, excellent entry

**Recommended action:**
1. Wait for Q4 2025 earnings (Feb 17) -- HARD GATE, validate or adjust FV
2. If stock drops post-earnings to $230-240 range, begin building position
3. Standing order at $235 (midpoint) pending earnings validation
4. Entry above $240 NOT recommended given compliance risk overlay

**This company belongs in the quality universe permanently.** The only question is price.

## 🔄 META-REFLECTION

### Incertidumbres/Dudas
- **Gross margin decline (89.7% to 86.0%):** This is the biggest uncertainty. I attribute it to mix shift (more hardware + IP revenue) rather than competitive erosion, but if it continues below 85%, it signals something worse.
- **SBC growth rate outpacing revenue:** SBC at 8.4% of revenue and growing could erode real returns. If it reaches 12%+, the SBC-adjusted FCF math becomes much less attractive.
- **China revenue risk:** Export controls could permanently reduce CDNS's addressable market by 15-20%. The company is managing this but it's a real headwind.
- **Q4 2025 earnings (Feb 17) could change thesis materially** -- FY2026 guidance is the key variable.
- **DCF produces very low fair values ($71-180)** vs the market price ($298). This is either correct (stock is massively overvalued) or the DCF methodology fails to capture the terminal value of a duopoly compounder. I lean toward the latter but acknowledge this is a judgment call.

### Sugerencias para el Sistema
- **SBC-adjusted valuation should be standard for ALL software companies** -- the INTU precedent is confirmed here. CDNS GAAP FCF of $1.48B vs SBC-adjusted $1.03B is a 30% difference.
- **Consider a "compounder DCF" variant** that extends to 15-20 years for businesses with demonstrably durable moats, rather than the standard 10-year model that relies too heavily on terminal value.
- **quality_scorer.py market_position default of 0** is correct behavior but should be flagged in the output (e.g., "Market Position: 0/8 (NOT SCORED -- requires manual assessment)") to avoid confusing "unknown" with "poor."

### Preguntas para Orchestrator
1. The DCF-based FV ($118) is radically different from the P/E-based FV ($261). This divergence exceeds 30% (it exceeds 100%). Should I flag this as unreliable and lean more heavily on the P/E-based approach for quality compounders?
2. Q4 2025 earnings are on Feb 17 (4 days away). Should we wait before setting a standing order, or set a conditional order now?

### Anomalias Detectadas
- **ROIC declined from 35% (2023) to 22% (2024)** -- likely due to increased invested capital from acquisitions (goodwill up from $1.54B to $2.38B). This is a normal post-acquisition pattern but bears monitoring.
- **FY2024 GAAP FCF ($1.12B) declined vs 2023 ($1.25B)** despite revenue growth. This was acquisition-driven. TTM FCF ($1.48B) shows recovery.
- **Gross margin dropped 3.4pp in one year (2023 to 2024)** -- the largest single-year decline in the dataset. Driven by BETA CAE acquisition and hardware revenue mix. Not yet alarming but trending wrong direction.
