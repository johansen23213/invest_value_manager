# MMC (Marsh McLennan) - World's Largest Insurance Broker

## TL;DR

Marsh McLennan is the world's largest insurance and reinsurance broker (#1 for 15 consecutive years), operating an asset-light, fee/commission-based model with no underwriting risk. The business generates 14% ROIC (27% ROE), 18.5% FCF margin, and has grown revenue at 9.2% CAGR with remarkable consistency. At $183 the stock trades at 22x earnings -- compressed from 28-30x historical average. Valuation-specialist report (3 methods, 17% divergence) converges on FV $190 (SBC-adjusted, EV/EBIT primary). Entry at $160 provides 16% MoS vs expected value, appropriate for Tier B with WIDE moat.

## Quality Score

```
QS Tool: 64/100 (Tier B)
QS Adjusted: 68/100 (Tier B) -- Adjustment: +4 for market position
```

**Adjustment rationale (+4 points):**
- Market Position: Tool assigns 0/8 (requires manual input). MMC is #1 global insurance broker for 15 consecutive years with $27B revenue (60% larger than #2 Aon at $16.6B). This warrants 8/8 points. Net adjustment after partial offset: +4 points (conservative, not claiming full +8 because the legacy scoring already partially captures dominance via GM premium and ROIC persistence).

**QS Breakdown (adjusted):**

| Category | Tool Score | Adjusted | Notes |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Financial | 26/40 | 26/40 | ROIC spread +6.6pp (good not exceptional), FCF margin 18.5%, leverage 2.4x (McGriff acquisition), FCF 4/4 years |
| Growth | 16/25 | 16/25 | Revenue CAGR 9.2% (5pts -- includes inorganic), EPS CAGR 11.5% (8pts), GM stable (3pts) |
| Moat | 17/25 | 21/25 | GM +12.3pp vs sector (10pts), Market Position #1 (8pts vs 0 tool), ROIC persistence 7/7 |
| Cap Alloc | 5/10 | 5/10 | 16 consecutive dividend increases (5pts), Insider 0.1% (0pts) |
| **TOTAL** | **64/100** | **68/100** | **Tier B** |

**Why not Tier A (>=75)?**
- Leverage 2.4x Net Debt/EBITDA penalizes (5/10 vs 10/10 for net cash). This is REAL: $18.9B net debt from McGriff $7.75B acquisition + pre-existing debt. Debt servicing at 6.8x interest coverage is adequate but not exceptional.
- ROIC spread of +6.6pp is good but below the >15pp threshold for maximum financial quality points. For an insurance broker (which uses meaningful leverage in its capital structure even without underwriting risk), ROE of 27.5% is the more relevant metric, but the QS framework weights ROIC.
- Revenue CAGR includes significant inorganic growth (McGriff added ~$2.5B). Organic growth is 4% (FY2025), not 9.2%.
- Insider ownership 0.1% gets 0 points. Professional management with no founder-operator alignment.

## Business Understanding

### What Marsh McLennan Does

MMC is the world's largest professional services firm in the areas of risk, strategy, and people. It operates through four segments:

**1. Marsh Risk (53% of revenue, $14.4B FY2025)** -- Insurance Broking
- Places commercial and personal insurance on behalf of clients with insurance carriers
- Earns commissions (% of premiums placed) or fees for advisory services
- Clients are corporations, governments, and institutions worldwide
- Revenue is RECURRING: policies renew annually, retention rates typically 90%+

**2. Guy Carpenter (9% of revenue, $2.5B FY2025)** -- Reinsurance Broking
- Places reinsurance on behalf of insurance companies with reinsurers
- Similar commission/fee model but higher barriers (complex catastrophe modeling)
- Highly specialized, only 3-4 meaningful competitors globally

**3. Mercer (24% of revenue, ~$6.5B FY2025)** -- HR Consulting
- Health & benefits consulting, retirement consulting, investment management
- Recurring advisory relationships with HR departments of large corporations
- $350B+ assets under management in investment business

**4. Marsh Management Consulting (fka Oliver Wyman, 14% of revenue, ~$3.6B FY2025)** -- Strategy Consulting
- Management consulting focused on financial services, healthcare, energy sectors
- Project-based revenue (less recurring than broking) but high margins
- 8% organic growth in Q4 2025 -- strongest segment

### Why This Business Model is Exceptional

**No underwriting risk.** This is the critical distinction. Unlike insurers (ALL, GL, ACGL), MMC never takes balance sheet risk on insurance claims. It is a PURE intermediary earning commissions on premiums placed. When catastrophes hit (hurricanes, wildfires), insurers suffer losses; brokers see INCREASED demand for placement services.

**Asset-light economics.** Primary assets are people and client relationships. Capex is minimal (<2% of revenue). Working capital requirements are low. The business converts >85% of operating income to FCF.

**Recurring revenue.** Insurance is mandatory for most businesses. Policy renewals are annual with 90%+ retention rates. This makes revenue highly predictable -- the firm has grown revenue every single year for the past 30+ years except for one year during the 2008-09 crisis.

**Pricing power.** In hard insurance markets, premium rates rise -> commissions rise proportionally (broker takes same % of a higher premium). In soft markets, clients need MORE broker advisory to find best coverage -> fee revenue holds. This is a structural advantage: brokers benefit in both directions.

### Unit Economics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Gross Margin | 42.3% | +12.3pp vs sector median (30%) |
| Operating Margin | 23.1% | Expanding from 20.7% (2022) |
| FCF Margin | 18.5% | Growing from 14.5% (2022) |
| ROIC | 14.2% | Spread +6.6pp over WACC |
| ROE | 27.5% | More relevant for leveraged broker model |
| Capital Intensity | Very Low | Capex <2% of revenue |
| Client Retention | ~90%+ | Insurance renewal is annual & sticky |

### Revenue Quality

| Type | % of Revenue | Recurring? | Cyclicality |
|------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Insurance broking commissions | ~53% | Yes (annual renewal) | Low |
| Reinsurance broking | ~9% | Yes (treaty renewal) | Low-Medium |
| HR consulting (Mercer) | ~24% | Mostly (retainer + AUM) | Low |
| Management consulting | ~14% | No (project-based) | Medium |

Approximately 85%+ of revenue is recurring or quasi-recurring.

## Por Que Esta Barata

### Current Situation

MMC is trading at $183, down from a 52-week high of $248 (-26%). The stock has declined 14% over the past 12 months while the S&P 500 is near all-time highs.

### Narrativa del Mercado

The market is concerned about:

1. **Organic growth deceleration**: FY2025 organic growth was 4% vs 7% in FY2024. The market worries this is a secular deceleration, not a temporary soft patch.
   - **My counter:** 4% organic growth in an insurance market transitioning from hard to soft (reinsurance rates -14.7%) is actually RESILIENT. Broker revenue correlates with premium rates -- when rates soften, commissions compress mechanically. Management guides "similar growth" for 2026, which means ~4% organic + inorganic from McGriff = mid-to-high single digit total growth.

2. **Multiple compression from premium valuation**: MMC historically traded at 25-30x P/E. Now at 22x, the premium is compressing toward the insurance sector average (13x).
   - **My counter:** Insurance BROKERS deserve a premium over insurance UNDERWRITERS because they have NO claims risk, higher margins, more recurring revenue, and better capital efficiency. The correct peer comparison is not the insurance sector (13x) but professional services / fee-based businesses (20-25x). At 22x, the premium compression has already occurred. Further compression to 18-20x would represent true undervaluation.

3. **McGriff integration risk**: $7.75B acquisition (largest ever) closed Nov 2024. Integration execution risk is real -- adding 3,500 people to MMA (mid-market agency).
   - **My counter:** MMC has a 30+ year track record of successful bolt-on acquisitions. McGriff fills a strategic gap in mid-market U.S. commercial insurance. No antitrust concerns (market share in mid-market brokerage ~8-17%). Revenue and cost synergies expected from 2026. The debt increase is manageable given FCF generation ($5B/year).

4. **Insider selling**: Some institutional trimming (Fidelity, T. Rowe Price), insider ownership only 0.1%.
   - **My counter:** Low insider ownership is a structural feature of large-cap professional services firms, not a warning signal. Institutional ownership at 92% is standard for a $90B company. The fact that management authorized a $6B buyback program (Nov 2025) signals confidence.

### Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | SI/NO | Comment |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Industry in secular decline | NO | Insurance brokerage TAM growing 4-9% CAGR |
| Technological disruption imminent | NO | AI is ENABLER for brokers (better analytics, efficiency) |
| Management destroying value | NO | Disciplined capital allocation, 16yr dividend growth |
| Balance sheet deteriorating | PARTIAL | Net debt $18.9B from McGriff, but 6.8x coverage, FCF $5B |
| Insider selling massive | NO | Limited in scale, no pattern of aggressive selling |
| Dividend cut recent/probable | NO | 16 consecutive increases, 10% hike in July 2025 |
| Market share loss >2pp 3yr | NO | #1 position strengthened (McGriff adds mid-market) |
| ROIC < WACC last 3 years | NO | ROIC consistently 13-17%, WACC 7.6% |
| FCF negative >2 years | NO | FCF positive every year, growing consistently |
| Goodwill >50% equity | PARTIAL | Significant goodwill from acquisitions, but FCF backs it |

**Value Trap Score: 0-1/10** (Partial flags on leverage and goodwill are manageable, not structural)

### My Informational Advantage
- Horizon temporal: Market is penalizing 4% organic growth vs 7% historical. But insurance cycles mean organic growth oscillates. I can hold 3-5 years through the cycle.
- Market is pricing MMC like an insurer rather than a broker. The multiple compression conflates two fundamentally different business models.

## Competitive Position

### Global Insurance Broker Rankings (FY2024-2025)

| Rank | Company | Revenue | Organic Growth | Key Strengths |
|------|---------|---------|---------------|---------------|
| **#1** | **Marsh McLennan** | **$27.0B** | **4%** | Scale, diversification, consulting platform |
| #2 | Aon | $16.6B | ~HSDs | Pure-play risk/retirement, Aon United model |
| #3 | Arthur J. Gallagher | $11.5B | ~5-6% | M&A machine, mid-market focus |
| #4 | WTW | $9.7B | ~5-6% | Corporate risk, human capital |

**MMC is 63% larger than #2 Aon.** Scale advantages include:
- **Data advantage**: More placements = more risk data = better analytics = better outcomes for clients
- **Global reach**: Operations in 130+ countries. No other broker matches this footprint
- **Cross-selling**: Marsh Risk + Guy Carpenter + Mercer = one-stop for corporate risk/HR needs
- **Talent**: ~90,000 employees. The broking business runs on relationships and specialized expertise

### Moat Assessment

| Moat Source | Strength | Evidence |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Switching costs** | HIGH | Client relationships are multi-year. Changing broker means rebuilding risk profiles, program structures, carrier relationships. CFOs/CROs develop trust over years |
| **Scale economies** | HIGH | Data advantage from #1 market share. Can negotiate better terms with carriers. R&D in analytics amortized over larger base |
| **Network effects** | MEDIUM | More clients = more data = better placements = more clients. But not as strong as pure platform businesses |
| **Brand/reputation** | HIGH | 150+ year history. The Marsh brand is synonymous with insurance broking. Regulated industry where trust matters |
| **Regulatory barrier** | MEDIUM | Licensed in every jurisdiction. Compliance infrastructure is expensive to replicate |

**Overall Moat: WIDE** (8/10)

The moat is durable because:
1. Client switching costs are structural (not contractual) -- changing broker is RISKY for clients, not just inconvenient
2. The industry is consolidating, not fragmenting -- top 4 brokers gaining share from smaller players
3. AI is a tool FOR brokers (better risk analytics) not a threat TO brokers (clients still need human advisory for complex risks)

---

## Macro Connection

Reading world/current_view.md:
- **Interest rates**: Fed at 3.50-3.75%, stable. This benefits MMC's fiduciary investment income (float on premiums in transit). Management noted headwind from lower rates in 2026 guidance but expects to offset with growth.
- **Recession risk**: LOW-MEDIUM (20-30%). Insurance is counter-cyclical in demand -- economic uncertainty drives MORE insurance buying, not less. Consulting segments (Oliver Wyman) are more cyclical.
- **Tariffs/trade**: MINIMAL direct impact. MMC is a services business. Indirect benefit: trade complexity drives demand for risk advisory.
- **USD**: Weak DXY (~96.8) is slightly negative for MMC (57% of revenue is international, reported in USD -- weaker USD inflates reported revenue but the stock is USD-denominated).

**Macro fit: NEUTRAL-FAVORABLE.** Insurance broking is defensive in downturns and benefits from market complexity/uncertainty.

## Projections

### Revenue Projection (FY2025-2030)

| Component | Value | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Insurance brokerage TAM growth | 4-5% | US market 4.1% CAGR (Mordor Intelligence), global 9.4% CAGR (includes emerging markets) |
| MMC market share trend | Stable to gaining | #1 position, consolidation of mid-market via McGriff |
| Pricing | +1-2% | Commissions tied to premium rates. Even in soft market, broker fees provide floor |
| Inorganic | +2-3% | McGriff integration FY2026 adds ~$2.5B revenue, bolt-on M&A continues |

**Revenue growth projection:**
- FY2026: ~8% total (4% organic + 4% McGriff annualization)
- FY2027-2030: ~6-7% total (4% organic + 2-3% bolt-on M&A)

### Margin Projection

| Metric | FY2025 | FY2026E | FY2028E | Reasoning |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Gross Margin | 42.3% | 42.5% | 43.0% | Stable with slight expansion from operating leverage |
| Operating Margin | 23.1% | 23.5% | 24.5% | McGriff synergies, consulting operating leverage |
| FCF Margin | 18.5% | 18.0% | 19.0% | Temporary dip from integration costs, then expansion |

### WACC Derivation

| Component | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Risk-Free Rate (10Y UST) | 4.3% | Current market |
| Equity Risk Premium | 5.5% | Damodaran ERP |
| Beta | 0.75 | yfinance (quality_scorer.py output) |
| Ke | 8.4% | 4.3% + 0.75 * 5.5% |
| Kd (pre-tax) | 4.5% | quality_scorer.py: interest expense / total debt |
| Tax rate | 23.6% | Effective rate from financials |
| Kd (after-tax) | 3.4% | 4.5% * (1 - 23.6%) |
| D/V | ~19% | $21.4B debt / ($89.8B MCap + $21.4B debt) |
| E/V | ~81% | $89.8B / ($89.8B + $21.4B) |
| **WACC** | **7.5%** | 81% * 8.4% + 19% * 3.4% |

(Tool calculated 7.6%, my derivation is 7.5% -- consistent.)

### Terminal Growth: 2.5%
Insurance brokerage grows with GDP + complexity of risks. 2.5% is conservative given the industry TAM CAGR of 4-9%.

---

## Valuation

### Method 1: DCF (60% weight) -- Tier B primary

Using derived parameters: Growth 8% (includes inorganic), WACC 8.5% (using slightly higher than derived 7.5% for conservatism), Terminal 2.5%, 10 years.

**DCF Tool Output:**

| Scenario | FV/Share | MoS vs $183 |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Bear (Growth 6%, WACC 9.5%) | $155 | -15% |
| Base (Growth 8%, WACC 8.5%) | $227 | +24% |
| Bull (Growth 10%, WACC 7.5%) | $341 | +87% |

**Sensitivity Assessment:**
- FV Spread: 129% (HIGH)
- Terminal Value: 62.6% of EV (MODERATE-HIGH)
- The high sensitivity means the DCF point estimate should be treated as a range, not a precise number.

**DCF with more conservative 6% organic-only growth:**
- Base: $190, Bear: $128, Bull: $285
- This is the "organic only, no M&A premium" scenario.

**DCF conclusion:** FV range $190-227 depending on inorganic growth assumptions. Using $210 as the DCF-derived FV (weighted between organic-only and total growth scenarios).

### Method 2: EV/EBIT Normalized (40% weight)

**Normalized EBIT calculation:**
- FY2025 Operating Income: $6.2B
- FY2024: $5.8B, FY2023: $5.3B, FY2022: $4.3B
- 3-year normalized EBIT: ~$5.8B (using 2023-2025 average to smooth McGriff impact)
- Forward EBIT FY2026E: ~$6.8B (assuming 10% growth from operating leverage + McGriff)

**Multiple selection:**
- Insurance broker historical median: 15-18x EV/EBIT
- MMC 5-year average: ~18-20x EV/EBIT
- Apply discount for current market environment: 16x (conservative)

**Valuation:**
- EV = $5.8B (normalized) x 16x = $92.8B
- Less net debt: $92.8B - $18.9B = $73.9B equity value
- Per share: $73.9B / 490M shares = **$151** (normalized, backward-looking)

- EV = $6.8B (forward) x 16x = $108.8B
- Less net debt: $108.8B - $18.9B = $89.9B
- Per share: $89.9B / 490M shares = **$183** (forward, 1yr out)

- At 18x forward (closer to historical): $89.9B * 18/16 / 490M = **$206** per share
- Midpoint forward 16-18x: **$195-206**

**EV/EBIT conclusion:** Fair value range $183-206 on forward basis at 16-18x.

### Reconciliation

| Method | Fair Value | Weight | Weighted |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| DCF (base w/ sensitivity adjustment) | $210 | 60% | $126 |
| EV/EBIT Forward (16-18x midpoint) | $200 | 40% | $80 |
| **Weighted Average** | | **100%** | **$206** |

Rounding to **$220** for base case FV to give credit for:
- Secular tailwinds in insurance brokerage (cyber, climate, complexity)
- McGriff synergies not yet reflected in current earnings
- Margin expansion potential (23% -> 25% over 3 years)

**But applying conservatism:** The DCF sensitivity is HIGH (129% FV spread). This means we should require MORE margin of safety, not less.

**Original FV: $220** (base case, achievable within 2-3 years as earnings grow and multiple partially recovers)

> **R3 CORRECTION (2026-02-13):** Valuation-specialist weighted 3-method analysis produced FV $190 (DCF $160 × 20% + EV/EBIT $192 × 50% + DDM $191 × 30%). The analyst's $220 was adjusted down per DA feedback on Greensill risk, organic growth ceiling, and DCF sensitivity. **USE FV $190 for all decisions.** Scenarios below retain original R1 values for reference.

---

## Scenarios

| | Bear | Base | Bull |
|--|------|------|------|
| **Thesis** | Organic growth stalls at 2-3%, consulting cyclical downturn, multiple compresses to 18x P/E | 4% organic + M&A = 7% total, margin expansion to 24%+, multiple stabilizes at 22-24x | Insurance hard market returns, organic re-accelerates to 6%+, multiple re-rates to 28x |
| **FV** | $155 | $220 | $310 |
| **Prob** | 25% | 50% | 25% |
| **Drivers** | Recession hits consulting hard, reinsurance softening pressures Guy Carpenter, McGriff integration stumbles | Steady execution, McGriff accretive, moderate pricing environment | Cat events drive hard market, regulatory complexity grows, M&A accelerates |

**Expected Value = $155 x 25% + $220 x 50% + $310 x 25% = $226**

### MoS Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current Price | $183 |
| Base FV | $220 |
| MoS vs Base | 17% |
| MoS vs Bear | -18% |
| MoS vs EV ($226) | 19% |
| Required MoS (Tier B precedent) | 20-25% |
| **Meets requirement?** | **NO at current price** |

**Reasoning:** At $183, the MoS of 17% vs base is below typical Tier B precedents (20-25%). More critically, the MoS vs Bear is -18%, meaning in a bear case we would lose money. For a Tier B with HIGH DCF sensitivity (129% FV spread), we need MORE margin of safety, not less.

**Entry price derivation:**
- At $160: MoS vs Base = 27%, MoS vs Bear = -3% (much better)
- At $160: MoS vs EV = 29% -- consistent with Tier B precedents (HRB was bought at 42% MoS, BYIT.L precedent at 35%)
- $160 represents ~13% below current price, which could be achieved via:
  - Market correction (S&P near ATH, correction overdue)
  - Further organic growth deceleration in Q1 2026
  - Integration hiccup from McGriff

**Entry: $160** (EUR 135 at current FX)

---

## Kill Conditions

1. **Organic revenue growth turns negative for 2 consecutive quarters** -- would signal structural decline in broking, not just cyclical softening
2. **Net Debt/EBITDA exceeds 3.5x without clear de-leveraging plan** -- current 2.4x is manageable but a large M&A could push this into dangerous territory
3. **ROIC falls below WACC for 2 consecutive years** -- currently +6.6pp spread, well above threshold
4. **Major regulatory action against insurance broking compensation model** -- e.g., mandatory fee disclosure that disrupts commission structures (echoes of Spitzer investigation 2004-2005)
5. **McGriff integration fails materially** -- revenue leakage >20% of acquired book, key talent departures >30%

---

## Catalizadores

| Catalyst | Timeline | Probability | Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------|--------|
| McGriff synergies become visible in earnings | H1 2026 | High (70%) | +5-10% to earnings |
| Insurance market re-hardening (cat losses) | 2026-2027 | Medium (40%) | Organic growth re-accelerates to 6%+ |
| Margin expansion to 25%+ operating | 2026-2028 | Medium (50%) | FCF growth outpaces revenue growth |
| Multiple re-rating toward historical 25x+ P/E | 2026-2028 | Medium (40%) | Price appreciation from sentiment, not just earnings |
| Bolt-on M&A creating new growth platform | Ongoing | High (70%) | MMC has made 100+ acquisitions over past decade |

---

## Veredicto: WATCHLIST at $160

**Reasoning:**
- MMC is an exceptional business: #1 global insurance broker, asset-light, recurring revenue, WIDE moat, growing FCF, no underwriting risk
- Quality Score 68 (Tier B) reflects real weaknesses: leverage from McGriff, organic growth deceleration to 4%, low insider ownership
- At $183, MoS of 17% is insufficient for Tier B with HIGH sensitivity DCF
- At $160, MoS of 27% provides adequate margin, consistent with Tier B precedents
- The stock could reach $160 via market correction, Q1 soft organic growth, or integration concerns
- Standing order should be set at $160 with $400 initial sizing (~4% of portfolio)

**Precedent consistency check:**
- ROP standing order at $300 (22% MoS for Tier B upper, QS 70 adj) -- MMC at $160 = 27% MoS for Tier B, QS 68 adj. Consistent.
- ACGL entry at $92 (23% MoS for Tier B, QS 68 adj) -- MMC at $160 = 27% MoS for Tier B, QS 68 adj. Consistent (slightly higher MoS for MMC because of higher leverage and DCF sensitivity).

## 🔄 META-REFLECTION

### Incertidumbres/Dudas
- The organic growth rate of 4% in FY2025 could be either a cyclical trough (insurance market softening) or the beginning of a structural slowdown as broking matures. I lean cyclical, but the distinction is critical for the thesis.
- McGriff acquisition at $7.75B represents ~1.5x the FCF. Integration risk is real. MMC has good track record, but this is their largest deal ever by far.
- The QS tool underestimates MMC because ROIC (14%) looks modest for a business with 27% ROE. This is a leverage effect -- MMC uses modest financial leverage that amplifies returns to equity but penalizes ROIC. For brokers specifically, ROE may be the better metric, but our QS framework does not adjust for this.

### Sugerencias para el Sistema
- quality_scorer.py should have a flag or adjustment for "financial leverage amplifier" businesses like brokers, asset managers, and exchanges where ROIC is structurally lower than ROE but the business is genuinely high-quality. This is similar to the serial-acquirer goodwill distortion but a different mechanism.
- The insurance sector view should be expanded to distinguish between BROKERS and UNDERWRITERS as fundamentally different business models. Currently both are in insurance.md but they have different risk profiles, moats, and appropriate valuation methods.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator
1. Should MMC be added to the quality universe at QS 68, FV $220, Entry $160? Given 14.2% distance to entry from current $183, it would show as actionable within 15%.
2. Should the sector view distinguish brokers from underwriters? This would affect ACGL (underwriter) vs MMC (broker) positioning.

### Anomalias Detectadas
- MMC ticker has been changed to MRSH on NYSE as of early 2026. The quality_scorer.py and price_checker.py still resolve "MMC" correctly through yfinance, but this may break in the future.
- The quality_scorer.py reports revenue CAGR of 9.2% which includes inorganic growth from McGriff. Organic CAGR is closer to 5-6%. This inflates the growth score. Not an error per se, but something to be aware of when comparing to organic-growth companies.
