# Systemic Counter-Analysis: Portfolio Assumptions Under Scrutiny

## Date: 2026-02-11
## Type: System Devil's Advocate
## Portfolio: 13 positions, EUR 4,844 cash (44%), EUR ~10,900 total

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis challenges 5 systemic assumptions underpinning the portfolio's strategic direction. After independent research, I find **2 assumptions have MODERATE counter-evidence, 2 have HIGH counter-evidence, and 1 has CRITICAL counter-evidence**. The most dangerous finding: our "probation" mechanism may be a behavioral artifact (disposition effect) rather than a rigorous process, and our 44% cash level is causing significant opportunity cost in a period where quality stocks have cheapened to attractive levels.

## ASSUMPTION 1: "Europe Is Cheap vs US"

### The Assumption
We hold 8/13 positions in Europe/UK (DTE.DE, ALL excluded = 7 EU/UK). The implicit assumption is that European equities are undervalued relative to US equities and will mean-revert.

### The Counter-Argument

Europe may be cheap for **structural reasons that will not reverse**:

**1. Productivity Gap Is Widening, Not Closing**
- EU hourly labour productivity growth has averaged 1.0% annually over 25 years vs 1.7% in the US (ECB data)
- R&D spending by European tech firms: 3-4% of sales vs US firms at 12% of sales (2023)
- European companies face an investment gap of EUR 700B annually vs US counterparts (ECIPE research)
- In 2021, the US had 86% more patent applications in complex technologies vs EU (up from 30% gap in 2000)
- This is not a cycle. It is a structural divergence that has **accelerated** over the past decade.

**2. Demographic Headwinds**
- Europe's working-age population is shrinking. Baby boom generation entering retirement, no replacement cohort
- "Two main symptoms of secular stagnation (demographic slowdown and decline in natural rate of interest) are especially noticeable in Western Europe" (CEPR research)
- Germany's EUR 500B infrastructure fund is positive but provides temporary fiscal impulse, not structural productivity fix

**3. Earnings Growth Is Structurally Lower**
- STOXX 600 consensus EPS declined 1% in 2025 (started the year at +8% estimates)
- Since the GFC, Europe's best-performing stocks were USD-earners or China-exposed -- both tailwinds have reversed
- European corporate profitability chronically lags US: ROE for STOXX 600 ~12% vs S&P 500 ~20%

**4. The "Cheap" Label Has Persisted for a Decade**
- European equities have been "cheap vs US" for 10+ years. This is not a temporary dislocation.
- The market is pricing in lower growth, lower innovation, and higher regulatory burden -- and the market may be **correct**

### Counter-Evidence Quality
Europe actually outperformed the US in early 2025 (DAX, CAC, MIB all beat S&P 500), and Goldman Sachs forecasts continued 5% European gains. Germany's fiscal expansion is a genuine positive structural shift. The valuation gap vs the US has never been wider, suggesting some mean reversion is probable.

### Severity: **MODERATE**

**Impact if we are wrong:** Our EU positions (DTE.DE, EDEN.PA, NVO) are in companies with specific catalysts (DTE.DE: T-Mobile US hidden value, EDEN.PA: rebasing year, NVO: GLP-1 leadership). These are not generic "cheap Europe" plays. The systemic risk is real but our stock selection partially mitigates it.

### Suggested Test
- Track EU vs US relative performance quarterly. If the gap widens another 10%+ over 6 months despite German fiscal stimulus, the structural thesis wins.
- Compare our EU position returns to a simple US QQQ allocation over 12 months. If QQQ outperforms every single EU position, reconsider geographic allocation.

## ASSUMPTION 2: "Quality Compounders Always Outperform Value"

### The Assumption
We migrated the entire system from "buy cheap" (value) to "buy quality" (QS >=75, Tier A). We sold 8 positions to pursue this strategy. Our 7 tools were reoriented from value screening to quality compounding.

### The Counter-Argument

We may be buying quality at **the worst possible time** -- just as the quality factor enters a historically poor regime:

**1. Quality Factor Just Had Its Worst Year in Decades**
- "2025 was the worst year for international quality relative performance since index inception" (Mutual Fund Observer, Feb 2026)
- The MSCI World Quality Index underperformed the broader MSCI World by approximately 11% since mid-June 2024 -- "a deviation that has never been seen in the past 20 years" (Barclays Private Bank)
- Quality stocks went from overvalued (77% cumulative gain 2023-24 from AI enthusiasm) to suddenly cheap

**2. Value Is Outperforming Quality Right Now**
- "Momentum extended its strong outperformance globally, value outperformed and quality lagged" (JP Morgan Factor Views Q4 2025)
- Barclays shifted to neutral on Quality, arguing "reflation trends are likely to favour Value into 2026"
- In European markets specifically, "value has been boosted by gradual policy normalization... lending support to value-heavy segments including banks, industrials and exporters" (JP Morgan)

**3. Historical Precedent: Quality Can Underperform for Extended Periods**
- The Quality Index underperformed for nearly 12 years from 1975 to 1987 (MSCI research)
- Quality tends to underperform during "rising growth" phases -- and we are currently in a rising-growth regime with German fiscal expansion and rate normalization
- "The quality index often experienced underperformance during extreme risk-on periods"

**4. The Paradox of Our Timing**
- We sold 8 value positions to buy quality. But those quality positions are themselves "fallen angels" bought at value prices (LULU -58%, AUTO.L -47%, BYIT.L -47%, NVO -49%, ADBE -51%).
- We are essentially **value investing in quality names**. If quality continues to underperform, our "fallen angels" may keep falling.
- Worse: if the reason they fell is structural (not cyclical), we bought quality traps.

### Counter-Evidence Quality
The quality factor is now trading at -1 standard deviation below its long-term valuation average, meaning it is itself "cheap." Renaissance Investments and T. Rowe Price both note quality is attractively valued for 2026 entry. Historically, quality has outperformed 85% of the time since 1997. Our specific stocks were bought at deep discounts, not at quality premiums.

### Severity: **MODERATE**

**Impact if we are wrong:** Our Tier A positions were bought with 29-38% MoS, providing a buffer against further quality factor compression. However, if the quality premium compresses further AND each stock's specific thesis weakens, we face 20-30% drawdown on positions that represent 40% of the deployed portfolio.

### Suggested Test
- Monitor the MSCI World Quality Index vs MSCI World Value Index monthly. If value outperforms quality for 3 consecutive months from today, flag for review.
- More importantly: track whether our specific positions' fundamentals (ROIC, FCF, growth) are on track vs thesis. If fundamentals hold but price falls, it is a factor rotation problem (tolerable). If fundamentals deteriorate, it is a thesis problem (critical).

## ASSUMPTION 3: "UK Concentration (5/13 Positions) Is Diversification"

### The Assumption
We hold 5 UK positions: MONY.L, AUTO.L, BYIT.L, DOM.L, and GL (US but 5 UK out of 13). These represent approximately 24% of deployed capital. We treat UK as a "developed, stable" geography with high tolerance per Principio 2.

### The Counter-Argument

The UK has **correlated, specific risks** that make this concentration dangerous:

**1. Employer National Insurance Hike -- A Tax on Every UK Business**
- Employer NI increased from 13.8% to 15% in April 2025, with the Secondary Threshold lowered from GBP 9,100 to GBP 5,000
- This is a "double whammy" -- higher rate AND lower threshold
- For a part-time worker on minimum wage, employer NIC nearly **tripled** (GBP 32 to GBP 96/month)
- This directly impacts: MONY.L (employees), AUTO.L (employees + dealer customers), BYIT.L (employees + SME customers), DOM.L (franchisees' labor costs)
- National minimum wage also rising to record levels. Combined effect: higher unemployment, lower consumer spending

**2. Sterling Weakness Risk**
- "Sterling heads into 2026 with plenty of potential headwinds" (Morningstar)
- GDP growth expected to slow to 1.0% in 2026 (from 1.4% in 2025)
- BoE rate cuts expected -- weakens GBP further
- Unemployment could reach 5.5% (11-year high) per some economists
- If GBP/EUR falls 10%, our 5 UK positions lose ~10% in EUR terms regardless of business performance

**3. Political Instability**
- "At least two separate political revolts" hit PM Starmer in 2025
- May 2026 local elections could trigger formal leadership challenge
- Political uncertainty was identified as the "biggest risk for UK markets in 2026"
- A leadership crisis would likely cause sterling selloff and UK equity weakness

**4. Specific Company Correlations**
Our UK positions are more correlated than they appear:
- MONY.L: UK consumer price comparison -- depends on UK consumer spending
- AUTO.L: UK car classifieds -- depends on UK consumer spending + dealer health
- BYIT.L: UK software reseller -- depends on UK corporate IT spending
- DOM.L: UK pizza delivery -- depends on UK consumer spending + labor costs
- All four are UK domestic businesses. A UK recession hits ALL of them simultaneously.

**5. AUTO.L-Specific: Dealer Revolt Is Ongoing**
- 59 dealers cancelled AutoTrader packages, 180+ downgraded subscriptions
- "Years of profiteering prices, above-inflation price hikes" -- dealers' words
- CMA complaints potentially being filed
- Used car supply: 5-6 year old cars to drop 25-30% in 2026 vs 2024
- This is NOT just a "cyclical" issue -- it is a customer relationship problem with a near-monopoly that abuses its market power

### Counter-Evidence Quality
UK equities are themselves deeply undervalued (significant discount to long-run averages and comparable markets). Our UK stocks have specific moats (AUTO.L monopoly, BYIT.L #1 VAR, MONY.L duopoly). GBP weakness is partially priced in.

### Severity: **HIGH**

**Impact if we are wrong:** A UK recession + GBP weakness + NI cost impact could hit all 5 positions simultaneously. If each drops 15-20%, that is a 4-5% portfolio loss from geographic concentration alone. Combined with the fact that 3 of our 5 Tier A positions are UK-based, a UK-specific shock would disproportionately hurt our highest-conviction positions.

### Suggested Test
- Track GBP/EUR weekly. If GBP weakens below 0.82 EUR (currently ~0.84), this is an early warning.
- Monitor UK PMI and unemployment data monthly. If services PMI drops below 48 for 2 consecutive months, UK-specific risk is crystallizing.
- Track AUTO.L dealer count quarterly. If net cancellations exceed 200 (cumulative), the "dealer revolt" thesis is structural.
- Consider: is our next purchase MANDATORY to be non-UK? We should not add a 6th UK position without exceptional justification.

## ASSUMPTION 4: "Probation Is a Rigorous Process"

### The Assumption
4 positions are "on probation": ALL, VICI, UHS, and (until recently) IMB.L. Probation implies structured monitoring with defined exit criteria. It suggests we are being disciplined about low-conviction holdings.

### The Counter-Argument

"Probation" is a behavioral artifact -- the **disposition effect** disguised as process rigor:

**1. The Disposition Effect Is Exactly What We Are Doing**
- The disposition effect is "the tendency to sell winning positions too early and to hold losing positions too long"
- It is driven by "loss aversion and the hope of potential gains, even at the expense of long-term profitability"
- The cost: "between 3.2% and 5.7% for the average investor" (Finnish data study)
- Our probation positions: ALL (P&L approx flat), VICI (slight loss), UHS (significant loss). We ALREADY sold our winners (LIGHT.AS +13.7%, SHEL.L +2.3%, TATE.L +3.5%).
- Classic disposition effect: we sold the gains and are holding the losers.

**2. Probation Has No Defined Timeline or Exit Mechanism**
- ALL: "HOLD ON PROBATION. SELL if Q1 2026 CR >97% or Arity settlement >$1B"
  - But Q1 2026 hasn't happened yet. What if CR is 96%? Still probation? For how long?
  - Arity lawsuits from Texas AG are a **massive** risk: "45 million Americans' driving data" collected illegally
  - The lawsuit includes "Federal Wiretap Act, Stored Communications Act, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act"
  - This is not a minor nuisance. This is a multi-state, multi-statute case with potential for billions in liability
  - Yet our exit criteria says ">$1B" -- effectively saying "we will hold through almost any outcome"

- VICI: "HOLD ON PROBATION through Feb 25 earnings"
  - But what if earnings are "fine"? Does it exit probation? What does "fine" mean?
  - Caesars Regional rent coverage is 1.03x ($750M cash flow vs $730M rent). One bad quarter and coverage goes below 1.0x
  - Wells Fargo downgraded: "flat to negative expected regional gaming growth could eventually force a rent cut"
  - Caesars lease = 25% of VICI's NOI. This is a single-tenant concentration risk masquerading as a "triple-net" safety.

- UHS: "HOLD ON PROBATION through Feb 25 earnings"
  - OBBBA Medicaid cuts are NOW LAW ($1T over 10 years). UHS impact estimated at $360-400M by 2032
  - DOJ $122M settlement + 5-year OIG oversight
  - QS 51 Tier C. MoS ~0%. We are holding a Tier C position with zero margin of safety through structural headwinds
  - This is the textbook definition of "hoping it will recover"

**3. Every Probation Position Was Previously Defended**
- ALL was "post-earnings BEAT - EPS $14.31 vs $9.85 expected" with "combined ratio 72.9"
- VICI was bought as "wide moat REIT, yield 6.3%"
- UHS was bought as "behavioral health leader, P/E 9.6x"
- We had conviction when we bought them. Now we have "probation." This is not discipline; it is **declining conviction without the courage to sell.**

**4. The Capital Cost of Probation**
- These 3 positions represent approximately EUR 1,400 in deployed capital (~13% of total)
- That capital is earning near-zero expected return (MoS ~0% for UHS, MoS ~11% for ALL, MoS ~1% for VICI at current FV)
- Meanwhile we have EUR 4,844 in cash AND 3 probation positions that are essentially dead money
- If we sold all 3 probation positions, we would have ~EUR 6,244 in cash (57%) -- which sounds extreme
- But the counter-question: is 57% cash in a portfolio with proven deployment opportunity (DNLM.L, WKL.AS, MA, V at lower levels) worse than 13% in dead-money positions + 44% in actual cash?

### Counter-Evidence Quality
Probation DOES have defined kill conditions. And some probation positions have upcoming catalysts (VICI Feb 25, UHS Feb 25) that will force a binary decision. ALL's Q4 beat was genuinely exceptional. The process has worked in the past: IMB.L went from probation to SELL.

### Severity: **HIGH**

**Impact if we are wrong:** If probation is indeed inercia, we are forgoing 3-5% annual return drag (disposition effect cost) on ~13% of capital. Over 12 months, that is 0.4-0.7% portfolio-level drag. But the larger risk is opportunity cost: that capital could be in Tier A compounders earning 15%+ forward return.

### Suggested Test
- **The "fresh money" test:** Ask for each probation position: "If I had this cash instead, would I buy this stock today at this price?" If the answer is NO for any position, sell it immediately.
- **The "timeline" test:** Set a HARD deadline for each probation position. Not "through next earnings" (which can be extended indefinitely), but "by March 15, 2026, this position is either UPGRADED or SOLD. No extensions."
- **Track cumulative time on probation.** If any position has been on probation >60 days, the probability of it being upgraded to full conviction is historically near zero.

## ASSUMPTION 5: "44% Cash Is Temporary, We Will Deploy Soon"

### The Assumption
We have EUR 4,844 in cash (44% of portfolio). We treat this as a temporary state that will resolve as we find quality deployment opportunities. Principio 4 says "cash is a position, not a residuo."

### The Counter-Argument

This assumption is **both right and wrong** simultaneously, and both directions are dangerous:

**Direction A: 44% Cash Is Too MUCH -- We Are Bleeding Opportunity Cost**

**1. Professional Allocators Recommend 3-6% Cash**
- Vanguard and Morningstar advise 3-6% cash for diversified long-term portfolios
- Our 44% is 7-15x the recommended level
- "Cash offered both safety and income for a while, but it no longer seems attractive as the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates" (Capital Group)
- "An unprecedented amount of capital still concentrated in cash" is a market-wide problem, not a sign of prudence (Wellington Management)

**2. The Historical Cost of Missing Rallies Is Severe**
- "For dollars parked in cash in lieu of being invested in the S&P 500, 17% was foregone to earn that 5%" (Janus Henderson)
- A 60/40 portfolio earned 26% in 12 months ending Sept 2024 vs cash yields
- Our portfolio has been holding elevated cash since the adversarial review started (Feb 7). In that time, markets have continued trading normally while our capital sits idle.

**3. Quality Stocks Have Already Cheapened**
- Quality factor at -1 standard deviation below long-term valuation average (Renaissance Investments)
- Multiple Tier A stocks in our pipeline at near-entry levels (DNLM.L interims came in, WKL.AS earnings Feb 25)
- Our own Tier A positions were bought at deep discounts -- if we were confident enough to buy them, why not deploy remaining cash into them (ADD triggers)?

**4. Cash Drag Is Compounding**
- EUR 4,844 in cash earns approximately 0% in a brokerage account (eToro does not pay interest on EUR cash)
- The S&P 500 has returned approximately +5% since Jan 26 (when we started investing)
- EUR 4,844 not invested has cost approximately EUR 242 in missed returns -- and this grows each month
- At current trajectory, 44% cash for 6 months costs approximately EUR 500-600 in opportunity cost

**Direction B: 44% Cash Might Actually Be Optimal**

**1. The Macro Context Is Genuinely Uncertain**
- Tariff escalation (60-70% probability), US-China tension, Iran situation
- US valuations near historic highs (S&P 500 Shiller P/E ~35)
- "Elevated valuations, increased market concentration, and mediocre macroeconomic conditions underpin views that equity risks are heightened" (Cambridge Associates)
- A 15-20% correction would let us deploy at much better prices

**2. Our Pipeline Is Not Ready**
- DNLM.L needs to drop to 750-800 GBp (currently ~936 after interims)
- WKL.AS needs post-earnings clarity (Feb 25) and entry at EUR 50-55
- MA needs $395 (-28% from current), V needs $280 (-15%)
- We literally cannot deploy into our best ideas at current prices
- Holding cash IS the rational response when entry prices have not arrived

**3. The Risk of Deploying Into a Correction**
- If we rush to deploy and markets correct 20%, our newly deployed capital drops 20%
- With 44% cash, a 20% correction on 56% deployed = 11.2% portfolio loss
- If we were fully invested, a 20% correction = 20% portfolio loss
- The difference is 8.8 percentage points of protection -- worth approximately EUR 960

### The Real Problem

The honest diagnosis is that 44% cash is not a strategy. It is an **artifact of selling faster than we can buy**. We sold 8 positions in ~10 days but have no mechanism for rapid redeployment because:
1. Our buy process is rigorous (4-round adversarial pipeline) -- which is correct but slow
2. Our target prices are below market for most pipeline stocks -- which is disciplined but means we wait
3. We have no standing orders for Tier A ADDs at current prices -- which is a process gap

### Severity: **CRITICAL**

**Impact if we are wrong (Direction A):** If markets rally 10% and we miss it with 44% of capital, that is 4.4% portfolio drag. Over a full year, the expected cost of 44% cash in a normal market environment (equities return ~8%) is approximately EUR 388 annually.

**Impact if we are wrong (Direction B):** If we rush to deploy and markets correct 20%, we lose approximately EUR 484 on newly deployed capital.

**The asymmetry:** The cost of holding too much cash (slow bleed, 3-4% annual drag) is LOWER than the cost of deploying into a crash (acute 10-20% loss). But the PROBABILITY of a 20% crash in the next 6 months is only 15-25%, while the PROBABILITY of positive market returns is 70-80%.

**Expected value calculation:**
- Hold 44% cash 6 months: Expected cost = 70% probability * 4% return missed * 44% = -1.2% of portfolio
- Deploy now and face correction: 20% probability * 15% drop * 44% deployed = -1.3% of portfolio
- Deploy now and market rises: 80% probability * 5% gain * 44% = +1.8% of portfolio
- **Net expected value of deploying now: +0.5% vs holding cash**

### Suggested Test
- **Immediate:** Calculate the exact amount of cash that should be deployed NOW into existing Tier A positions via ADD triggers. Answer: LULU at $160 (if it drops 7% from current), AUTO.L at 450p (if it drops 7%), BYIT.L at 260p (if drops 12%).
- **Within 2 weeks:** After MONY.L (Feb 23), EDEN.PA (Feb 24), VICI (Feb 25), UHS (Feb 25), WKL.AS (Feb 25), DTE.DE (Feb 26) earnings, we will have clarity on 6 positions + 1 pipeline stock. That is the natural deployment window.
- **Hard rule:** By March 15, 2026, cash must be below 30%. If it is not, conduct a formal review of whether the buy process is too slow for the sell process.

## Summary Verdict Table

| # | Assumption | Severity | Counter Strength | Key Evidence |
|---|-----------|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| 1 | Europe is cheap vs US | MODERATE | Partial | Productivity gap widening, but our stocks have specific catalysts |
| 2 | Quality always beats value | MODERATE | Partial | Quality had worst year in decades, but now cheapened to attractive levels |
| 3 | UK concentration is safe | HIGH | Strong | 5/13 positions exposed to correlated UK risks (NI hike, GBP, politics) |
| 4 | Probation is rigorous | HIGH | Strong | Disposition effect evidence; no hard timelines; MoS ~0% on probation stocks |
| 5 | 44% cash is temporary | CRITICAL | Strong | Opportunity cost EUR ~388/year; no rapid deployment mechanism; process gap |

## Global Verdict: **STRONG COUNTER**

**3 out of 5 assumptions have HIGH or CRITICAL counter-evidence.** The portfolio is not in immediate danger of catastrophic loss, but it is bleeding value through:
1. Cash drag (44% earning nothing)
2. Probation inercia (13% in near-zero-return positions)
3. Geographic concentration (24% in correlated UK risk)

Combined, approximately 81% of the portfolio is either uninvested (44% cash), in dead money (13% probation), or geographically concentrated (24% UK). Only the remaining positions provide genuine diversified return potential.

## Recommendations to Investment Committee

1. **IMMEDIATE: Resolve probation positions by March 15, 2026.** Apply the "fresh money test" to ALL, VICI, and UHS. If the answer is "I would not buy this today," sell immediately. No extensions.

2. **IMMEDIATE: Set cash deployment targets.** By earnings week (Feb 23-26), define SPECIFIC deployment plans for at least EUR 1,500 of the EUR 4,844 cash. Consider lowering ADD triggers for existing Tier A positions to accelerate deployment.

3. **BEFORE NEXT PURCHASE: Non-UK mandatory.** The next new position must be non-UK to reduce geographic concentration from 5/13 to 5/14. Pipeline candidates: DNLM.L should be deprioritized vs NVO ADD, ADBE ADD, or new non-UK Tier A.

4. **QUARTERLY: Track factor regime.** Monitor quality vs value factor performance. If quality underperforms for another 2 quarters, consider whether the timing of our strategic shift was premature.

5. **PROCESS: Speed up the buy pipeline.** The 4-round adversarial process is rigorous and valuable, but it takes 1-2 sessions per stock. With 44% cash and 13 positions, we need to analyze 3-5 stocks simultaneously to deploy within a reasonable timeframe.

## META-REFLECTION

### Doubts/Uncertainties
- I could not find definitive data on the exact current QS-adjusted MoS for every probation position. The numbers I used come from the thesis files and adversarial reviews, which may be slightly stale.
- The expected value calculation for cash deployment assumes a "normal" market environment. If we are truly in a late-cycle bubble, holding 44% cash could be brilliant -- but I cannot determine cycle timing with confidence.
- The UK concentration argument is strong on paper, but if each UK company has a genuine monopoly/duopoly (AUTO.L, MONY.L, BYIT.L), idiosyncratic moats may dominate over macro UK risks.

### Limitations of This Analysis
- I did not run price_checker.py or portfolio_stats.py for real-time data. The analysis uses data from thesis files and state/system.yaml.
- The factor performance data (quality vs value) is global, not specific to our micro-cap/mid-cap UK-heavy portfolio. Factor rotation in small-cap UK may differ from global patterns.
- Behavioral bias (disposition effect) is documented academically but I cannot prove it applies to our specific decision-making process without a controlled experiment.

### Suggestions for the System
1. **Create a "probation timer" in state/system.yaml** that tracks days-on-probation per position. Positions exceeding 60 days should auto-flag for forced review.
2. **Add a "cash deployment target" to pipeline_tracker** with a date-based commitment (e.g., "reduce cash below 30% by March 15").
3. **Implement a geographic concentration alert** in portfolio_stats.py that flags when any single country exceeds 4 positions.
4. **Add a "fresh money test" to review-agent** as a mandatory gate for HOLD decisions on probation positions.

### Questions for Orchestrator
1. The adversarial review sold 8 positions rapidly. Was a deployment plan prepared BEFORE the selling began, or did we sell first and plan later?
2. Can we lower ADD triggers for existing Tier A positions (LULU, AUTO.L, BYIT.L) by 3-5% to accelerate cash deployment?
3. Should we consider a "barbell" approach: deploy 15-20% of cash into a broad quality ETF (like MSCI World Quality) as a bridge while individual stock analysis continues?
4. The probation positions have upcoming earnings (Feb 25). What is the SPECIFIC decision framework: what exact result leads to SELL vs UPGRADE? Not "evaluate" -- what number?
