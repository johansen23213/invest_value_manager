# Investment Committee Decision: VLTO (Veralto Corporation)

> **Date:** 2026-02-14, Session 70
> **Pipeline:** R4 COMPLETE (re-run after Session 69 crash)
> **Verdict:** WATCHLIST with Standing Order at $80

---

## Precedentes Consultados (PASO 0.5)

Before evaluating gates, I identified the 3 most relevant precedents:

**1. ROP (Roper Technologies) — Most analogous**
- Tier B (upper), QS Tool 48 / Adj 70 (+22 adjustment)
- Standing order $300 (22% MoS vs FV $385)
- Serial acquirer with goodwill-distorted ROIC
- Danaher-heritage operational system (similar to VLTO's VES)
- 2 CRITICAL risks (balance sheet + DOGE structural)
- Sizing: 4% (~EUR 400)
- Outcome: Standing order pending, valid until Q1 2026 earnings
- **Relevance:** Both are Danaher-type compounders with large QS adjustments, M&A-dependent growth, and standing orders requiring price discipline. ROP had +22 adjustment (committee approved); VLTO has +14.

**2. DSY.PA (Dassault Systemes) — Standing order precedent**
- Approved standing order EUR 15.50, ~EUR 400
- Full adversarial pipeline completed
- Industrial software, Tier B
- **Relevance:** Pipeline standing order with similar sizing. Price discipline required.

**3. BYIT.L (Bytes Technology) — Tier B buy precedent**
- QS 68 (Adj 69-72), Tier B
- MoS 35% at entry (296p), bought directly
- Later re-evaluated: QS 81 -> 68-72, FV 455 -> 345
- **Relevance:** Similar QS range to VLTO (66-68). BYIT was bought at entry price with 35% MoS. VLTO at $80 would have 20% MoS -- notably lower.

**Deviation analysis:** I am accepting 20% MoS for VLTO Tier B vs 35% MoS for BYIT Tier B. This is justified because:
- VLTO has wider moat sources (dual #1 market positions, regulatory mandates, 61% recurring)
- VLTO has lower value trap risk (0/10 vs BYIT's Microsoft EA disintermediation risk)
- VLTO has stronger balance sheet (0.5x leverage vs BYIT net cash -- both strong)
- ROP precedent accepted 22% MoS for Tier B with even higher risk (2 CRITICAL vs 2 HIGH)
- The lower MoS is compensated by wider moat and lower value trap score

## GATE 0: SECTOR VIEW EXISTS (HARD BLOCK)

```
Sector identified: Environmental Services / Water Technology
Glob result: world/sectors/environmental-water.md EXISTS
Sector view verified: environmental-water.md (created 2026-02-13)
Status: NEUTRAL -- Select individual quality compounders
VLTO listed in Dependencias Activas and Analizadas sections
```

**PASSED. Proceeding to Gates 1-9.**

---

## Gate 1: QUALITY SCORE (CRITICAL)

```
[x] QS Tool: 52/100 (Tier C)
[x] QS Adjusted: 66/100 (Tier B — mid-range)
[x] Adjustment: +14 points (R3 resolved from +16)
[x] Tier assigned: B
[x] NOT Tier D — proceed
```

### QS Adjustment Breakdown (+14)

| Adjustment | Points | Evidence | R3 Change |
|------------|--------|----------|-----------|
| Market Position (#1 Hach + #1 Videojet) | +8 | GM Insights, FMI market reports, Morningstar | No change |
| ROIC Persistence (Danaher-era data) | +1 | 23-25% ROIC for 5+ years pre-spinoff, 2/2 years post-spinoff | Reduced from +2 (Envista precedent, only 2.5yr standalone) |
| Revenue CAGR correction | +2 | FY2025 actual +6.0% total, +4.7% core (vs tool 3.3% CAGR) | Reduced from +3 (Q4 deceleration, pricing-driven) |
| EPS CAGR correction | +3 | FY2026E $4.15 = +6-12% growth from $3.76 | No change |
| **Total** | **+14** | | **From +16** |

**Committee assessment:** The +14 adjustment is appropriate. It is lower than ROP's +22 (which had committee approval) and addresses the moat-assessor's recommendation of +12 to +14. The adjustment primarily corrects for spinoff data distortion, not quality inflation. As more standalone data accumulates (FY2025-FY2027), the tool QS should naturally rise to 62-68 and the adjustment should shrink.

**QS Tool-First compliance:** Both scores documented. Tier determined by Adjusted score (66 = Tier B).

## Gate 2: Business Understanding

```
[x] Business Analysis Framework completed (in thesis.md)
[x] Can explain in 2 minutes:
    - Veralto is a Danaher spinoff operating dual #1 positions in water quality
      analytics (Hach) and coding/marking (Videojet). 61% recurring revenue from
      razor/blade consumables. Regulatory mandates (EPA, EU Water Directive) make
      testing non-discretionary. VES operational discipline drives 60% GM and
      23-25% ROIC. Growth: 3-5% organic + 2-3% M&A + margin expansion.
[x] Know WHY it is cheap:
    - Spinoff discount (fading), slow organic growth perceived as "boring," China
      weakness (6.4% revenue), conservative guidance, tariff overhang
[x] Counter-thesis documented:
    - Quality is permanent, spinoff discount is temporary
    - 3-5% organic + M&A = 6-8% total = adequate for defensive compounder
    - PFAS optionality (diminished but not zero)
[x] Value trap checklist: 1/10 SI (goodwill >50% equity — spinoff structure)
    - 1 factor: No concern. Goodwill is from Danaher allocation, not failed M&A.
[x] Informational advantage: Longer time horizon, spinoff discount recognition,
    VES/DBS heritage not fully appreciated by market
```

**PASSED.**

---

## Gate 3: Projections

```
[x] Revenue growth DERIVED (not default):
    - TAM growth 5-7% (GM Insights, Grand View Research)
    - Market share: stable #1 in both segments
    - Pricing: ~2%/year (CPI-linked contracts)
    - M&A: 2-3% incremental (management pipeline)
    - Organic: 3-5% (R3 revised from 4-5%)
    - Total: 5-8%
[x] WACC CALCULATED: 9.5%
    - Rf 4.5% + Beta 1.11 * ERP 5.5% = Ke 10.6%
    - Kd after-tax 4.3%
    - E/V 90%, D/V 10%
    - Normalized to 9.5% (beta likely elevated for recent spinoff)
[x] Terminal growth: 2.5% (below GDP, appropriate for mature industrial)
[x] Scenarios documented (R3 revised):
    - Bear: $75 (25-30% probability) — China recession, tariff escalation, M&A missteps
    - Base: $100 (45-50% probability) — Steady 5% core + VES + bolt-on M&A
    - Bull: $120 (20-25% probability) — M&A accelerates, some PFAS benefit, margin expansion
```

**R3 revision notes:** Organic growth assumption lowered from 4-5% to 3-5%. PFAS removed from bull case (EPA rollback Sep 2025). Bull case FV reduced from $135 to $120. Bear case probability increased from 25% to 25-30%.

**PASSED.**

---

## Gate 4: Multi-Method Valuation

```
[x] Methods appropriate for Tier B industrial compounder:
    - Tier B: DCF/appropriate + secondary

[x] Method 1 (60%): EV/EBITDA Normalized
    - FY2026E EBITDA ~$1,550M
    - Applied multiple: 17x (discount to peers CTAS 24x, ROL 28x, WAT 22x, ECL 20x)
    - EV: $26,350M - $640M net debt = $25,710M equity
    - FV: $104/share
    - 17x justified: limited standalone track record, slower growth, China exposure

[x] Method 2 (40%): Owner Earnings Yield
    - FY2025 FCF: $1,020M
    - OEY at current $93: 4.4%
    - OEY + Growth (7-8%): 11.4-12.4% vs WACC 9.5%
    - OEY at 4.0% target: $103/share

[x] Weighted FV: (104 * 0.60) + (103 * 0.40) = $103.6
    - R3 rounded to $100 (applying DA corrections on growth and PFAS)

[x] Divergence between methods: 1.0% — excellent convergence
```

**Cross-checks:**
- DCF range: $95-110 (consistent)
- Morningstar: $95 (conservative, pre-Q4)
- Analyst consensus: $109-114 (above our FV)
- Jefferies PT: $105 (exactly our pre-R3 FV -- when the skeptic agrees, we are not conservative)
- UBS PT: $102

**R3 adjustment rationale:** Weighted FV of $104 rounded DOWN to $100 to account for: (a) DA correction that FV $105 matched Jefferies bear analyst PT, (b) removal of PFAS from bull case, (c) lower organic growth assumption. This is a 4% haircut from the pure quantitative output.

**PASSED.**

---

## Gate 5: Margin of Safety (Razonado v4.0)

```
[x] Tier: B (QS 66)
[x] MoS at current $92.54 vs Base $100: 7.5%
[x] MoS at entry $80 vs Base $100: 20.0%
[x] MoS at entry $80 vs Bear $75: -6.7% (RISK)
```

**Razonamiento:**

At current price ($92.54), 7.5% MoS is clearly insufficient for Tier B. Precedents show:
- ROP (Tier B): standing order at 22% MoS
- BYIT.L (Tier B): bought at 35% MoS (but later re-evaluated down)
- Tier B typical pattern: 20-25% MoS

At entry $80, MoS is 20% — at the lower end of Tier B precedents but justified because:
1. WIDE moat sources (Morningstar confirmed) reduce downside risk relative to typical Tier B
2. 61% recurring revenue provides FCF stability even in recession
3. 0/10 value trap (vs ROP which had 2 CRITICAL risks at 22% MoS)
4. ROIC 23-25% >> WACC 10% — massive positive spread
5. VES operational discipline has 30+ year track record

**MoS vs Bear concern:** Entry $80 vs bear $75 = only -6.7% buffer. This is the weakest point of the thesis. Mitigants:
- Bear case requires China recession + tariff escalation + M&A failure simultaneously (25-30% probability)
- Even bear case assumes ROIC > WACC (multiple compression, not business failure)
- 61% recurring revenue means FCF does not collapse in recession
- I accept this tight bear-case buffer because the bear case itself has limited permanent capital loss risk

**Precedent comparison:**
- ROP at $300: 22% MoS, bear case -$50 below entry (17% buffer to bear). VLTO at $80: 20% MoS, bear case -$5 below entry (6.7% risk to bear). ROP has better bear-case protection but also had 2 CRITICAL risks vs VLTO's 2 HIGH risks.

**Deviation from BYIT precedent documented above in PASO 0.5.**

**CONDITIONAL PASS — only at $80 entry, NOT at current price.**

## Gate 6: Macro Context

```
[x] World view reviewed (2026-02-11, 3 days ago — fresh)
[x] Cycle: Mid-cycle US, labor resilient, inflation sticky
[x] Fit empresa-ciclo:
    - Water testing is regulatory-mandated = recession-resistant
    - CPI-linked contracts = inflation-protected
    - 0.5x leverage = rate-insensitive
    - Defensive characteristics appropriate for any cycle phase
[x] Megatendencias:
    - Water infrastructure spending (IIJA): POSITIVE
    - AI/Automation: NEUTRAL (not a target of AI disruption)
    - Deregulation risk: MODERATE (EPA PFAS rollback, but core water testing mandates unchanged)
    - Tariffs: LOW-MODERATE (manageable, easing by H2 2026)
```

**PASSED.**

---

## Gate 7: Portfolio Fit (Razonado v4.0)

```
Constraint checker results (simulated EUR 400 buy):

[x] Price verified: $92.54 / EUR 77.95 (2026-02-14)
[x] Sizing proposed: 4% (~EUR 400)

[x] Position post-purchase: 4.0%
    - Coherent with conviction? YES. Medium conviction for Tier B, 4% is
      consistent with ROP (4%), DSY.PA (4%), BYIT.L (3.5%) precedents.
    - 50% drop impact: -2.0% portfolio — acceptable for medium conviction.

[x] Sector post-purchase: Industrials 4.0%
    - No concentration issue. Currently zero exposure to environmental/water.
    - This adds NEW sector diversification, which is positive.

[x] Geography post-purchase: US 18.5%
    - US exposure well within comfortable range. Currently under-allocated to US
      relative to US market cap weight.

[x] Cash post-purchase: 53.0% (EUR 5,352)
    - Ample. Cash deployment is a priority (Principio 4) but this is a standing
      order, not immediate deployment. Cash remains available for other pipeline
      opportunities (RSG, ROP, CDNS, etc.).

[x] Correlation with existing positions: LOW
    - No environmental/water exposure currently
    - Not correlated with UK platforms (MONY.L, AUTO.L, BYIT.L)
    - Not correlated with pharma (NVO) or insurance (ALL, GL)
    - Some mild positive correlation with ADBE/EDEN.PA through general
      "quality industrial" factor
```

**Precedent sizing:** ROP at 4% for Tier B upper with 2 CRITICAL risks. VLTO at 4% for Tier B mid with 2 HIGH risks. Consistent.

**PASSED.**

---

## Gate 8: Sector Understanding

```
[x] Sector view exists: world/sectors/environmental-water.md
[x] Sector view reviewed (2026-02-13 — 1 day old, fresh)
[x] TAM and trends understood:
    - Water quality analytics TAM ~$4-5B, growing 5-7% CAGR
    - Coding & marking TAM ~$7B, growing 6.1% CAGR
    - Structurally defensive (recession-resistant, regulatory-mandated)
[x] Disruption risks known:
    - Chinese low-cost competitors in Asia-Pacific (MEDIUM probability)
    - VES discipline erosion post-Danaher (LOW-MEDIUM probability)
    - Technology disruption from IoT sensors (LOW probability)
[x] Sector position: NEUTRAL (select quality compounders)
    - VLTO identified as one of the "enablers" = highest quality sub-segment
```

**PASSED.**

---

## Gate 9: Autocritique

```
[x] Unvalidated assumptions:
    1. VES discipline transfers successfully post-Danaher (Envista counter-example)
    2. Organic growth sustains 3-5% (Q4 showed deceleration, Q1 guide weak)
    3. M&A execution works at scale (In-Situ is first test, small)
    4. 17x EBITDA multiple is appropriate (peers at 18-28x have higher growth)
    5. Goodwill is from quality acquisitions (cannot verify segment-level pre-spinoff)

[x] Biases recognized:
    - Danaher halo effect: DBS reputation may cause overconfidence in VES transfer
    - Morningstar Wide Moat anchoring: Their wide moat rating may anchor our moat assessment higher
    - Confirmation bias: R1 analyst may have started with "this is a quality Danaher spinoff" narrative
    - Popularity bias: VLTO is a well-covered mid-large cap, not an undiscovered gem

[x] Kill conditions defined (6):
    1. KC#1: ROIC < WACC for 2+ consecutive quarters
    2. KC#2: Recurring revenue drops below 55%
    3. KC#3: FCF < $700M for full fiscal year
    4. KC#4: VES discipline abandoned (margin stalls 3+ years or undisciplined M&A)
    5. KC#5: Regulatory deregulation in water testing
    6. KC#6: CEO departure without credible DBS-culture successor

[x] What would change my mind:
    - If FY2026 organic growth comes in below 2% — thesis of "steady industrial compounder" breaks
    - If In-Situ integration shows negative ROIC impact after 12 months — VES execution failed
    - If CEO Honeycutt departs or >2 C-suite executives leave within 12 months — DBS culture risk
    - If Envista-like trajectory emerges (declining margins, CEO change needed)
```

**PASSED.**

## Gate 10: Counter-Analysis & Independent Assessments

```
[x] counter_analysis.md EXISTS (devils_advocate.md)
[x] Verdict: 10/20 MODERATE COUNTER
[x] Total challenges: 18 (6 HIGH)
[x] R3 resolution applied all material corrections

HIGH challenges resolution:
```

| # | HIGH Challenge | R3 Resolution | Status |
|---|---------------|---------------|--------|
| 2 | Envista precedent (Danaher spinoff destroyed value) | Acknowledged. VLTO in structurally different markets (regulatory water vs dental commoditization). But VES persistence reduced to +1 (from +2) pending more data. Bear case probability raised 25-30%. | RESOLVED — risk accepted and priced |
| 6 | PEG 2.52 signals overvaluation | Addressed by NOT buying at current price. Entry at $80 (P/E ~19x at FY2026E $4.15) has PEG ~1.9x — more reasonable. | RESOLVED — price discipline |
| 9 | Bear case $75 means $85 entry has negative MoS vs bear | Entry lowered to $80. Still only 6.7% above bear — tight, but bear case requires simultaneous failure of multiple assumptions. | RESOLVED — accepted residual risk |
| 11 | PFAS regulatory rollback | Removed from bull case. Bull FV reduced from $135 to $120. Expected value drops. | RESOLVED |
| 14 | Two HIGH risks correlated (CEO M&A + organic growth) | Acknowledged in kill conditions and monitoring plan. If organic growth <2% for 2yr = exit. If M&A fails = exit. Correlation means both triggers are more likely to fire together. | RESOLVED — kill conditions address |
| 3 (Challenge) | QS adjustment +16 too aggressive | Reduced to +14 per moat-assessor recommendation. QS 66 vs 68 — still Tier B. | RESOLVED |

```
[x] moat_assessment.md EXISTS
    - Classification: NARROW (leaning WIDE) — agrees with R3 resolution
    - Moat-assessor recommended +12-14 QS adjustment; R3 chose +14 (upper bound)
    - Switching costs (9/10) and intangible assets (4/5) are primary moat sources
    - Key uncertainty: standalone ROIC persistence (only 2.5 years)

[x] risk_assessment.md EXISTS
    - Overall risk: MEDIUM
    - 2 HIGH risks: CEO M&A execution + low organic growth
    - Correlated risks acknowledged and addressed in kill conditions
    - Kill conditions from risk-identifier incorporated into thesis KCs
    - Additional suggested KC: Senior management exodus (3+ C-suite in 12mo)
      — ADDED as monitoring item

[x] No valuation_report.md exists (no separate valuation specialist output)
    — Documented. Valuation done within thesis by fundamental-analyst.
    — Two methods used (EV/EBITDA + OEY) with cross-checks (DCF, Morningstar, analysts).
    — Sufficient for R4 evaluation.

Unresolved conflicts: NONE after R3 resolution.
All material DA challenges were addressed through FV reduction ($105->$100),
entry reduction ($85->$80), QS adjustment reduction (+16->+14), PFAS removal,
and bear case probability increase.
```

**PASSED.**

## VERDICT: WATCHLIST with Standing Order at $80

### Recommendation

```
WATCHLIST: VLTO (Veralto Corporation)
Quality Score: 66/100 (Tool 52 + 14 adj) -> Tier B (mid-range)
Fair Value: $100 (R3 resolved)
Current Price: $92.54 (MoS 7.5% — INSUFFICIENT)
Entry Price: $80 (MoS 20.0% — ADEQUATE for Tier B with wide moat)
Condition: Standing order at $80, sizing 4% (~EUR 400)
Valid until: Q1 FY2026 earnings (April/May 2026) — re-evaluate after

Moat: NARROW (leaning WIDE) — switching costs + intangibles + VES
Risk: MEDIUM (2 correlated HIGH: CEO M&A execution + organic growth)
Riesgo principal: Envista-like VES deterioration + organic growth stuck at 3%
Kill condition: ROIC < WACC 2Q, recurring rev <55%, FCF <$700M, VES abandoned, CEO exit
Precedent sizing: ROP 4% Tier B standing order, DSY.PA 4% standing order
```

### Why WATCHLIST (not BUY, not REJECT)

**Not BUY because:**
1. At $92.54, MoS is only 7.5% — clearly insufficient for Tier B
2. No immediate catalyst to compress price to $80 (Q1 guide is flat/weak, may provide opportunity)
3. Other pipeline candidates are closer to actionable: RSG (Feb 17 earnings gate), ROP ($300, 10.6% away)

**Not REJECT because:**
1. Genuine quality business: 60% GM, 25% ROIC, dual #1 positions, regulatory moat
2. 0/10 value trap — this is NOT a value trap
3. 10/20 MODERATE COUNTER from DA — thesis survives with corrections
4. At $80, risk/reward is attractive (20% MoS, 12-13% expected return via OEY + growth)
5. VES operational discipline is a genuine competitive advantage, even if execution is uncertain

### Standing Order Parameters

```
Ticker: VLTO
Trigger: $80.00
Sizing: ~4% of portfolio (~EUR 400 at current portfolio ~EUR 10,000)
Shares at $80: ~6 shares (EUR 400 / EUR 67.40 at current FX)
Valid until: Q1 FY2026 earnings (April/May 2026)
Re-evaluate if: (a) Q1 misses guidance, (b) CEO/C-suite departure, (c) M&A > $1B announced
```

### Monitoring Plan

| Item | Frequency | Action Trigger |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| Price vs $80 entry | Weekly (quality_universe.py) | If within 5%, alert |
| Q1 FY2026 earnings | Event (April/May 2026) | Re-evaluate thesis |
| CEO/C-suite departures | Ongoing (news-monitor) | If 2+ in 12mo, escalate |
| M&A announcements | Ongoing (news-monitor) | If >$1B, re-evaluate moat assessment |
| Organic growth trajectory | Quarterly | If <2% for 2Q, impair thesis |
| PFAS regulatory updates | Quarterly | Update sector view |

## META-REFLECTION

### Dudas sobre esta decision

- **Bear case proximity to entry is my primary concern.** Entry $80 is only $5 above bear $75. If the bear case materializes, I lose the MoS AND more. However, this bear case requires three independent negative scenarios (China, tariffs, M&A failure) to coincide, and even the bear case assumes ROIC > WACC (just multiple compression, not value destruction). I accept this risk but flag it.

- **The +14 QS adjustment is large.** Even at +14 (reduced from +16), this is the second-largest adjustment in the universe after ROP (+22). The adjustment is well-documented and primarily corrects for spinoff data distortion, but I am relying heavily on pre-spinoff Danaher data that cannot be independently verified at the segment level. If the true QS is closer to 60 (only +8 adjustment), the MoS at $80 (20%) would be marginal for lower-end Tier B.

- **Envista is a real counter-precedent.** The DA's strongest argument is that Envista (previous Danaher spinoff) has destroyed value over 6+ years. The differences are real (dental commoditization vs regulatory water) but the pattern of DBS failing post-spinoff is concerning. I weight this at 15% probability (VES cultural decay scenario in moat assessment).

### Debilidades del analisis recibido

- **No separate valuation_report.md.** The valuation was done within the thesis by the fundamental-analyst rather than by an independent valuation-specialist agent. This means there is no truly independent FV estimate. The two methods used (EV/EBITDA + OEY) converge at $103-104, which is reassuring, but a third-party perspective would add confidence.

- **China revenue by segment is estimated, not verified.** The thesis says 6.4% of total revenue, the risk assessment estimates 10-15% of Water Quality specifically. Neither could access the 10-K for exact figures. This matters because China exposure concentration in the higher-value WQ segment increases the risk.

- **CEO leadership assessment relies on one source.** The Paragon Intel "reportedly corrosive" characterization is strong but singular. I cannot verify this independently. If accurate, it is material. If overstated, it reduces the CEO M&A execution risk.

- **Forward growth assumption (3-5% organic) is still optimistic.** Q4 WQ core growth was only 1.4%, Q1 FY2026 guide is flat-to-low-single-digit. The DA correctly flags that growth may be structurally lower than projected. If organic settles at 2-3%, the "compounder" thesis weakens significantly.

### Sugerencias de mejora

1. **Quality_scorer.py spinoff handling:** The tool should have a `--spinoff-years N` flag that uses parent company data for ROIC persistence. This would prevent systematic underscoring of recent spinoffs and reduce the need for large manual adjustments.

2. **Dividend yield bug:** The tool shows 56.0% yield for VLTO (actual ~0.5%). This is a yfinance data error that should be caught and flagged automatically.

3. **Danaher spinoff tracking:** Add Envista (NVST) and Fortive (FTV) post-spinoff performance as a standing comparison for any Danaher-heritage investment. This system-level learning should inform future analysis.

4. **Large QS adjustment protocol:** Any adjustment >10 points should require DA review before committee (the DA DID review this, so the process worked, but it should be formalized).

### Preguntas para Orchestrator

1. Should we add VLTO standing order to state/system.yaml now, or wait for human confirmation?
2. RSG has Q4 earnings Feb 17 (hard gate) — should we prioritize VLTO or RSG for capital deployment given limited cash ($5,752)?
3. The VLTO standing order at $80 requires a 13.6% decline from current $92.54. Q1 earnings (April/May 2026) could be the catalyst if guidance disappoints. Should we set a calendar reminder for Q1 earnings as a thesis re-evaluation trigger?
