## TL;DR

Veralto is a Danaher spinoff (Sep 2023) operating in water quality analytics (#1 via Hach) and product identification (#1 via Videojet). The business has a NARROW moat (leaning WIDE pending 5yr standalone data) from regulatory mandates, installed-base razor/blade economics (61% recurring revenue), and VES operational discipline. At $93, the stock trades near its 52-week low with 7% MoS vs R3-revised $100 FV. Entry target $80 provides 20% MoS appropriate for QS 66 Tier B. Q4 2025 beat EPS ($1.04 vs $0.98). FY2026 guide $4.10-$4.20 EPS with >$1B FCF. **R3 corrections:** FV $105→$100, Entry $85→$80, QS +16→+14 (66), moat WIDE→NARROW, PFAS bull case removed (EPA rollback Sep 2025).

### QS Tool Breakdown (52/100)

| Category | Score | Max | Notes |
|----------|-------|-----|-------|
| **Financial (23/40)** | | | |
| ROIC Spread | 0/15 | 15 | ROIC nan% — tool cannot calculate (spinoff data gap) |
| FCF Margin | 8/10 | 10 | ~17% FCF margin (good, not exceptional) |
| Leverage | 10/10 | 10 | 0.5x Net Debt/EBITDA — excellent |
| FCF Consistency | 5/5 | 5 | 4/4 years positive (limited history) |
| **Growth (9/25)** | | | |
| Revenue CAGR | 2/10 | 10 | +3.3% (artificially low — spinoff base effect) |
| EPS CAGR | 2/10 | 10 | +3.1% (same distortion) |
| GM Trend | 5/5 | 5 | 56.7% -> 57.8% -> 59.8% (expanding) |
| **Moat (15/25)** | | | |
| GM Premium | 10/10 | 10 | +31.8pp vs sector median 28% |
| Market Position | 0/8 | 8 | Tool default 0 (manual assessment needed) |
| ROIC Persistence | 5/7 | 7 | Tool only has 2 years post-spinoff |
| **Cap Alloc (5/10)** | | | |
| Shareholder Returns | 5/5 | 5 | Dividend + $750M buyback program |
| Insider Ownership | 0/5 | 5 | 0.1% insider ownership (institutional 97.7%) |

### QS Adjustment Rationale (+16 points)

**1. Market Position: +8 points (0 -> 8/8)**
- Hach: #1 in water quality analytics globally (18% market share in portable, 16% overall)
- Videojet: #1 in coding & marking globally (18% share, larger than #2 Markem-Imaje at 15%)
- Both segments hold undisputed leadership positions in their respective markets
- Evidence: Market research reports (GM Insights, FMI), Morningstar WIDE moat rating
- This is the most clear-cut +8 adjustment — dual #1 positions in distinct markets

**2. ROIC Persistence: +1 point (5 -> 6/7)** *(R3 revised from +2)*
- Tool only has 2 years of standalone data (FY2023-FY2024)
- Pre-spinoff ROIC as Danaher segment: 23-25% sustained for 10+ years
- Post-spinoff ROIC: 23.3% (2023), 25.1% (2024) — improving
- R3 rationale: Moat-assessor recommended caution — only 2.5 years standalone data is insufficient for full +2. Envista (previous Danaher spinoff) had similarly good initial ROIC but later deteriorated. Grant +1, revisit after FY2026 results.

**3. Revenue/Growth Context: +5 points** *(R3 revised from +6)*
- FY2025 actual: $5,503M (+6.0% total, +4.7% core) — stronger than tool's 3.3% CAGR
- BUT: Q4 2025 WQ core growth only 1.4%, FY2026 Q1 guide flat-to-low-single-digit (deceleration)
- DA correctly flags growth is pricing-driven, not volume-driven
- Revenue CAGR: adjust from 2 -> 4/10 (+2 points, conservative given deceleration)
- EPS CAGR: FY2026 guide $4.10-$4.20 = 6-12% growth; adjust 2 -> 5/10 (+3 points)

**Total adjustment: +8 (market position) + 1 (ROIC persistence) + 5 (growth correction) = +14**

### Adjusted QS: 66/100 (Tier B — mid-range)

### R3 Resolution Notes
- DA scored 10/20 MODERATE COUNTER — thesis survives but needs corrections
- Moat-assessor recommended +12-14 adjustment; I chose +14 as upper-bound compromise
- Envista precedent (Danaher dental spinoff, -14% since 2019 IPO) noted as risk but not directly analogous (dental vs regulatory water quality)
- PFAS regulatory rollback (EPA Sep 2025) removes this from bull case
- Two HIGH risks are correlated (CEO M&A + organic growth) — acknowledged

**Note:** With more standalone data years (FY2025-FY2026), the tool QS should naturally rise to 65-72 as growth metrics and ROIC capture full-year standalone performance. The adjustment is primarily correcting for spinoff data distortion, not inflating quality.

## Business Understanding

### What Veralto Does

Veralto operates two complementary segments that together form a "critical infrastructure quality assurance" platform:

**1. Water Quality (WQ) — ~60% of revenue ($3.3B)**
- **Hach** (analytics): #1 globally in water testing instruments and reagents. Measures chlorine, pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and contaminants in drinking water, wastewater, and industrial water. Customers: municipal water utilities, industrial plants, food/beverage manufacturers.
- **ChemTreat** (treatment): Water treatment chemicals and services. Helps industrial customers optimize boiler, cooling, and process water systems.
- **Trojan Technologies** (UV treatment): Ultraviolet water treatment systems for municipal and industrial disinfection.
- **SeaBird Scientific** (marine analytics): Oceanographic instruments and sensors.

**2. Product Quality & Innovation (PQI) — ~40% of revenue ($2.2B)**
- **Videojet** (coding): #1 globally in industrial coding and marking. Prints expiration dates, lot numbers, barcodes on food, beverage, pharmaceutical, and consumer goods packaging. Regulatory mandate in most developed markets.
- **Linx** (coding): Complementary to Videojet, focused on smaller industrial printing.
- **Esko** (packaging): Packaging design and workflow software for brand owners and converters.
- **X-Rite/Pantone** (color): Color science, measurement, and standards. Pantone is the global standard for color communication.

### Revenue Model: Razor/Blade (CRITICAL)

**61% of revenue is recurring** from consumables, reagents, inks, and services.

The model works as follows:
1. **RAZOR** (equipment sale): Hach instrument or Videojet printer placed at customer site
2. **BLADE** (consumables): Reagents, inks, spare parts, calibration services purchased repeatedly
3. **LOCK-IN**: Equipment is mission-critical and regulated; switching requires revalidation, retraining, and regulatory re-approval
4. **MARGIN EXPANSION**: Consumables carry higher margins than equipment; as installed base grows, margin mix improves

This is one of the strongest razor/blade models outside of healthcare because:
- Water testing is LEGALLY MANDATED (EPA, EU Water Framework Directive)
- Product coding is LEGALLY MANDATED (FDA, EU serialization directives)
- Failure to test/code = regulatory shutdown of operations

### Unit Economics

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Revenue: recurring vs one-time | 61% / 39% | Excellent stickiness |
| Gross Margin | 59.8% (FY2024) | Expanding (+3pp in 2 years) |
| Operating Margin | 23.3% (GAAP), 24.6% adj | Strong, improving |
| FCF Margin | ~18-19% ($1.0B / $5.5B) | Solid |
| FCF Conversion | 115% of net income | Excellent |
| Capex as % Revenue | 1.0-1.5% | Asset-light |
| Net Debt/EBITDA | 0.5x | Conservative, M&A capacity |
| LTV/CAC | Not disclosed; razor/blade implies >5x | Excellent |

### Competitive Landscape

**Water Quality Analytics:**
| Company | Market Share | Strengths |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Hach (VLTO)** | ~16-18% | Broadest portfolio, regulatory relationships, global service |
| Xylem/YSI | ~10-12% | Broader water infrastructure exposure |
| Thermo Fisher | ~8-10% | Overlap in lab instruments |
| Endress+Hauser | ~7-9% | Strong in process industries |
| ABB | ~5-7% | Industrial automation overlap |

**Coding & Marking:**
| Company | Market Share | Strengths |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Videojet (VLTO)** | ~18% | Largest installed base, broadest technology portfolio |
| Markem-Imaje (Dover) | ~15% | Strong in food & beverage |
| Domino (Brother) | ~10% | Strong in pharma serialization |
| Keyence | ~7% | Laser marking technology |
| Hitachi | ~5% | Strong in Asia |

**Moat Assessment: WIDE (20/25)**

| Moat Source | Score | Evidence |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| Switching costs | 9/10 | Regulatory revalidation required; mission-critical instruments integrated into LIMS/SCADA; retraining costs |
| Installed base lock-in | 8/10 | 61% recurring revenue from consumables tied to equipment; proprietary reagents/inks |
| Regulatory mandate | 7/10 | Water testing and product coding are legally required in most markets; Hach methods are EPA/ISO reference methods |
| Brand/standards | 6/10 | Pantone IS the global color standard; Hach IS the water testing standard; Videojet brand recognition |
| Network effects | 0/5 | Limited network effects; this is not a platform business |

### Why Is It Cheap?

**Current Price:** $93.09 (near 52-week low of $83.87)
**52-week High:** $110.11

**Market Narrative:**
1. **Spinoff discount (fading):** Institutional investors who received VLTO shares as Danaher distribution may have sold regardless of fundamentals. This effect is diminishing as VLTO builds its own shareholder base.
2. **Slow organic growth:** 4.7% core growth in FY2025 seen as "boring" vs AI/tech darlings. Market wants higher growth for this multiple.
3. **China weakness:** 6.4% of revenue in China; management describes market as "bouncing along bottom." Not forecasting recovery.
4. **Tariff overhang:** Some PQI products manufactured/sourced with tariff exposure. Management expects tariff margin drag to ease by H2 2026.
5. **Guidance perceived as conservative:** FY2026 low-to-mid-single-digit core growth underwhelmed some analysts.

**My Counter-Thesis:**
1. **Spinoff discount is TEMPORARY — the quality is PERMANENT.** This is a wide-moat business with 60% GM, 25% ROIC, and DBS (VES) operational discipline.
2. **4-5% organic growth is the RIGHT rate for this business.** Add 2-3% M&A = 6-8% total revenue growth. Combined with margin expansion + buybacks = 10-12% EPS growth. This is a quality compounder, not a growth stock.
3. **China is only 6.4% of revenue.** Even a 10% decline in China = 0.6% revenue headwind. Immaterial.
4. **PFAS regulation is NOT in guidance.** EPA PFAS testing mandates affect 66,000 public water systems over the next 3-5 years. Hach is the primary beneficiary and this is NOT included in forecasts. This is a free option.
5. **$2B cash + 0.5x leverage = M&A firepower.** Veralto is a proven acquirer (DBS/VES M&A playbook from Danaher). In-Situ acquisition (Jan 2026) is the first bolt-on. More coming.

**Value Trap Checklist: 0/10 — NO VALUE TRAP RISK**

| Factor | SI/NO |
|--------|-------|
| Industry in secular decline | NO — water infrastructure growing 5-7% CAGR |
| Technology disruption imminent | NO — regulatory mandates protect demand |
| Management destroying value | NO — VES discipline, bolt-on M&A |
| Balance deteriorating | NO — 0.5x leverage, $2B cash |
| Insider selling massive | NUANCED — CEO selling is routine 10b5-1, not distress |
| Dividend cut probable | NO — 18% increase, 12% payout ratio |
| Market share loss >2pp | NO — maintaining/gaining share |
| ROIC < WACC last 3 years | NO — ROIC 23-25% vs WACC ~10% |
| FCF negative >2 years | NO — >$1B FCF, 4/4 years positive |
| Goodwill >50% equity | YES — spinoff structure, but not from failed M&A |

### My Informational Advantage
- **Longer time horizon:** Market is punishing slow growth; I can hold 3-5 years for compounding
- **PFAS optionality not priced:** Regulatory tailwind is real but excluded from guidance
- **Spinoff discount fading:** As more quarters report, institutional investors will recognize standalone quality
- **DBS/VES not understood:** Market underestimates the margin expansion + M&A compounding machine

## Projections

### Revenue Projection

| Driver | Input | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Water Quality TAM growth | 5-7% CAGR | GM Insights, Grand View Research |
| Coding & Marking TAM growth | 6.1% CAGR | Fortune Business Insights |
| VLTO market share | Stable #1 in both | No share loss evidence |
| Pricing power | ~2%/year (CPI-linked contracts) | FY2025: 1.9% price component |
| M&A contribution | 2-3%/year | Management indicated bolt-on pipeline |

**Revenue growth derivation:**
- Core organic: TAM 5-6% + pricing 2% + modest share gain = 4-5% core (matches management guide of low-to-mid single digits)
- M&A: 2-3% incremental
- Total revenue growth: 6-8%

### Margin Trajectory

| Metric | FY2024 | FY2025 | FY2026E | FY2028E |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| Gross Margin | 59.8% | ~60.5%* | 61.0% | 62.0% |
| Operating Margin (adj) | 23.8% | 24.6% | 24.9% | 26.0% |
| FCF Margin | 17.5% | ~18.5% | 19.0% | 20.0% |

*Estimated from +20bp guidance. VES margin expansion tool (DBS-derived) supports 25-50bp/year sustainable margin improvement.

### WACC Derivation

| Component | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Risk-Free Rate (10Y UST) | 4.5% | Current |
| Equity Risk Premium | 5.5% | Damodaran |
| Beta | 1.11 | Yahoo Finance (post-spinoff, may be elevated) |
| Cost of Equity (Ke) | 10.6% | 4.5% + 1.11 * 5.5% |
| Cost of Debt (Kd pre-tax) | 5.5% | Estimated (tool default; interest expense data gap) |
| Tax Rate | 22% | VLTO effective rate |
| Kd after-tax | 4.3% | 5.5% * (1 - 0.22) |
| E/V | 90% | Market cap $23.1B / EV ~$23.7B |
| D/V | 10% | Net debt $0.64B / EV ~$23.7B |
| **WACC** | **9.9%** | (0.90 * 10.6%) + (0.10 * 4.3%) |

**Note:** Beta of 1.11 is likely elevated for a recently-spun-off company. A normalized beta of 0.85-0.95 (in line with analytical instruments peers like WAT, A) would reduce WACC to ~9.0-9.5%. I use 9.5% as base case.

### EPS Projection

| Year | Revenue ($M) | Adj OP Margin | Net Income ($M) | Adj EPS | Growth |
|------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|---------|--------|
| FY2025A | 5,503 | 24.6% | 940 | $3.76 | - |
| FY2026E | 5,860 | 24.9% | 1,030 | $4.15 | +10.4% |
| FY2027E | 6,270 | 25.2% | 1,120 | $4.55 | +9.6% |
| FY2028E | 6,720 | 25.5% | 1,220 | $5.00 | +9.9% |
| FY2029E | 7,200 | 25.8% | 1,320 | $5.45 | +9.0% |
| FY2030E | 7,700 | 26.0% | 1,430 | $5.95 | +9.2% |

**Shares declining ~1% per year via $750M buyback program against ~$23B market cap.**

## Valuation

### Method 1: EV/EBITDA Normalized (Primary — 60% weight)

**Rationale:** Tier B industrial compounder with stable FCF. EV/EBITDA is the standard valuation method for industrial quality companies with leverage and M&A.

| Input | Value | Source |
|-------|-------|--------|
| FY2026E EBITDA | ~$1,550M | $5,860M * 24.9% OP margin + ~$90M D&A |
| Forward EV/EBITDA (sector peer range) | 18-22x | CTAS 24x, ROL 28x, WAT 22x, ECL 20x |
| Applied multiple | 17x | Discount to peers: newer standalone, slower growth |
| Enterprise Value | $26,350M | 17x * $1,550M |
| Less: Net Debt | -$640M | |
| Equity Value | $25,710M | |
| Shares | 248M | |
| **FV per share** | **$104** | |

**Why 17x EBITDA?**
- Peer range is 18-28x for wide-moat industrial compounders
- VLTO warrants discount for: (a) limited standalone track record (2.5 years), (b) slower organic growth vs CTAS/ROL, (c) China exposure uncertainty
- But premium vs generic industrials (10-14x) for: (a) 60% GM, (b) 61% recurring revenue, (c) wide moat, (d) VES margin expansion, (e) M&A optionality
- 17x is conservative within the peer range

### Method 2: Owner Earnings Yield (Secondary — 40% weight)

**Rationale:** Quality business approaching Tier A territory. OEY + Growth gives a through-cycle return estimate.

| Input | Value | Source |
|-------|-------|--------|
| FY2025 FCF | $1,020M | Reported (115% of NI) |
| Maintenance Capex | ~$80M | 1.5% of $5,503M revenue |
| Depreciation | ~$90M | |
| Owner Earnings | ~$1,020M | FCF already net of maintenance capex |
| Market Cap | $23,100M | Current |
| **OEY** | **4.4%** | $1,020M / $23,100M |
| Expected Growth | 7-8% | 5% organic + 2-3% M&A |
| **OEY + Growth** | **11.4-12.4%** | vs WACC 9.5% |
| Implied FV (OEY target 5.0%) | $82 | $1,020M / 0.05 / 248M shares |
| Implied FV (OEY target 4.0%) | $103 | $1,020M / 0.04 / 248M shares |

**Interpretation:** At $93, OEY of 4.4% + 7-8% growth = 11.4-12.4% total expected return, which exceeds WACC of 9.5%. This is a reasonable but not exceptional return. At $85 entry, OEY rises to 4.8% and total expected return to 12-13%.

### Method 3: DCF Cross-Check

The DCF tool produced distorted results because it uses historical FCF trajectory from yfinance, which only captures 2-3 years of post-spinoff data with base-year distortions.

Manual DCF sanity check:
- FY2026E FCF: ~$1,100M (assuming ~100% conversion of net income)
- 7% growth for 10 years, 2.5% terminal, 9.5% WACC
- Terminal value methodology (Gordon Growth): TV = $1,100M * (1.07)^10 * (1.025) / (0.095 - 0.025) = substantial
- This produces FV in the $95-110 range depending on assumptions

### Method 4: Analyst Consensus Cross-Check

- Analyst average PT: $109-114
- Morningstar FV: $95 (initiated June 2025 — pre Q4 beat, pre FY2026 guidance)
- Morningstar moat rating: WIDE
- Simply Wall St FV: $110.59

### Reconciliation

| Method | Fair Value | Weight | Weighted |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| EV/EBITDA 17x | $104 | 60% | $62.4 |
| OEY (4.0% target) | $103 | 40% | $41.2 |
| **Weighted FV** | | **100%** | **$104** |
| Rounded | | | **$105** |

**Cross-checks:**
- DCF range: $95-110 (consistent)
- Morningstar: $95 (conservative, pre-Q4)
- Analyst consensus: $109-114 (slightly above)

**I set Fair Value at $105.** This is below analyst consensus but above Morningstar's pre-Q4 estimate, reflecting the recent earnings beat and FY2026 guidance.

### DCF Sensitivity Assessment

```
FV Spread: 102% (from tool sensitivity matrix)
Terminal Value: 57-72% of EV (HIGH)
Assessment: HIGH SENSITIVITY — DCF unreliable as point estimate
Action: Use EV/EBITDA as primary, OEY as secondary. DCF as cross-check only.
```

## Scenarios

| | Bear | Base | Bull |
|--|------|------|------|
| **Assumption** | China recession, tariff escalation, M&A missteps | Steady 5% core growth + VES margin expansion + bolt-on M&A | PFAS regulatory boom + accelerated M&A + margin expansion |
| **Revenue growth** | 2-3% | 6-8% | 9-12% |
| **FY2028E EPS** | $4.20 | $5.00 | $5.80 |
| **FV** | $75 | $105 | $135 |
| **Probability** | 25% | 50% | 25% |

**Expected Value = (75 * 0.25) + (105 * 0.50) + (135 * 0.25) = $105.0**

### Bear Case Details
- China deteriorates further (-15% in WQ China)
- Tariffs on PQI products increase, margin compression 50bp
- In-Situ integration problems; M&A pipeline stalls
- Organic growth slows to 2-3% as macro weakens
- Multiple compresses to 14x EBITDA
- FV ~$75

### Base Case Details
- Steady mid-single-digit organic growth
- VES delivers 25bp/year margin expansion
- 1-2 bolt-on acquisitions per year ($200-500M each)
- PFAS testing creates modest tailwind (not priced in)
- Buyback reduces shares 1%/year
- FV ~$105

### Bull Case Details
- PFAS regulation creates $500M+ annual opportunity for Hach over 3-5 years
- China stimulus drives WQ recovery
- Successful larger M&A (like ChemTreat-scale) at attractive multiples
- VES drives 50bp/year margin expansion
- Multiple expands to 20x EBITDA as market recognizes wide-moat quality
- FV ~$135

## Margin of Safety

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current Price | $93.09 |
| Fair Value (weighted) | $105 |
| **MoS vs Base** | **11.3%** |
| MoS vs Bear | -24.1% (RISK) |
| MoS vs Bull | 31.1% |
| **Required MoS (Tier B, precedent)** | **~20-25%** |
| **Meets requirement?** | **NO — at current price** |

### Entry Price Calculation

For adequate MoS given Tier B classification and precedents:
- 20% MoS: $105 * 0.80 = **$84**
- 15% MoS: $105 * 0.85 = **$89**

**Entry target: $85** (19% MoS — reasonable for upper-Tier-B with wide moat)

**Rationale for accepting 19% MoS at $85 (slightly below 20% precedent):**
1. Wide moat (Morningstar confirmed) reduces downside risk
2. 61% recurring revenue provides FCF stability even in recession
3. PFAS optionality is a free call option not in FV
4. Balance sheet is fortress (0.5x leverage, $2B cash)
5. VES/DBS operational discipline has 30+ year track record from Danaher

---

## Kill Conditions

1. **KC#1: ROIC falls below WACC for 2+ consecutive quarters** — Would signal VES is failing to maintain operational excellence post-spinoff. Currently ROIC ~25% vs WACC 10% — massive spread makes this unlikely but must monitor.

2. **KC#2: Recurring revenue drops below 55%** — The 61% recurring base IS the moat. If it drops, it signals equipment displacement or consumable commoditization.

3. **KC#3: FCF < $700M for a full fiscal year** — FCF just exceeded $1B. A 30% decline would signal structural deterioration, not cyclicality.

4. **KC#4: Management abandons VES discipline** — If margin expansion stalls for 3+ years or M&A becomes undisciplined (overpaying, non-bolt-on deals), the DBS advantage is lost.

5. **KC#5: Regulatory deregulation in water testing** — Extremely unlikely (EPA, EU water directives are strengthening, not weakening). But if PFAS regulation is reversed or water testing requirements are relaxed, the regulatory moat weakens.

6. **KC#6: CEO departure without credible successor** — Jennifer Honeycutt is a Danaher veteran. If she leaves and replacement is from outside the DBS culture, VES discipline may erode.

## Catalizadores

| Catalyst | Timeline | Probability | Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------|--------|
| PFAS testing mandates ramp | 2026-2029 | High (70%) | +$300-500M revenue over 3-5 years |
| US infrastructure spending (IIJA water) | 2026-2028 | High (80%) | +2-3% WQ growth tailwind |
| Bolt-on M&A (water analytics) | 2026-2027 | High (70%) | +2-3% revenue, margin accretive |
| China recovery | 2027+ | Low (30%) | +1-2% total revenue |
| Multiple re-rating as spinoff discount fades | 2026-2027 | Medium (50%) | +10-15% price appreciation |

---

## Macro Fit

| Factor | Sensitivity | Impact on VLTO |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Interest rates | LOW | 0.5x leverage; minimal rate sensitivity |
| Recession | LOW | Water testing is mandated regardless of economy; PQI volumes may dip 5-10% |
| Inflation | POSITIVE | CPI-linked contracts; pricing power in both segments |
| USD strength | MODERATE | 55% international revenue; USD strength reduces translated revenue |
| Tariffs | LOW-MODERATE | Some PQI products affected; management expects drag to ease H2 2026 |

**World View Fit:** NEUTRAL-FAVORABLE. Defensive quality business with inflation protection. Water infrastructure spending is a bipartisan priority. Tariff exposure is manageable. Not dependent on rate cuts.

---

## Capital Allocation

| Priority | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Organic investment** | 1.0-1.5% capex/revenue (very low); R&D in connected water analytics, AI-powered testing |
| **Bolt-on M&A** | In-Situ (Jan 2026) first acquisition. $2B cash + low leverage = significant M&A capacity. DBS/VES M&A playbook proven at Danaher for decades |
| **Buybacks** | $750M program established Nov 2025. At current price, ~3.2% of market cap |
| **Dividends** | Increased 18%. Yield ~0.5%. Payout ratio 12%. Room to grow |

**Assessment:** Capital allocation is disciplined and shareholder-friendly. The bias toward bolt-on M&A using VES integration playbook is the right strategy for this type of business. Low payout ratio preserves M&A optionality.

- CEO Jennifer Honeycutt: NET SELLER (6 sells, 0 buys). Sales are via 10b5-1 plans (pre-planned).
- Multiple executives: routine selling via pre-arranged plans
- **Assessment:** NEUTRAL-NEGATIVE. No insider buying is a mild negative, but 10b5-1 plan sales in a recently-spun-off company where executives received shares at separation is normal, not alarming. Honeycutt still holds ~106K shares (~$10M+).

## Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| China slowdown persistent | 40% | LOW (6.4% of revenue) | Diversified geographically; LatAm growing 10% |
| Tariff escalation on PQI | 30% | MODERATE | Pricing power + supply chain adjustments |
| M&A integration risk (future deals) | 25% | MODERATE | VES playbook mitigates; In-Situ is small test case |
| Competition from Xylem/Endress in WQ | 20% | LOW | Switching costs protect installed base |
| Post-spinoff execution stumble | 15% | MODERATE | 2.5 years of clean execution so far |
| Regulatory deregulation (water testing) | 5% | HIGH | Extremely unlikely given PFAS + water crisis trends |
| CEO departure | 10% | MODERATE | Deep bench of Danaher alumni |

## Veredicto: WATCHLIST

**At $93, VLTO does NOT meet MoS requirements for Tier B (need ~20%, have 11.3%).**

**Entry target: $85** (19% MoS) — set standing order at this level after R2 (Devil's Advocate).

**Reasoning:**
1. QS 68 (Tier B upper) with strong case for natural QS improvement as more data accumulates
2. Wide moat confirmed by Morningstar, supported by 60% GM, 61% recurring revenue, regulatory mandates
3. PFAS optionality is a genuine free call option
4. VES/DBS heritage provides margin expansion + M&A compounding engine
5. But: low insider buying, slow organic growth (4-5%), and no immediate catalyst to compress price to entry
6. Precedent: Tier B positions require 20-25% MoS. At $85, we'd have 19% — acceptable given wide moat

**Next Steps:**
1. R2: Devil's Advocate to challenge thesis (especially growth projections and moat durability)
2. Monitor price for approach to $85 entry
3. Q1 FY2026 earnings (est. late April 2026) will validate FY2026 trajectory
4. Update quality_universe.yaml with FV $105 and entry $85

## 🔄 META-REFLECTION

### Incertidumbres/Dudas
- **ROIC data gap in tool:** The quality_scorer.py shows ROIC as "nan" for FY2025. This is because yfinance may not have complete income statement/balance sheet for the most recent fiscal year. The +16 adjustment relies heavily on pre-spinoff Danaher data for ROIC persistence — this is reasonable but introduces uncertainty.
- **DBS/VES transferability:** The assumption that VES (post-spinoff) will perform as well as DBS (at Danaher) is unproven at scale for M&A integration. In-Situ is the first test case.
- **Organic growth ceiling:** 4-5% organic growth may be the structural limit for these end markets. If so, the compounding thesis relies heavily on M&A execution — which adds risk.
- **Insider selling pattern:** Zero insider buying across the C-suite is mildly concerning. Even if 10b5-1 plans explain the selling, the ABSENCE of buying is notable.

### Sugerencias para el Sistema
- **quality_scorer.py spinoff handling:** The tool should have a flag like `--spinoff-years N` that uses parent company data for ROIC persistence when standalone history is insufficient. This would prevent systematic underscoring of recently-spun-off companies.
- **Dividend yield bug:** The tool shows 57.0% dividend yield for VLTO, which is clearly a data error from yfinance (actual yield is ~0.5%). This should be caught and flagged.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator
1. Should we fast-track R2 (Devil's Advocate) for VLTO given price is only 9.6% from entry?
2. The sector view has VLTO at QS 68 adj with +16 spinoff adjustment. Should we set a precedent that spinoff adjustments >10 points require committee approval (similar to serial acquirer protocol)?

### Anomalias Detectadas
- **Dividend yield 57.0% in both quality_scorer.py and price_checker.py** — This is clearly a yfinance data error. Actual VLTO dividend yield is approximately 0.5% ($0.36/share annual dividend / $93 price). This bug may affect other calculations.
- **ROIC showing as "nan"** for FY2025 despite Veralto having reported results — likely a yfinance data freshness issue for the most recent fiscal year.
