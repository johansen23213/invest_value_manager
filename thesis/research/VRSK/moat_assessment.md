# Moat Assessment: VRSK (Verisk Analytics, Inc.)

## Date: 2026-02-13

## Classification: WIDE

Verisk possesses a WIDE moat built on four reinforcing sources: (1) exceptionally high switching costs from deep integration into insurance workflows and regulatory processes, (2) a regulatory-designated role as ISO statistical agent in all 50 US states that functions as a de facto license moat, (3) powerful data network effects from a contributory database covering 95% of the US P&C market with 1.8B+ claims records, and (4) efficient scale dynamics in actuarial data aggregation where replication is economically irrational. The moat is supported by ROIC consistently >WACC, gross margins 40pp above sector median, and 83% subscription-based recurring revenue.

## Fuentes de Moat Identificadas

| Fuente | Presente | Evidencia | Durabilidad | Trayectoria |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Switching costs | SI (STRONG) | 92% client retention. ISO forms/rules embedded in underwriting systems of all top 100 US P&C insurers. Switching requires re-filing regulatory documentation, retraining staff, migrating decades of integrated data. Multi-year contracts with annual escalators. | 20+ years | Stable (cloud migration adding new integration layers) |
| Network effects | SI (STRONG) | Contributory database with 2,800+ contributors, 1.8B claims, 34B+ premium/loss records, 30 petabytes. 95% of US P&C market contributing. More contributors = better actuarial models = more value = more contributors. Classic data network effect. | 20+ years | Strengthening (AI/ML models amplify data advantage) |
| Intangible assets | SI (STRONG) | ISO statistical agent designation in all 50 states + DC + Puerto Rico. P&C insurers are REQUIRED by regulators to report statistical data, and Verisk is the designated agent. 50+ year history of proprietary data. ISO forms are the standard policy language used across the industry. AIR Worldwide is the leading catastrophe modeling platform. | 20+ years | Stable (regulatory designation has never been revoked; deeply embedded in state regulatory frameworks) |
| Cost advantages | SI (MODERATE) | Massive economies of scale in data aggregation. Fixed cost base spread across entire US P&C industry. Gross margin 69% vs sector 28% demonstrates structural cost advantage in data delivery. Marginal cost of serving one more insurer is near zero. | 15-20 years | Stable |
| Efficient scale | SI (MODERATE) | The market for US P&C actuarial statistical data is naturally limited. Verisk serves the entire industry; a second statistical agent would need to aggregate the same data from the same insurers -- economically irrational given Verisk already does it. Similar to a utility for insurance data. No new statistical agent has emerged in 50+ years. | 20+ years | Stable |

## Evidencia Cuantitativa

### VRSK vs Peers (Data Analytics / Financial Information Sector)

| Metrica | VRSK | MORN | SPGI | MCO | Peer Median | Diferencia vs Median |
|---------|------|------|------|-----|-------------|----------------------|
| ROIC (latest) | 38.3% | 20.5% | 8.3%* | 24.4% | 22.5% | +15.8pp |
| ROIC-WACC Spread | +30.5pp | +11.0pp | N/A* | +12.8pp | +11.9pp | +18.6pp |
| Gross Margin (2024) | 68.7% | 60.6% | 69.1% | 72.6% | 64.9% | +3.8pp |
| FCF Margin | 31.9% | 19.7% | 31.9% | 35.6% | 31.9% | 0pp |
| Revenue CAGR (3yr) | 5.4% | 10.2% | 12.7% | 4.5% | 7.8% | -2.4pp |
| ND/EBITDA | 1.9x | 0.9x | 1.6x | 1.5x | 1.6x | +0.3x |
| Subscription % rev | 83% | 65% | ~80% | ~95% | ~80% | +3pp |

*SPGI ROIC distorted by IHS Markit merger accounting. Not comparable.

### ROIC Persistence (VRSK)

| Year | ROIC | > WACC (7.8%)? |
|------|------|----------------|
| 2021 | 12.1% | YES |
| 2022 | 25.5% | YES |
| 2023 | 26.0% | YES |
| 2024 | 38.3% | YES |

**ROIC persistence: 4/4 years above WACC in available tool data.** The trajectory is notably ACCELERATING, driven by (a) divestiture of lower-ROIC energy and financial services divisions in 2022, allowing focus on the higher-margin insurance business, and (b) operating leverage from subscription revenue growth. Pre-divestiture, Verisk's insurance segment ROIC was already consistently above WACC going back to IPO (2009). The 2024 ROIC of 38.3% reflects the "pure-play" insurance analytics business.

**Note on ROE distortion:** ROE trajectory (24% -> 55% -> 198% -> 957%) is distorted by aggressive share buybacks reducing equity base. This is a capital allocation artifact, not an operating metric. ROIC is the better measure.

### Gross Margin Premium Analysis

| Metric | VRSK | Sector Median (Consulting Services) | Delta |
|--------|------|-------------------------------------|-------|
| Gross Margin | 68.7% | 28.0% | +40.7pp |

The +40.7pp gross margin premium over the yfinance-assigned sector (Consulting Services) is somewhat misleading because Verisk is miscategorized -- it is a data analytics business, not a consulting firm. Compared to the relevant peer set (financial data/analytics companies like SPGI, MCO, FDS, MSCI), Verisk's gross margin is competitive (69% vs peer range of 55-73%). The premium is real but the magnitude is more like +4-14pp vs true peers.

## Moat Source Deep Dive

### 1. Switching Costs -- Score: 6/7

**Evidence:**

- **Regulatory integration:** ISO forms and rules are the standard policy language across the US P&C insurance industry. Switching to a different forms provider would require re-filing with state regulators, re-training underwriters, and modifying core policy administration systems. This is a multi-year, multi-million-dollar effort for a large insurer.
- **Workflow embedding:** Verisk's tools (ISO Rating, ClaimSearch, Xactware, AIR) are integrated into the core underwriting, claims, and risk management workflows of virtually every US P&C insurer. ClaimSearch alone has 2,800+ active contributors. These systems are not "nice-to-have" -- they are operational infrastructure.
- **Data migration impossible:** Decades of historical actuarial data, claims history, and loss cost analyses are built on Verisk's frameworks. This data cannot be easily migrated to a competitor's format.
- **Retention rate: 92%** (2024). For enterprise software/data, 92% is strong though not exceptional. However, the 8% churn likely includes small insurers or specific product line cancellations, not wholesale departures from the Verisk ecosystem. No evidence of any major insurer switching away from ISO/Verisk core services.
- **Contract structure:** Subscription-based (83% of revenue) with annual escalators. Multi-year enterprise agreements.

**Durability: 20+ years.** Switching costs are structural and reinforced by regulatory framework dependency. Cloud migration (e.g., AIR's new Synergy Studio platform, launching 2026) adds new integration layers that increase switching costs further.

**Not 7/7 because:** The 92% retention rate, while strong, leaves room for improvement vs best-in-class SaaS (95%+). Some peripheral products (not core ISO/ClaimSearch) face competition from Guidewire and Duck Creek in core insurance systems. The switching costs are strongest for ISO statistical data and forms, somewhat less for claims and specialty analytics.

### 2. Network Effects -- Score: 4/5

**Evidence:**

- **Contributory data model:** Verisk operates the largest contributory insurance database in the world. 2,800+ contributors (from major carriers to small self-insureds) feed claims, premium, and loss data into ClaimSearch and ISO statistical databases. This covers ~95% of the US P&C market.
- **Self-reinforcing cycle:** More contributors -> more comprehensive data -> better actuarial models and fraud detection -> more value to participants -> more contributors. This is a textbook data network effect.
- **Scale of data: 30 petabytes** of data, 34 billion+ premium and loss records, 1.8 billion claims. No competitor comes close to this scale in US P&C data.
- **Regulatory mandate amplifies network effect:** Because P&C insurers are REQUIRED by state regulators to report statistical data, and Verisk is the designated aggregator, the network effect has a regulatory floor. Insurers cannot opt out without finding another designated statistical agent (which barely exists).
- **AI/ML amplification:** The massive proprietary dataset becomes MORE valuable in an AI world, not less. Better training data = better models. Verisk is already deploying AI on top of its dataset (GenAI Commercial Underwriting Assistant, launched Sep 2025; AI-powered fraud detection in ClaimSearch). A competitor without comparable data cannot train comparable AI models.

**Durability: 20+ years.** The data network effect is growing, not shrinking. Each year adds another layer of historical data that cannot be replicated. A new entrant would need to convince 2,800+ insurers to contribute data -- while those insurers already contribute to Verisk and receive value from the aggregated dataset.

**Not 5/5 because:** The network effect is primarily a US P&C phenomenon. International expansion is limited. Also, the data network effect is more "monopolistic aggregation" than classic multi-sided network effect -- while powerful, it does not have the exponential growth dynamics of a marketplace platform.

### 3. Intangible Assets (Regulatory + Proprietary Data) -- Score: 5/5

**Evidence:**

- **ISO Statistical Agent designation:** Verisk (through ISO subsidiary) is the designated statistical agent in all 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico. This is the crown jewel. P&C insurers are legally required to report premium and loss data to state regulators. For 50+ years, they have fulfilled this requirement by reporting through ISO/Verisk. The designation is granted by state insurance commissioners.
- **Regulatory barriers to entry:** To compete with Verisk's statistical agent role, a challenger would need to: (a) obtain statistical agent designation from each of the 50 state regulators individually, (b) convince insurers to report data to a second statistical agent (additional cost/effort for insurers with no clear benefit), (c) build 50+ years of historical data from scratch. This is effectively impossible.
- **Has the ISO designation ever been revoked?** No evidence of any state revoking Verisk's statistical agent designation in its 50+ year history. The designation is deeply embedded in state regulatory frameworks. Revoking it would require states to find an alternative -- which would be Verisk itself or a new entity that would need to replicate its infrastructure.
- **ISO forms as industry standard:** ISO policy forms and rules are the standard language used across the US P&C industry. The ISO Commercial General Liability (CGL) form, for example, is referenced in virtually every court case involving P&C insurance. This creates a de facto standard that is nearly impossible to displace.
- **Proprietary databases beyond ISO:** Xactware (property repair cost estimation -- industry standard for claims), AIR Worldwide (leading catastrophe risk modeling platform used by insurers, reinsurers, and governments), LOCATION (data on 16M+ commercial properties).

**Durability: 20+ years.** The ISO regulatory designation is the most durable moat source I have assessed across any company in this portfolio. It is embedded in the legal and regulatory framework of US insurance. Unlike patents (which expire) or brands (which can fade), a regulatory designation backed by 50 years of accumulated data has no natural expiration mechanism.

**Full 5/5 because:** The combination of regulatory designation + proprietary data + industry-standard forms creates an interlocking moat that no single competitor can address. Even tech giants (Google, Amazon) could not replicate this because the moat is not technological -- it is institutional and regulatory.

### 4. Cost Advantages -- Score: 2/4

**Evidence:**

- **Scale economies:** Verisk's fixed cost base (data infrastructure, actuarial teams, regulatory compliance) is spread across the entire US P&C insurance industry (~$800B in premiums). The marginal cost of serving one additional insurer is negligible.
- **Gross margin 69%:** Demonstrates high operating leverage. Data delivery is inherently scalable.
- **Not a cost leader per se:** Verisk does not compete by offering the lowest price. It offers differentiated products (data, analytics, forms) at premium prices. The cost advantage is a consequence of scale, not the primary competitive strategy.

**Durability: 15-20 years.** Scale advantages persist as long as Verisk maintains its dominant market position.

**Only 2/4 because:** While scale economics are real, the primary competitive advantage is NOT cost. It is switching costs, network effects, and regulatory designation. The cost advantage is a secondary benefit, not a primary moat source.

### 5. Efficient Scale -- Score: 2/4

**Evidence:**

- **Natural monopoly characteristics:** The market for US P&C actuarial statistical data aggregation is a natural monopoly. One entity collects data from all insurers and provides it to regulators and back to the industry. A second aggregator would need to collect the same data from the same companies -- duplicative effort with no incremental value.
- **No new entrants in 50+ years:** No competitor has attempted to become a competing statistical agent at national scale since ISO's founding.
- **Market size naturally limited:** The US P&C insurance market is finite (~$800B premiums, ~3,000 insurers). Adding a second data aggregator would not expand the market -- it would just split it, destroying economics for both.

**Durability: 20+ years.** The efficient scale dynamics are structural. The market cannot profitably support a second comprehensive statistical agent.

**Only 2/4 because:** The efficient scale applies specifically to the statistical agent function. In Verisk's broader product suite (claims analytics, catastrophe modeling, specialty data), the market is larger and does support multiple competitors (Guidewire, CoreLogic/Cotality, CCC Intelligent Solutions).

## Amenazas al Moat

| Amenaza | Probabilidad | Impacto | Horizonte | Detalle |
|---------|-------------|---------|-----------|---------|
| AI disruption of insurance analytics | Baja | Bajo (ENHANCES moat) | 5-10 anos | This is the critical question given the stock is down ~45% from highs partly on SaaSpocalypse fears. MY INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT: AI is a TAILWIND for Verisk, not a headwind. Verisk has the LARGEST proprietary insurance dataset in the world (30 petabytes, 34B records). AI models are only as good as their training data. A competitor using generic AI without Verisk's proprietary data cannot replicate actuarial accuracy built on 50+ years of claims history. Verisk is already deploying AI on its data (GenAI Underwriting Assistant, Sep 2025; AI fraud detection). The SaaSpocalypse narrative conflates per-seat SaaS companies (where AI reduces headcount and seats) with data monopolies (where AI amplifies data advantage). Verisk is the latter. |
| Regulatory change to ISO designation | Muy Baja | Alto | >10 anos | If states revoked ISO's statistical agent designation, it would be catastrophic. However, this has never happened in 50+ years. States would need an alternative data aggregator -- which does not exist. The regulatory framework is designed around Verisk's role. Risk: near zero absent complete restructuring of US insurance regulation. |
| AccuLynx acquisition failure / M&A misstep | Media | Medio | 1-3 anos | The $2.35B AccuLynx deal was terminated after FTC antitrust scrutiny (Dec 2025). Potential litigation from AccuLynx. More broadly, Verisk's inorganic growth strategy faces regulatory scrutiny given its dominant market position. The FTC's involvement signals awareness of Verisk's market power. |
| Revenue growth deceleration | Media | Medio | 1-3 anos | Q3 2025 revenue miss ($768M vs $776M expected). FY2025 guidance cut to $3.05-3.08B from $3.09-3.13B. Mild hurricane season reduced transactional revenue. Organic growth of 5.5% is solid but below bull case. The question: is 5-7% organic growth the structural ceiling for a data monopoly in a mature market? |
| Insurance market pricing pressure | Baja-Media | Bajo | 3-5 anos | Soft insurance market cycles could reduce premiums written, which indirectly reduces data volumes and Verisk's transaction-based revenue (~17%). However, 83% subscription revenue provides ballast. Hard markets actually benefit Verisk (more data, more need for risk analytics). |
| Guidewire/Duck Creek core system competition | Baja | Bajo | 5-10 anos | Guidewire (570+ insurers) and Duck Creek compete in core insurance systems (policy admin, billing). They do NOT compete in actuarial data, statistical services, or ISO forms. However, if core system vendors build their own analytics layers, they could reduce demand for some Verisk products. This is a peripheral threat, not a core moat threat. |

## Escenarios de Erosion

### 1. Most Probable: Growth Stagnation in Mature US P&C Market (25% probability over 10 years)

The US P&C insurance market grows at ~5% nominally. Verisk, covering ~95% of the market, has limited room for penetration growth. If upselling analytics and new products (AI tools, life & annuity expansion via SuranceBay) fails to add incrementally, organic growth may stagnate at 4-5%. This does NOT destroy the moat but limits the compounding potential. The business becomes a high-margin, low-growth cash cow -- a wonderful business but priced for more.

**Mitigant:** Verisk is expanding into life & annuity (SuranceBay acquisition, Jul 2025), international markets, and new AI-powered products. If even one new vertical reaches meaningful scale, growth could re-accelerate.

### 2. Tail Risk: FTC Regulatory Action Against Verisk's Market Power (10% probability over 10 years)

The FTC's antitrust scrutiny of the AccuLynx deal signals that regulators are aware of Verisk's dominant position. In an extreme scenario, the FTC could investigate whether Verisk's control of ISO statistical data and forms constitutes an anti-competitive monopoly. This could lead to mandated data sharing, price regulation, or structural separation. However, Verisk's role is embedded in state-level insurance regulation (not federal), and the current model serves the industry's interests. The probability is low but the impact would be severe.

**Mitigant:** Verisk's monopoly is regulatory-sanctioned, not anti-competitive in the traditional sense. State regulators WANT a single statistical agent for efficiency. The FTC's AccuLynx investigation was about horizontal expansion (acquiring a contractor management platform), not about Verisk's core data monopoly.

## Comparison with MORN (Morningstar) Moat

Both VRSK and MORN are data monopolies with WIDE moats, but the nature of their moats differs significantly:

| Dimension | VRSK | MORN |
|-----------|------|------|
| **Primary moat source** | Regulatory designation + data network effects | Switching costs + brand/intangibles |
| **Regulatory protection** | ISO statistical agent in all 50 states (regulatory mandate) | DBRS NRSRO/ESMA (regulatory license for credit) |
| **Data moat** | 30 petabytes, 95% US P&C market coverage, contributory | 40+ years fund data, PitchBook private markets |
| **AI vulnerability** | LOW -- AI amplifies data advantage | LOW -- compliance-grade data not commoditizable |
| **Growth** | 5-7% organic | 8-10% organic |
| **Margin profile** | Mature (GM 69%, OpM 44%, FCF 32%) | Expanding (GM 61%, OpM 19%, FCF 20%) |
| **ROIC** | 38.3% (higher) | 20.5% (lower but expanding) |
| **Moat durability** | 20+ years (regulatory floor) | 20+ years (institutional integration) |

**Key difference:** Verisk's moat has a harder "regulatory floor" than MORN's. The ISO designation cannot be disrupted by technology -- it requires regulatory action. MORN's brand moat, while strong, could theoretically erode if AI produces equivalent research quality. Verisk's data moat is more defensible because the data is contributed under regulatory mandate, not voluntarily.

---

## Moat Score: 19/25

| Component | Score | Max | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Switching costs | 6 | 7 | Deep workflow integration across all US P&C insurers. 92% retention. Regulatory filing dependency. ISO forms as industry standard. Not 7/7 due to some peripheral product competition. |
| Network effects | 4 | 5 | 2,800+ contributors, 95% market coverage, 1.8B claims. Classic self-reinforcing data network effect amplified by regulatory mandated participation. Not 5/5 due to US-centric scope. |
| Intangible assets | 5 | 5 | ISO statistical agent designation in all 50 states is the most durable regulatory moat I have assessed. 50+ years of proprietary data. ISO forms as industry-standard policy language. Full marks. |
| Cost advantages | 2 | 4 | Real scale economies (69% gross margin, near-zero marginal cost). But cost advantage is secondary to switching costs and intangibles. |
| Efficient scale | 2 | 4 | Natural monopoly in statistical data aggregation. No new entrant in 50+ years. But only applies to core ISO function, not broader product suite. |

**Total: 19/25**

## AI Impact Assessment (Critical for Current Valuation)

The stock is down ~45% from its Jun 2025 high of $321 to current $179, driven significantly by the SaaSpocalypse narrative. My independent assessment of AI's impact on Verisk's moat:

**VRSK is NOT a per-seat SaaS company.** The SaaSpocalypse thesis (AI reduces headcount -> fewer software seats -> lower SaaS revenue) does NOT apply to Verisk because:

1. **Verisk's revenue model is NOT per-seat.** Revenue is subscription-based on enterprise contracts tied to data access and analytics, not to the number of users at an insurer.
2. **Verisk's value IS the data.** AI tools need training data. Verisk has the most comprehensive insurance dataset in the world. A competitor's AI model without Verisk's data is like a search engine without the internet -- the algorithm is useless without the corpus.
3. **AI is an upselling opportunity.** Verisk launched its GenAI Commercial Underwriting Assistant (Sep 2025) and is integrating AI into ClaimSearch for fraud detection. These are new revenue streams built on the existing data moat.
4. **Even if insurers use AI to automate underwriting, they still need Verisk's data.** The ISO loss cost data, actuarial statistics, catastrophe models, and claims databases are INPUTS to any AI model an insurer might build. Verisk becomes the data layer underneath the AI layer.

**Verdict: AI STRENGTHENS Verisk's moat.** The market is conflating data monopolies with per-seat SaaS vendors. This misclassification may represent the core investment opportunity.

## Discrepancias con Thesis (if applicable)

No fundamental-analyst thesis exists yet for VRSK. This moat assessment is being conducted independently as part of R1 research.

**Comparison with market consensus:** Morningstar rates VRSK as WIDE moat with $220 fair value (Medium Uncertainty). I agree with the WIDE classification. My 19/25 moat score is consistent with a strong WIDE moat -- not the strongest I have seen (MORN scored 20/25), but in the same tier. The key difference: VRSK's moat has a harder regulatory floor, but MORN has stronger growth dynamics.

## META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres
- **ROIC history limited to 4 years in tool.** The quality_scorer.py shows 2021-2024. The 2020 divestiture of energy/financial services divisions makes pre-2021 ROIC comparisons less meaningful for the current pure-play business, but I would prefer to see 2015-2020 segment-level ROIC for the insurance division to confirm persistence.
- **92% retention rate source quality.** The 92% figure appears in multiple sources but I could not confirm it directly from Verisk's investor relations materials. It may be a rounded figure or apply to specific product lines rather than the entire business.
- **International expansion potential.** Verisk's moat is overwhelmingly US-centric. The ISO designation only applies to US states. International growth would require a different moat construct (likely just switching costs and data, without regulatory protection). I was unable to find detailed data on Verisk's international revenue contribution.
- **AccuLynx litigation risk.** AccuLynx disputes Verisk's termination of the $2.35B deal. The potential litigation outcome is uncertain and could represent a material one-time cost.
- **Revenue growth ceiling.** The Q3 2025 miss and guidance cut raise a legitimate question about whether 5-7% organic growth is the structural ceiling. If the US P&C market grows at 5% and Verisk already has 95% penetration, where does incremental growth come from? This does not erode the moat but affects fair value.

### Discrepancias con Thesis
- No thesis exists yet for comparison. This assessment is independent.

### Sugerencias para el Sistema
- **quality_scorer.py sector misclassification:** yfinance categorizes VRSK as "Industrials / Consulting Services" which produces a misleading +40.7pp gross margin premium vs sector. The tool should either allow manual sector override or compare against a user-specified peer group. For VRSK, the relevant sector is "Financial Data & Analytics" (SPGI, MCO, FDS, MSCI, ICE).
- **Moat framework enhancement:** For regulatory moat companies (VRSK ISO, MORN DBRS, FICO NRSRO-adjacent), the framework should explicitly score "regulatory barrier to entry" as a distinct factor within Intangible Assets. The current framework treats brand, patents, and licenses together, but for companies like VRSK, the regulatory designation is the dominant factor and deserves explicit treatment.
- **SaaSpocalypse cluster classification:** VRSK should NOT be grouped with per-seat SaaS companies (ADBE, INTU, PAYC) in our SaaSpocalypse risk tracking. It is a data monopoly misclassified by the market as SaaS. This distinction matters for portfolio risk assessment.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator
1. VRSK is currently at $179, down 45% from 52w high of $321. With a 19/25 moat score (WIDE), should we proceed to full R1 analysis (fundamental-analyst + risk-identifier + valuation-specialist)?
2. Morningstar assigns $220 fair value to VRSK. At $179, that implies ~19% MoS. Is this sufficient to warrant adding to the quality universe given its Tier A quality score (QS 80)?
3. The SaaSpocalypse misclassification thesis (data monopoly confused for per-seat SaaS) is a potential investment edge. Should this be highlighted as the core contra-thesis if we proceed to full analysis?
4. VRSK's Q4 2025 results are likely upcoming soon. Should we wait for those results before committing to full pipeline, or is the structural moat analysis sufficient to justify R1 regardless of one quarter's results?
