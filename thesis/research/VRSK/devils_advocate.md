# Counter-Analysis: VRSK (Verisk Analytics, Inc.)

## Fecha: 2026-02-13

## Resumen Ejecutivo

The thesis survives on the core moat argument -- Verisk's ISO statistical agent designation is genuinely near-irreplaceable -- but the valuation framework is materially flawed. The fundamental-analyst's FV of $260 is indefensible: it relies on a discretionary $30 "monopoly premium" rounding, an optimistic FCF base ($1,116M TTM instead of $920M actual FY2024), and growth assumptions (7%) that do not incorporate the soft market cycle as a base case reality. The valuation specialist's $185 is far more credible but even this may be generous given a Reverse DCF at WACC 7.5% shows $179 prices in 10%+ growth -- well above any reasonable estimate. At $179, the stock is roughly fairly valued to slightly overvalued, not 31% undervalued. The QS adjustment from 80 to 85 (+5 for market position) is directionally correct but the quantum may overstate quality given 0.3% insider ownership, 100% single-vertical concentration, and an organic revenue growth ceiling of 5-6%. The failed AccuLynx litigation is an underappreciated risk. This is a STRONG COUNTER -- the thesis needs significant revision before R4.

**Severity Score: 13/19**

## Asunciones Clave Desafiadas

### 1. Fair Value of $260 Is Defensible

- **Evidencia en contra:** The analyst arrived at a $230 weighted average, then added $30 (13%) as a discretionary "monopoly premium." This is undisciplined valuation. The $230 weighted average itself was inflated by using TTM FCF of $1,116M instead of FY2024 actual of $920M (a 21% difference), and by assigning only 10% weight to the DCF which produced $163 -- the lowest and most conservative estimate. The valuation specialist independently arrived at $185, a 29% discrepancy. When the thesis says "round up from $230 to $260 to capture full monopoly moat value," this is exactly the kind of rationalization our adversarial review project has corrected in 5 consecutive positions. Every sell-side analyst (Goldman $239, Wells Fargo $237, RBC $250, Morningstar $220) is BELOW the thesis FV of $260. The thesis FV is the most optimistic estimate in the entire universe of published analysis.
- **Severidad:** **CRITICAL**
- **Resolucion sugerida:** Adopt the valuation specialist's $185 as base FV, or at most the weighted $205 (40% analyst / 60% specialist as stated in the thesis header). The $260 figure should be discarded entirely.

### 2. Revenue Growth of 7% Is a Base Case

- **Evidencia en contra:** Verisk's organic revenue CAGR over the past 3 years is 5.4%. Management's own 2025 guidance implies ~6% full-year growth. Q3 2025 organic growth was only 5.9%, decelerating from 7.0% in Q1 and 7.8% in Q2. The P&C insurance market is entering a confirmed soft cycle -- property cat reinsurance rates declined 14.7% at Jan 2026 renewals (largest since 2014). BMO Capital specifically identifies 20-25% of VRSK's revenue as NWP-linked, meaning tied to premium volumes that are now decelerating. Deloitte forecasts premium growth decelerating from 5% (2025) to 3-4% (2026). The thesis assigns 7% as BASE and 4% as BEAR, but the data suggests 5-6% is the realistic base and 3-4% is the soft market bear. The analyst credits +2-3% from pricing power and +1-2% from AI products; the valuation specialist rightly discounts these to +1.5% and +0.5% respectively. No evidence exists that AI product launches have generated material incremental revenue yet.
- **Severidad:** **HIGH**
- **Resolucion sugerida:** Use 6% (specialist estimate) as base case, with 4-5% as a plausible downside scenario given soft market. The 7% growth rate should be the optimistic case, not the base.

### 3. AI Is a Pure Tailwind for Verisk

- **Evidencia en contra:** The thesis asserting "AI is an INPUT to Verisk's models, not a threat" is directionally correct for the core ISO statistical data. However, it understates three legitimate risks: (a) AI enables alternative data sources -- satellite imagery, IoT sensors, social media data, and telematics can supplement or partially replace traditional actuarial data for SOME underwriting decisions. The insurance analytics market is projected to grow from $13.3B to $31.8B by 2031, and a significant portion of this growth will come from alternative data analytics providers, not just Verisk. (b) GenAI enables large insurers to build more sophisticated in-house analytics. While they still need Verisk's raw data, the VALUE-ADDED ANALYTICS layer (which commands higher margins) is where AI competition is real. Verisk's 130bps margin expansion from AI is real but defensive (process automation), not offensive (new revenue). (c) The SaaSpocalypse narrative, even if partially irrational, compresses valuation multiples for an extended period. The thesis dismisses this as temporary but provides no timeline for normalization. FactSet (FDS) has fallen 58% from 52wH -- sector-wide compression can persist for 12-24+ months.
- **Severidad:** **MODERATE**
- **Resolucion sugerida:** Acknowledge that AI is net positive for Verisk's core business but net UNCERTAIN for its analytics overlay products. The SaaSpocalypse multiple compression should be treated as a base case reality (12-18 month duration), not a bear case anomaly.

### 4. The QS Adjustment from 80 to 85 (+5) Is Justified

- **Evidencia en contra:** The +5 adjustment comes entirely from Market Position (0 to 8/8). While Verisk IS the dominant ISO statistical agent, the QS Tool-First protocol (Principle 5, Session 52) requires that adjustments >5 points have "quantitative evidence." The evidence provided IS strong for market position. However, the adjustment fails to account for two OFFSETTING negatives that should reduce the adjusted QS: (a) Insider ownership at 0.3% warrants 0/5 points -- the CEO sold $9.9M in shares last year and purchased ZERO. The 10b5-1 plan is a schedule, not a justification. Every prior Tier A entry had stronger insider alignment: BYIT.L 9.6%, MONY.L 10%+, AUTO.L founder family interests. (b) 100% single-vertical concentration post-divestitures is a quality REDUCTION that the QS framework does not capture. The thesis celebrates this as "focus" but the risk assessment correctly identifies it as HIGH risk. A QS of 80 (Tool) with a NET ZERO adjustment (market position +8, offset by concentration risk -3 to -5 and extreme insider weakness) is more defensible. Adjusted QS: 80, still Tier A, but not 85.
- **Severidad:** **MODERATE**
- **Resolucion sugerida:** Keep QS at 80 (Tool score). The market position adjustment is offset by single-vertical concentration risk and exceptionally weak insider alignment. Tier A is maintained at 80, but the 85 overstates quality.

### 5. The Bear Case ($175 thesis / $140 specialist) Provides Adequate Downside Protection

- **Evidencia en contra:** At $179, the stock is ABOVE the thesis bear case of $175. This means the current price already discounts a near-bear scenario. If anything moderately negative happens (further guidance cut, soft market deepening, FTC action), the stock has no valuation floor above the specialist's bear of $140 -- a further 22% downside from current. The MoS vs bear case is -2.3% (thesis) and -21.8% (specialist). For context, every Tier A precedent entry (ADBE, NVO, MONY.L, LULU, AUTO.L, BYIT.L) had MoS vs bear case that was POSITIVE -- meaning the price was below the bear case FV, providing genuine downside protection. VRSK at $179 provides ZERO downside protection vs either bear case estimate. This violates the spirit of "MoS vs Bear Case" in the valuation-methods skill.
- **Severidad:** **HIGH**
- **Resolucion sugerida:** The entry strategy of $150 (thesis) or $140 (specialist) is appropriate. At current $179, the stock should be WATCHLIST only with no standing order until post-earnings clarity on Feb 18.

## Desafios por Categoria

### Negocio

| # | Desafio | Evidencia | Severidad |
|---|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | 100% insurance concentration is celebrated as "focus" but is actually existential risk | Post-WoodMac, post-FinServ, post-Marketing Solutions divestitures, VRSK has ZERO revenue diversification. Any disruption to how P&C insurance uses data analytics hits 100% of revenue. The risk assessment correctly rates this HIGH. | HIGH |
| 2 | Organic revenue growth ceiling of 5-6% for a "premium valuation" stock | Historical 3yr CAGR 5.4%. 2025 guidance implies ~6%. The thesis claims 7% but offers no evidence this has been achieved on a sustained annual basis post-divestitures. EPS growth of 10-18% masks this through buybacks (financial engineering, not organic growth). | HIGH |
| 3 | The "monopoly" narrative overstates the breadth of the moat | The ISO statistical agent designation is genuinely near-irreplaceable for CORE actuarial data. But Verisk's claims business (Xactimate, ~30% rev) faces competition from CoreLogic/Cotality, CCC Intelligent Solutions, and emerging AI tools. The cat modeling business (AIR) faces Moody's RMS with aggressive cloud-native investment. The "monopoly" applies to maybe 40-50% of revenue (ISO statistical services), not 100%. | MODERATE |
| 4 | Failed AccuLynx deal signals FTC will block all M&A growth | The FTC issued a Second Request (only 3-4% of deals get this). AccuLynx is now suing Verisk, disputing the termination validity. This signals: (a) Verisk cannot grow by acquisition (its historical playbook), (b) there is active litigation risk (break-up fee, damages), (c) the FTC views Verisk's data dominance as a potential antitrust concern. | HIGH |
| 5 | CEO insider ownership of 0.3% is the weakest among all Tier A candidates | Lee Shavel sold 8,800 shares ($1.07M+) over the past year and purchased ZERO. His total holding of 76,707 shares ($13.7M at $179) is trivial for a $25B company CEO. No director purchases to offset. This is NOT "aligned." | MODERATE |

### Valoracion

| # | Desafio | Evidencia | Severidad |
|---|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Analyst FV of $260 includes undisciplined $30 "monopoly premium" rounding | Weighted average was $230. Analyst added $30 (13%) by "rounding up to capture monopoly moat value." This is exactly the pattern that our adversarial reviews have corrected in 5 consecutive positions. The "monopoly premium" has no quantitative basis. | CRITICAL |
| 2 | TTM FCF of $1,116M vs FY2024 actual of $920M -- 21% overstatement of base | The analyst uses TTM FCF which includes strong Q1-Q3 2025. But FY2024 actual was $920M. Using trailing periods that include recent peaks introduces recency bias. The specialist correctly uses FY2024 actual. | HIGH |
| 3 | Reverse DCF shows $179 prices in 8-10%+ growth at WACC 7.5% -- well above sustainable | At the analyst's own WACC of 7.5%, the current price implies approximately 8% growth for 5 years. This is above the historical CAGR of 5.4% and above even the optimistic 7% base case. The stock is not cheap on a cash flow basis. | HIGH |
| 4 | EV/EBITDA of 20x assumed "justified" but SaaSpocalypse compression may be structural, not temporary | The thesis assumes multiple recovery from 16x to 20x. But the SaaSpocalypse has compressed ALL data analytics peers: SPGI -31%, MCO -24%, FDS -58% from 52wH. If AI concerns persist for 12-24+ months, the 16x multiple may be the new normal, not a temporary dislocation. At 16x, the specialist's bear case of $140 applies. | MODERATE |
| 5 | Method divergence exceeds 30%: DCF $111-163 vs EV/EBITDA $216-246 | This 95% divergence within the specialist's own methods indicates extreme model uncertainty. The thesis resolves this by giving DCF only 10-15% weight, but this is a choice to favor the highest-producing method, not a principled resolution. | MODERATE |
| 6 | OEY + Growth of 9.6% is WELL BELOW all Tier A precedent entries (13-15.5%) | The valuation specialist correctly identifies this. At $179, VRSK's total return profile (3.6% OEY + 6% growth = 9.6%) is the worst of any Tier A candidate. ADBE: 14.5%, NVO: 15.5%, MONY.L: ~14%, LULU: ~14%, AUTO.L: ~13%, BYIT.L: 14.4%. VRSK does not offer comparable value at current prices. | HIGH |

### Riesgos

| # | Desafio | Evidencia | Severidad |
|---|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Driver data privacy litigation (Hyundai, GM) is active and material | Class actions filed against Verisk for receiving and selling driver behavior data from 1.7M Hyundai vehicles. FTC has already banned GM/OnStar from sharing such data for 5 years. Discovery is ongoing through late 2026. If FTC extends the ban to ALL data brokers receiving telematics data, Verisk loses a growth area. Financial exposure: $50-200M+ from settlements plus regulatory precedent. | MODERATE |
| 2 | AccuLynx counter-litigation: Verisk is both plaintiff and defendant | Verisk sued AccuLynx seeking declaratory judgment that termination was valid. AccuLynx disputes termination validity. If court rules Verisk improperly terminated, potential damages (break-up fee, lost profits) could be material -- potentially hundreds of millions. The thesis treats this as "one-time cost" but the outcome is uncertain. | MODERATE |
| 3 | P&C soft market cycle is ALREADY materializing, not a future risk | Property cat reinsurance rates -14.7% at Jan 2026 (largest decline since 2014). Industry premium growth decelerating from 5% to 3-4% (Deloitte). This directly hits 20-25% of Verisk's NWP-linked revenue. The soft market typically lasts 3-5 years. This should be BASE CASE, not bear case. | HIGH |
| 4 | The thesis minimizes Moody's RMS as a cat modeling competitor | Moody's acquired RMS and is investing in cloud-native Risk Modeler platform. Verisk's response (Synergy Studio, 2026 launch) is still forthcoming. Most major insurers already use BOTH AIR and RMS for regulatory compliance. If Moody's offers bundled pricing with credit ratings, cat modeling share could shift. Estimated 5-10% revenue risk over 5 years. | LOW |
| 5 | Kill conditions are too lenient -- "ROIC below 20% for 2 consecutive quarters" | ROIC is currently 38%. By the time it falls to 20%, catastrophic value has already been destroyed. A better kill condition would be "ROIC below 30% for 2 consecutive quarters" or "subscription revenue growth below 5% for 2 consecutive quarters." | LOW |

### Timing

| # | Desafio | Evidencia | Severidad |
|---|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Q4 2025 earnings are in 5 DAYS (Feb 18) -- why not wait? | The thesis itself recommends WATCHLIST and waiting for earnings. But the FV of $260 and the 31% MoS narrative create a false sense of urgency. At $179, there is NO rush. If earnings disappoint, the stock could easily drop to $150-160 (where the specialist says entry is appropriate). If earnings are strong, the thesis can be revised upward with confidence. Buying now has asymmetric risk to the downside. | HIGH |
| 2 | The SaaSpocalypse selloff may not have bottomed | VRSK hit $167 52-week low on Feb 12 -- just yesterday. The stock is in a confirmed downtrend from $323. Broader SaaS/data analytics sector remains under pressure. Catching a falling knife with inadequate MoS (3% vs specialist FV, -2% vs thesis bear) is imprudent. | MODERATE |
| 3 | Analyst consensus has shifted to HOLD (15 analysts), not BUY | 8 Buy, 6 Hold, 2 Sell. Rothschild has a SELL rating with $220 target. Wall Street Zen downgraded to SELL. Argus cut to HOLD. The balance of opinion is moving AGAINST the stock, not for it. | LOW |

## Conflictos con Otros Analisis

### Analyst ($260 FV) vs Valuation Specialist ($185 FV): 29% Divergence

This is the most significant conflict. The sources of divergence are systematic:

| Input | Analyst | Specialist | Impact |
|-------|---------|------------|--------|
| Revenue growth | 7% | 6% | -$15-20 |
| EV/EBITDA multiple | 20x | 18x | -$20-25 |
| FCF base | $1,116M TTM | $920M FY2024 | -$15-20 |
| Monopoly premium | +$30 discretionary | $0 | -$30 |
| **Total FV** | **$260** | **$185** | **-$75** |

The thesis header states "R3: analyst $260, specialist $185, weighted 40/60" = $215. But neither this weighted figure nor the specialist's $185 aligns with the QS adjustment or entry strategy. The thesis should use $205 (the R3 weighted figure) as FV consistently.

### Risk Assessment (MEDIUM) vs Thesis Tone (Bullish)

The risk assessment identifies 3 HIGH risks (concentration, soft market, AI narrative) and explicitly states it would UPGRADE to HIGH if Q4 2025 shows subscription growth below 7%. The thesis tone is much more bullish, treating the moat as near-impervious. The risk assessment's nuance is not reflected in the thesis narrative.

### Moat Assessment (19/25) -- Generally Aligned but with Caveats

The moat assessment is the strongest part of the R1 analysis. The 19/25 score is well-supported. However, the moat assessor correctly notes:
- 92% retention rate is strong but not exceptional vs best-in-class SaaS (95%+)
- The monopoly applies primarily to ISO statistical services, not the full product suite
- International expansion potential is limited because the ISO designation is US-only
- The $40.7pp gross margin premium vs sector is misleading due to VRSK being miscategorized as "Consulting Services" -- vs true peers (SPGI, MCO), the premium is only +4-14pp

## Veredicto Global

| Metric | Valor |
|--------|-------|
| Desafios HIGH/CRITICAL | **7** de 18 |
| Desafios no resueltos por thesis | **6** (FV inflation, growth overestimate, bear MoS, OEY gap vs precedents, soft market in base case, AccuLynx litigation) |
| Veredicto | **STRONG COUNTER** |
| Severity Score | **13/19** |

### Interpretacion:

**STRONG COUNTER:** The thesis has a sound core (the moat is genuinely wide, the business is high-quality) but the valuation framework is materially flawed. The fundamental-analyst's $260 FV is the most optimistic estimate in the entire published universe. The specialist's $185 is more defensible but even this gives only 3.2% MoS at $179 -- far below any Tier A precedent entry. The OEY + Growth spread of 9.6% is the weakest of any Tier A candidate evaluated.

**This is NOT a bad business. It is a GREAT business at a price that does not yet offer compelling value for a Tier A entry.**

### Score Breakdown (13/19):

| Challenge | Points | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| FV of $260 is undisciplined (CRITICAL) | 3/3 | $30 discretionary premium, TTM FCF overstatement, highest FV in published universe |
| Growth of 7% not defensible as base (HIGH) | 2/3 | Soft market, historical 5.4% CAGR, management guidance ~6% |
| Bear case MoS is negative (HIGH) | 2/3 | At $179, no downside protection vs any bear scenario |
| OEY + Growth well below Tier A precedents (HIGH) | 2/3 | 9.6% vs 13-15.5% for all prior entries |
| 100% concentration post-divestitures (HIGH) | 1/3 | Genuine risk but offset by moat quality |
| Soft market as base case reality (HIGH) | 1/3 | Already materializing, not hypothetical |
| AI thesis partially overstated (MODERATE) | 1/3 | Core ISO data protected; analytics overlay less so |
| QS 85 adjustment overstated (MODERATE) | 1/3 | Market position correct but offset by negatives |

## Recomendacion al Investment Committee

1. **REJECT the $260 FV.** Adopt $205 (R3 weighted: 40% analyst $260 / 60% specialist $185) or preferably $185 (specialist standalone) as the working FV.

2. **DO NOT set a standing order at current prices.** At $179, MoS is 3-12% depending on FV used -- far below Tier A precedents of 29-38%.

3. **WAIT for Q4 2025 earnings (Feb 18).** This is 5 days away. The data will clarify:
   - Is subscription growth accelerating (>8%) or decelerating (<6%)?
   - What is 2026 guidance? ($3.20B+ = bullish; <$3.15B = bearish)
   - Any commentary on FTC/AccuLynx litigation?

4. **Appropriate entry price is $130-150** based on:
   - $140 provides 24% MoS vs specialist $185 (consistent with Tier A precedents)
   - $140 provides MoS vs the specialist bear case of $140 (breakeven downside protection)
   - $130-140 brings OEY + Growth to ~11-12% (closer to, though still below, Tier A precedents)

5. **Resolve the QS before R4.** The committee should evaluate whether 80 (Tool) or 85 (adjusted) is the correct score, given offsetting factors of market position (+8) vs concentration risk and insider weakness.

6. **Add a SaaSpocalypse-specific kill condition.** If EV/EBITDA multiple compresses below 14x (vs current ~16x) for more than 6 months without fundamental deterioration, this signals structural multiple re-rating, not temporary dislocation. The thesis assumes recovery to 20x but provides no timeline or trigger.

## META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres
- The Q4 2025 earnings on Feb 18 are critical and I cannot evaluate them. My analysis is pre-earnings, which limits my ability to assess whether the growth deceleration is temporary (weather) or structural (soft market). If subscription growth comes in at 9%+ with strong 2026 guidance, several of my challenges become weaker.
- The AccuLynx litigation outcome is genuinely uncertain. I could not find court filings or scheduling information to assess the timeline or probability of adverse outcomes.
- The precise percentage of VRSK revenue that is NWP-linked (BMO says 20-25%) is not explicitly disclosed by Verisk. If the actual figure is lower (e.g., 15%), the soft market risk is less severe than I estimated.
- I may be overly influenced by the system's adversarial review pattern (5 consecutive FV cuts). While this pattern suggests analyst estimates tend to be inflated, VRSK's moat IS genuinely stronger than most prior targets (MORN, ROP). The question is whether moat strength justifies a higher FV or just lower risk.

### Limitaciones de Este Analisis
- No Q4 2025 earnings data available (announcement is Feb 18)
- Could not access Verisk's 10-K directly for precise revenue breakdown by contract type (subscription vs NWP-linked vs transactional)
- Could not find AccuLynx litigation court documents to assess timeline and exposure
- Did not run dcf_calculator.py or quality_scorer.py independently (relied on thesis-provided outputs)
- Moody's RMS competitive dynamics are difficult to assess from public sources -- the competitive threat may be larger or smaller than my estimate

### Sugerencias para el Sistema
- **FV discipline protocol needed:** The analyst jumped from $230 weighted to $260 by adding a subjective monopoly premium. The system should have a rule: "No discretionary adjustments >5% of weighted FV without explicit committee approval." This would have flagged the $30 addition (13%).
- **Pre-earnings gate for standing orders:** The thesis recommends a $150 standing order while Q4 earnings are 5 days away. Standing orders should be PAUSED within 7 days of earnings until results are processed.
- **OEY + Growth minimum for Tier A entries:** The pattern is clear -- all prior Tier A entries had OEY + Growth of 13%+. VRSK at 9.6% is structurally different (lower growth). Either (a) VRSK requires a deeper discount to compensate, or (b) the system should distinguish "low-growth monopolies" from "high-growth compounders" in the Tier A framework.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator
1. Given the 29% divergence between analyst ($260) and specialist ($185), which FV should the system use for the quality_universe entry? My recommendation: $185 (specialist), with $205 R3 as an alternative.
2. Should the Feb 18 earnings be a hard gate before proceeding to R4, or should the committee evaluate based on pre-earnings data? My recommendation: HARD GATE -- wait 5 days for material data.
3. The OEY + Growth of 9.6% is below all Tier A precedents. Does this mean VRSK needs a structurally different entry threshold (e.g., OEY + Growth of 10-11% is acceptable for monopoly-grade businesses with 20+ year moat duration)? Or does it mean VRSK simply needs to fall further before entry?
4. Should the system track "discretionary FV adjustments" as a separate metric in the adversarial review? The $30 monopoly premium added by the analyst is a pattern risk.
