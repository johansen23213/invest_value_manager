## 1. POSITION SNAPSHOT (Research Pipeline)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current Price | ~$179 (Feb 13) |
| QS Tool | 80/100 (Tier A) |
| QS Adjusted | 80/100 (Tier A) — DA rejected +5 adj |
| R3 FV | $185 |
| Entry Target | $135-140 (23-27% MoS) |
| Distance to Entry | 22-25% above |
| Pipeline | R3 COMPLETE, R4 PENDING (this earnings = hard gate) |
| 52-Week High/Low | $323 / $168 |

**KEY CONTEXT:** VRSK R3 FV is $185. At $179, the stock is only 3.3% below FV — effectively FAIRLY VALUED. The DA (13/19 STRONG COUNTER) identified $30 monopoly premium as indefensible, growth ceiling at 5-6%, and OEY+Growth 9.6% as the LOWEST of all Tier A candidates. Entry requires significant pullback to $135-140.

## 2. WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW

### Q3 2025 Results (Oct 2025)
| Metric | Q3 2025 | Q3 2024 | Change |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| Revenue | ~$770M | ~$720M | +6.9% |
| Organic Growth | 5.9% | — | Decelerating (Q1: 7.0%, Q2: 7.8%) |
| EBITDA Margin | ~55% | ~54% | Expanding |
| EPS (adj) | ~$1.58 | ~$1.48 | +7% |
| Subscription Rev Growth | +8.5% | — | Decelerating from 10.6% Q1 |

### FY2025 Full-Year Guidance (reaffirmed Q3)
| Metric | Low | High |
|--------|-----|------|
| Revenue | $3.05B | $3.08B |
| EBITDA | $1.69B | $1.72B |
| EBITDA Margin | 55.0% | 55.8% |

### Consensus for Q4 2025
| Metric | Consensus | Context |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Revenue | ~$775-790M | Implied from full-year guide minus Q1-Q3 |
| EPS (adj) | ~$1.58 | Per analyst consensus (-1.9% YoY from $1.61) |
| EBITDA Margin | ~55-56% | In-line with guidance |

**Note:** Q4 is typically the strongest quarter (claims activity seasonality). The deceleration trend (Q1 7.0% → Q2 7.8% → Q3 5.9%) is the key pattern. Q4 organic growth will confirm or deny this deceleration narrative.

## 3. SCENARIOS

### BEAR (20% probability)
**Triggers:** Q4 organic growth <5%, FY2026 guide below consensus, AccuLynx litigation escalation, soft market commentary worse than expected
| Metric | Bear Case |
|--------|-----------|
| Revenue | <$770M (<5% organic) |
| EPS | <$1.50 |
| FY2026 guide | Revenue growth <5%, EBITDA margin flat or declining |
| Soft market | Management flags NWP-linked deceleration as structural |
| AccuLynx | FTC or counter-litigation update negative |
| Stock reaction | -10-15% to $150-165 range |

**MY ACTION IF BEAR:**
- Stock at $150-165 = APPROACHING entry range ($135-140)
- IF guidance cut is structural + soft market acknowledged: FV may need further reduction below $185
- IF just temporary softness: maintain FV $185, entry $135-140 still valid
- DECISION: Wait 48h post-earnings, evaluate if $150 is reached, then fast-track R4

### BASE (55% probability)
**Triggers:** Q4 in-line, guidance maintained, organic growth 5.5-7%, margin stable
| Metric | Base Case |
|--------|-----------|
| Revenue | $775-795M (+5.5-7% organic) |
| EPS | $1.55-1.65 |
| FY2026 guide | Revenue $3.2-3.3B (+5-7%), EBITDA margin 55-56% |
| Subscription growth | +7-9% (steady) |
| AI commentary | Qualitative (no quantified revenue) |
| Stock reaction | +/-5% ($170-190 range) |

**MY ACTION IF BASE:**
- Stock stays $170-190 = ABOVE entry range
- CONTINUE MONITORING, no action
- FV $185 confirmed
- Entry remains $135-140 (wait for correction catalyst)

### BULL (25% probability)
**Triggers:** Q4 beat, FY2026 guide raised, AI revenue quantified, soft market navigated
| Metric | Bull Case |
|--------|-----------|
| Revenue | >$800M (+8%+) |
| EPS | >$1.70 |
| FY2026 guide | Revenue growth 7-8%, margin expansion to 56-57% |
| AI products | Quantified incremental revenue ($50M+ from Synergy Studio) |
| Buybacks | Accelerated (>$500M Q4) |
| Stock reaction | +10-15% to $195-210 |

**MY ACTION IF BULL:**
- Stock moves AWAY from entry = NO ACTION
- If rally sustained to $200+, entry target needs revision upward to $150-160
- Monitor if soft market data contradicts bullish guidance (disconnect = risk)

## 4. WHAT TO WATCH (Priority Order)

1. **Organic revenue growth rate** — Most critical. >6% = deceleration narrative weakened. <5% = confirms DA's growth ceiling thesis.
2. **FY2026 revenue and EBITDA guidance** — First formal guidance for 2026. Will reveal how management sees soft market impact.
3. **Subscription revenue growth** — Was 10.6% Q1 → decelerating. >8% = healthy. <7% = concern.
4. **Soft market commentary** — Any quantification of NWP-linked revenue impact from -14.7% reinsurance rate declines.
5. **EBITDA margin trajectory** — 55-56% guidance. Expansion confirms operating leverage. Contraction = risk.
6. **AccuLynx litigation update** — Any settlement or FTC update.
7. **AI/Synergy Studio launch timeline** — Q3 2025 said 2026 launch. Any quantified revenue?
8. **Buyback activity** — Rate and magnitude. Aggressive = management confidence.
9. **Capital allocation priorities** — M&A appetite post-AccuLynx block? Or pure organic + buybacks?
10. **Transaction/event revenue volatility** — Weather-dependent claims estimating. Q3 was weak (hurricane season timing).

## 5. DECISION FRAMEWORK

```
IF BEAR scenario:
  → IF price drops to $150-165:
    → EVALUATE: Is the guidance cut temporary (soft market cycle) or structural?
    → IF temporary: Entry range $135-140 still valid. Watch for further pullback.
    → IF structural (growth ceiling confirmed <5%): LOWER FV to $160-170, entry to $120-130.
    → IF price reaches $135-140: FAST-TRACK R4 (investment-committee).
  → IF AccuLynx litigation materially negative:
    → LOWER FV by damages estimate ($50-200M = $0.35-$1.40/share impact)

IF BASE scenario:
  → NO ACTION on VRSK
  → FV $185 confirmed by earnings
  → Entry remains $135-140, wait for market catalyst (SaaSpocalypse deepening, sector rotation)
  → Consider R4 if price trends toward $150 over next 3-6 months

IF BULL scenario:
  → NO ACTION (moving away from entry)
  → IF guide raises FV implications:
    → Revise FV upward to $195-200 (max, conservative)
    → Revise entry to $145-155
  → Monitor for disconnect between bullish guide and soft market data
```

## 6. KILL CONDITIONS FOR PIPELINE

| KC# | Condition | Action |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| KC#1 | Subscription revenue growth <4% for 2 consecutive quarters | REMOVE from pipeline |
| KC#2 | ROIC falls below 25% (from 38.3%) | Downgrade QS, likely REMOVE |
| KC#3 | AccuLynx/FTC damages >$500M | Recalculate FV net of damages |
| KC#4 | FY2026 guide implies organic revenue growth <4% | LOWER entry by equivalent MoS |
| KC#5 | EBITDA margin contracts to <52% | Reassess operating leverage thesis |
| KC#6 | SaaSpocalypse deepens: VRSK P/E compresses below 20x sustainably | Reassess whether multiple recovery is realistic |

## 7. R4 GATE CRITERIA

This earnings report is the HARD GATE before submitting to investment-committee (R4). Criteria to proceed:

| Gate | Condition | Pass/Fail |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| G1 | Organic growth >=5% in Q4 | Confirms not in structural decline |
| G2 | FY2026 guide >=5% revenue growth | Validates 6% base case assumption |
| G3 | EBITDA margin >=55% maintained | Operating leverage intact |
| G4 | No material litigation escalation | AccuLynx/FTC contained |
| G5 | Price approaches entry ($135-150) within 6 months | Timing practicality |

**If G1-G4 all pass:** R4 approved to proceed when G5 is met (price near entry).
**If any of G1-G4 fail:** Re-evaluate FV and entry before R4. May require another DA round.

*Note: VRSK is in research pipeline, not a held position. This framework determines whether earnings support the thesis and enable R4 advancement.*
