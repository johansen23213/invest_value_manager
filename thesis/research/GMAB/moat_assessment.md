# Moat Assessment: GMAB (Genmab A/S)

## Fecha: 2026-02-12

## Clasificacion: NARROW

**Rationale:** Genmab possesses genuine intangible asset advantages through its proprietary antibody platforms (DuoBody, HexaBody, HexElect, DuoHexaBody) that have produced multiple approved therapies. However, the moat is narrower than it initially appears because: (1) the single largest revenue contributor, Darzalex royalties (~64% of revenue), faces patent cliffs starting late 2020s, (2) the transition from royalty collector to integrated biopharma introduces execution risk and capital intensity that dilutes the asset-light advantage, (3) the $8B Merus acquisition shifts the balance sheet from net cash to leveraged, and (4) HexaBody-CD38 discontinuation demonstrates the "next Darzalex" replacement is far from guaranteed.

## Fuentes de Moat Identificadas

| Fuente | Presente | Evidencia | Durabilidad | Trayectoria |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Cost advantage | NO | Asset-light royalty model delivers 95% gross margin, but this is a business model choice, not a structural cost advantage vs competitors. Genmab does not produce drugs cheaper than peers -- it licenses IP. As own-commercialization grows, cost structure normalizes. | N/A | -> (declining as COGS rise with own-commercial) |
| Network effects | NO | No network effects in biotech drug development. Each product competes on clinical efficacy, not on user base. | N/A | N/A |
| Intangible assets | YES | **PRIMARY MOAT SOURCE.** 4 proprietary antibody platforms (DuoBody, HexaBody, HexElect, DuoHexaBody). 7+ approved therapies. Patent portfolio covering daratumumab through late 2020s/early 2030s. Darzalex patents (Genmab-owned) expiring late 2020s-early 2030s; Janssen-owned SC patents through mid-2030s. EPKINLY (epcoritamab) with FDA approvals in 3 indications and growing. Kesimpta royalties from Novartis (150K+ patients treated). Petosemtamab (from Merus) with 2 Breakthrough Therapy Designations. | 10-15 years (declining as Darzalex patents expire, partially offset by new products) | -> (mixed: Darzalex declining, EPKINLY growing, Merus pipeline unproven) |
| Switching costs | PARTIAL | Oncologists and hematologists build treatment protocols around specific drugs. Once Darzalex/EPKINLY is standard of care (SOC), switching requires new clinical evidence. Darzalex is deeply entrenched in multiple myeloma SOC across all lines. EPKINLY gaining SOC status in lymphoma. However, biosimilars can replicate the molecule, and new drug classes can displace SOC entirely. Switching costs are for the DRUG, not for Genmab as a company. | 8-12 years (for current SOC positions, eroding with biosimilars) | -> (stable for now, declining post-patent) |
| Efficient scale | NO | Biotech/pharma is a massive market with hundreds of competitors. No natural monopoly characteristics. | N/A | N/A |

## Evidencia Cuantitativa

### Returns on Capital vs Peers

| Metrica | GMAB | REGN (Regeneron) | ABBV (AbbVie) | Sector Median |
|---------|------|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| ROIC (latest) | 25.9% | ~13% | ~19% | ~12-15% |
| ROIC-WACC spread | +17.0pp | ~+4-5pp | ~+10pp | ~+2-5pp |
| Gross Margin | 95.4% | ~87% | ~70% | 55% |
| FCF Margin | 34.7% | ~35% | ~25% | ~15-20% |
| Net Debt/EBITDA | Net Cash* | Net Cash | ~3-4x | Varies |

*Pre-Merus acquisition. Post-Merus (Dec 2025): ~$5.5B debt raised, target <3x leverage within 2 years.

### ROIC Trajectory (Genmab)

| Year | ROIC | WACC | Spread |
|------|------|------|--------|
| 2021 | 21.0% | ~8.9% | +12.1pp |
| 2022 | 29.8% | ~8.9% | +20.9pp |
| 2023 | 24.6% | ~8.9% | +15.7pp |
| 2024 | 25.9% | ~8.9% | +17.0pp |

ROIC has been consistently above WACC for 4 years with data available. Limited to 4-year trajectory (company IPO'd earlier but consistent profitability is more recent). This is a shorter track record than the 10+ year standard for Wide moat classification.

### Gross Margin Premium

| Metrica | GMAB | Sector Median | Premium |
|---------|------|---------------|---------|
| Gross Margin (2024) | 95.4% | 55.0% | +40.4pp |

**CRITICAL CAVEAT:** The 95% gross margin is an artifact of the royalty business model, NOT a manufacturing cost advantage. Genmab's royalty revenue has near-zero COGS (it is essentially licensing income). As EPKINLY own-commercialization scales and Merus pipeline requires manufacturing, the blended gross margin will structurally decline. This is already visible: 100% (2021) -> 95.4% (2024). The decline will accelerate.

### Revenue Concentration Risk

| Revenue Source | % of Revenue (2024 est.) | Risk Level |
|---------------|--------------------------|------------|
| Darzalex royalties (J&J) | ~64% | HIGH -- patent cliff late 2020s |
| Kesimpta royalties (Novartis) | ~10-12% | MEDIUM -- MS market competitive |
| EPKINLY product sales + collab | ~8-10% | LOW -- growing rapidly, own product |
| Other royalties (RYBREVANT, TECVAYLI, TALVEY, TEPEZZA) | ~10-12% | MEDIUM -- diversified but smaller |
| Milestones and other | ~5% | LOW |

**Single-product dependency:** Darzalex at 64% of revenue is the dominant source. This is the KEY vulnerability.

## Key Question: Is the Moat in the PLATFORM or in DARZALEX?

### Platform Moat Assessment

**DuoBody Platform:**
- Produced: EPKINLY (epcoritamab), RYBREVANT (amivantamab -- J&J), acasunlimab (BioNTech -- DISCONTINUED)
- Status: Validated, with multiple approved products. This IS a genuine platform advantage.
- Durability: 15-20 years. The engineering capability to create bispecific antibodies is a rare and valuable skill.

**HexaBody Platform:**
- Produced: HexaBody-CD38 (DISCONTINUED March 2025 after J&J declined license)
- Status: The flagship HexaBody application FAILED to advance. This is a significant negative signal for the platform's commercial viability.
- Durability: UNCERTAIN. One approved product (none from this platform alone).

**Assessment:**
The platform has real value -- it has produced 7+ approved therapies and the DuoBody bispecific technology is validated. However, the platform is NOT self-evidently a Wide moat because:
1. Competitors (Regeneron, Amgen, Roche, Zymeworks) have comparable antibody engineering capabilities
2. The bispecific antibody space has 180+ companies and 250+ therapeutic candidates
3. HexaBody-CD38 failure shows the platform does not guarantee commercial success
4. Each new drug still requires >$1B investment and 8-12 years of clinical development

**Conclusion:** The moat is PARTIALLY in the platform (ability to generate candidates) and PARTIALLY in Darzalex/EPKINLY (approved, revenue-generating products). The platform provides a "moat renewal" mechanism, but each new product is a probabilistic bet, not a certainty.

## Patent Cliff Analysis

### Darzalex Patent Timeline

| Patent Type | Geography | Expiry | Impact |
|-------------|-----------|--------|--------|
| Composition of matter (Genmab) | US/EU/Japan | March 2026 (initial), but extended through late 2020s/early 2030s | Biosimilar development requires this to expire |
| Method of use/formulation (Genmab) | US/EU/Japan | Late 2020s - early 2030s | Extends royalty obligation |
| SC formulation patents (Janssen) | US/EU/Japan | Mid-2030s | Protects FASPRO, but Genmab's royalty depends on GENMAB patents |
| Royalty obligation duration | Global | Until last Genmab-owned patent expires | Country-by-country reduction |

**Key risk:** Genmab's royalties from Darzalex are tied to GENMAB-owned patents, not Janssen's. Once Genmab patents expire in a country, royalties face reduction. Biosimilar entry compounds this.

### Biosimilar Timeline

| Biosimilar Candidate | Developer | Stage | Estimated Launch |
|---------------------|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| HLX 15 | Henlius/Dr. Reddy's | Phase 3 | Late 2020s |
| CT-P44 | Celltrion | Phase 3 (initiated Nov 2024) | ~2028-2030 |
| Xdarzane | Xbrane | Preclinical | >2030 |

**Assessment:** Biosimilar entry likely 2029-2031 in US/EU. Monoclonal antibody biosimilars typically capture 30-40% of market within 3 years, but daratumumab biosimilars face a higher technical bar (biologics are harder to replicate). Genmab royalty erosion expected to be gradual, not a cliff.

### Revenue Replacement Math

| Item | Revenue (2025 est.) | Revenue (2030 est.) | Notes |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Darzalex royalties | ~$2.2B | ~$1.5-2.0B | Erosion from patent expiry + biosimilars |
| EPKINLY | ~$500M+ | ~$2-3B | Multi-indication expansion, own product |
| Petosemtamab (Merus) | $0 | ~$0.5-1.0B | If Phase 3 succeeds; launch ~2028-2029 |
| Kesimpta royalties | ~$400M | ~$400-500M | Stable, MS market growing |
| Rina-S (ProfoundBio) | $0 | ~$0.2-0.5B | Ovarian/endometrial, earlier stage |
| Other royalties | ~$400M | ~$300-400M | RYBREVANT, TECVAYLI etc. |
| **Total** | **~$3.5B** | **~$5.0-7.4B** | Range reflects pipeline uncertainty |

The revenue replacement is PLAUSIBLE but requires 2-3 pipeline products to succeed. Probability-weighted, this is a reasonable bet but far from guaranteed.

## Pipeline Depth and Quality

### Late-Stage Pipeline (Phase 3)

| Drug | Indication | Partner | Stage | Data Timeline | Peak Sales Potential |
|------|-----------|---------|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| Epcoritamab (EPKINLY) | DLBCL 1L, FL, NHL | AbbVie (profit share) | Phase 3 (multiple) | 2026 (DLBCL-2, DLBCL-4) | $3-5B |
| Petosemtamab | Head & Neck Cancer | Own (from Merus) | Phase 3 | 2026 (interim) | $1-3B |
| Rina-S | Ovarian/Endometrial | Own (from ProfoundBio) | Phase 2/3 | 2026-2027 | $1-2B |

### Assessment of "Next Darzalex"

EPKINLY is the most credible Darzalex replacement:
- Already approved in 65+ countries for lymphoma
- $333M in 9M 2025 sales (64% growth rate)
- 5 Phase 3 trials running simultaneously
- Potential to become SOC in DLBCL 1L (large market)
- Key risk: EPCORE DLBCL-1 showed HR 0.74 in monotherapy -- good but not transformative

However, EPKINLY economics differ from Darzalex:
- Darzalex: 20% royalty on $13B+ sales = pure profit, zero COGS
- EPKINLY: Own product sales + AbbVie profit share = higher revenue but also higher costs
- Blended margins will be lower even if total profit grows

**Verdict:** EPKINLY can partially replace Darzalex economics, but the business model transformation from royalty to integrated pharma structurally changes the margin profile.

## Partnership Model vs Own-Commercialization

| Dimension | Royalty Model | Own-Commercialization |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| Gross Margin | ~95-100% | ~70-80% (pharma norm) |
| Revenue per product | Lower (royalty rate) | Higher (full price) |
| Capital requirement | Minimal | Heavy (sales force, manufacturing, regulatory) |
| Risk per product | Low (partner bears costs) | High (Genmab bears costs) |
| Control | Low | High |
| Scalability | High | Moderate |
| Predictability | High (once approved) | Moderate |
| Moat durability | Depends on patents | Depends on franchise |

**Genmab is transitioning toward own-commercialization.** This is strategically sensible (capture more value per product) but introduces:
1. **Execution risk:** Building commercial infrastructure is expensive and error-prone
2. **Margin compression:** Inevitable as COGS and SG&A scale with own products
3. **Capital intensity:** Merus acquisition ($8B, $5.5B debt) transforms the balance sheet
4. **Binary pipeline risk:** Own products that fail destroy capital, not just royalty streams

The transition makes the moat NARROWER in the medium term because it replaces high-certainty, low-risk royalty streams with higher-potential but higher-risk own product revenue.

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors in Bispecific Antibodies

| Company | Platform | Key Bispecific Products | Market Cap |
|---------|----------|------------------------|-----------|
| Regeneron | VelociSuite | Odronextamab (B-cell lymphoma) | ~$82B |
| Amgen | BiTE (bispecific T-cell engager) | Blincyto (ALL), Imdelltra (SCLC) | ~$175B |
| Roche/Genentech | CrossMAb | Glofitamab (lymphoma), Faricimab (eye) | ~$200B |
| AbbVie | N/A (partners with Genmab on EPKINLY) | EPKINLY (co-commercialization) | ~$340B |
| Zymeworks | Azymetric | Earlier stage programs | ~$1B |
| Immunocore | ImmTAC | Kimmtrak (melanoma) | ~$3B |

### Genmab's Position
- **Strengths:** Validated DuoBody platform, multiple approved products, EPKINLY gaining market share, subcutaneous delivery advantage over IV competitors
- **Weaknesses:** Much smaller than big pharma competitors (~$18B vs $80-340B), dependent on partnership economics for largest revenue streams, limited commercial infrastructure
- **Relative position:** Top 5 in bispecific antibody innovation, but NOT dominant. The space has 180+ companies.

## Amenazas al Moat

| Amenaza | Probabilidad | Impacto | Horizonte |
|---------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Darzalex biosimilar erosion | Alta | Alto (64% of revenue at risk) | 3-5 years (2029-2031) |
| EPKINLY fails to scale in 1L DLBCL | Media | Alto (replacement thesis weakens) | 2-3 years (Phase 3 readouts 2026) |
| Merus/petosemtamab Phase 3 failure | Media | Alto ($8B acquisition at risk) | 1-2 years (2026 interim data) |
| New drug modalities (CAR-T, ADC) displacing bispecifics | Baja-Media | Medio (category risk) | 5-10 years |
| Balance sheet stress from $5.5B debt + pipeline spending | Baja-Media | Medio (constrains optionality) | 2-4 years |
| J&J/Novartis partnership disputes (already had Darzalex SC arbitration loss) | Media | Medio (royalty reduction) | Ongoing |
| HexaBody platform commercial failure (CD38 discontinued) | Ya materializada | Medio (one fewer moat pillar) | Now |
| AI/computational biology disrupting antibody discovery advantage | Baja | Alto (eliminates platform scarcity) | 5-15 years |

---

## Escenarios de Erosion

### Escenario 1: Gradual Erosion (Most Probable, 50% probability)
Darzalex royalties decline 20-30% by 2031 due to biosimilar entry and patent expiry. EPKINLY grows to $2-3B but at lower margins than Darzalex royalties. Petosemtamab succeeds but takes until 2029-2030 for meaningful revenue. Total profitability grows modestly but margin profile permanently shifts lower. Moat narrows from platform + Darzalex to platform + diversified product portfolio. ROIC remains above WACC but spread compresses to 10-12pp from 17pp.

### Escenario 2: Accelerated Erosion (Tail Risk, 20% probability)
Darzalex biosimilar entry earlier than expected (2028). EPKINLY Phase 3 data in 1L DLBCL disappoints (non-inferior but not clearly superior to CAR-T or other bispecifics). Petosemtamab interim data fails or shows marginal efficacy. $5.5B debt becomes burdensome with slower-than-expected revenue growth. Genmab forced to partner/outlicense petosemtamab at inferior terms. ROIC falls to near WACC. Moat classification downgrades to NONE.

### Escenario 3: Moat Strengthening (Bull Case, 30% probability)
EPKINLY becomes SOC in 1L DLBCL (Phase 3 data 2026 transformative). Petosemtamab shows breakthrough efficacy in head & neck cancer. Darzalex biosimilar entry delayed to 2031+. DuoBody platform generates additional products. Genmab becomes the "Regeneron of bispecifics." ROIC expands to 30%+. Moat widens from Narrow to potentially Wide by 2030.

## Moat Score: 17/25

### Breakdown

| Component | Score | Max | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| GM Premium vs Sector | 10 | 10 | +40.4pp premium, extraordinary (though partially structural from business model) |
| Market Position | 3 | 8 | Top 5 in bispecifics, but not #1-2 in any single market. Darzalex is #1 in MM but that is J&J's drug. EPKINLY gaining share in lymphoma but still small. |
| ROIC Persistence | 4 | 7 | Only 4 years of consistent data. ROIC clearly > WACC but short track record. Pre-2020 Genmab was a very different company. |

---

## Discrepancias con Thesis (si aplica)

The sector screening suggested QS 77. My assessment supports the financial metrics (ROIC, margins, growth are excellent) but I would flag the following adjustments for the fundamental analyst:

1. **Gross margin is structurally overstated** for moat purposes. The 95% GM reflects royalty revenue, not a cost advantage. As own-commercialization scales, expect convergence toward 70-80%. The moat-relevant margin is the blended forward margin, not the current royalty-era margin.

2. **Capital allocation score of 0/10 is accurate but concerning.** Zero insider ownership, zero dividends, zero buybacks. The $8B Merus acquisition is a massive bet with unproven returns. This is NOT a capital allocation track record that supports a Quality Compounder classification.

3. **The ROIC will be materially affected by the Merus acquisition.** $5.5B of new debt + $8B goodwill will inflate invested capital and reduce ROIC. The 25.9% ROIC is the "pre-acquisition peak" and may not be representative of the go-forward company.

4. **Morningstar assigns NARROW moat.** I agree with this classification. The bull case for Wide moat requires the platform to consistently generate replacement blockbusters, which is unproven.

---

## 🔄 META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres

1. **Darzalex patent expiry dates are inconsistent across sources.** Some say March 2026 (composition of matter), others say "late 2020s to early 2030s." The distinction between Genmab-owned vs Janssen-owned patents is critical for royalty duration but hard to pin down precisely from public sources. The most conservative interpretation is that royalty reductions begin in some countries by 2027-2028 and become material by 2030-2031.

2. **Merus acquisition impact on ROIC.** The $8B acquisition closed Dec 2025 but 2024 financials don't reflect it. The quality scorer shows pre-acquisition metrics. Post-acquisition ROIC will be significantly lower due to goodwill and debt. This is a CRITICAL gap in the quantitative assessment.

3. **EPKINLY profit-sharing economics with AbbVie.** I could not determine the exact economic split between Genmab and AbbVie for EPKINLY. If it's 50/50 profit share, the economics are much less favorable than Darzalex royalties. This matters enormously for the revenue replacement thesis.

4. **Insider ownership at 0% is suspicious.** This could be a data gap from yfinance (Danish listed company with ADRs) rather than genuinely zero insider ownership. The CEO and board likely own shares. Need to verify from proxy statements.

### Sugerencias de Mejora

1. **Pharma-specific moat assessment module:** Biotech/pharma companies have unique moat dynamics (patent cliffs, pipeline optionality, FDA exclusivity) that the standard 5-source framework doesn't capture well. A sub-framework for pharma moat assessment would improve accuracy. Relevant for NVO, SAN.PA, and any future pharma positions.

2. **Post-acquisition ROIC adjustment:** When a company has recently completed a major acquisition, quality_scorer.py should flag that historical ROIC may not represent the go-forward company. A manual adjustment note should be required.

### Anomalias Detectadas

1. **Quality scorer shows 0% insider ownership.** This is almost certainly a data issue with yfinance for Danish ADRs, not a real zero. Genmab CEO Jan van de Winkel likely holds shares. This inflates the moat risk perception slightly.

2. **Declining gross margin trajectory flagged by tool.** The tool correctly flags GM declining from 100% to 95.4%. But this is EXPECTED and POSITIVE -- it reflects the transition from pure royalty to own-commercialization, which increases total profit even as margin percentage declines. The tool's "Declining" flag is technically correct but misleading in context.

3. **The $5.5B debt from Merus acquisition is NOT reflected in the quality scorer output.** The tool shows "Net Cash" and $142M total debt. This is stale data. Post-acquisition, Genmab has ~$5.6B total debt. This fundamentally changes the leverage profile from "fortress" to "leveraged."

### Preguntas para Orchestrator

1. Should the QS be adjusted downward for the Merus acquisition impact? My estimate: Financial Quality drops ~8 points (leverage from 10/10 to ~5/10, FCF margin may compress), Capital Allocation improves slightly (Merus was a bold but potentially value-creating move). Net adjustment: QS 77 -> ~70-72 (Tier B, not A). This is a MATERIAL reclassification question.

2. Should we wait for Q4 2025 / FY2025 results (which will include Merus) before proceeding to full thesis, so the quality scorer reflects the actual company?

3. How much weight should the Darzalex patent cliff risk carry in the moat assessment? Morningstar says patents extend to 2031-2035 but I found sources suggesting some key Genmab patents expire earlier. This is a multi-billion-dollar uncertainty.
