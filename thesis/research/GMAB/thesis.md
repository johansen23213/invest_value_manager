# GMAB - Genmab A/S

> **Fair Value:** $36
> **Date:** 2026-02-12
> **Stage:** R1 (Fundamental Analysis)
> **Analyst:** fundamental-analyst

## TL;DR

Genmab is a Danish biotech that earns ~$2.5B/yr in royalties from Darzalex (the #1 multiple myeloma drug at $14.4B sales) via J&J, plus growing proprietary product sales (EPKINLY, TIVDAK). QS Tool 77 but adjusted to 65 (Tier B) due to (a) Darzalex patent cliff 2028-2031 destroying the royalty stream, (b) $5.5B debt from Merus acquisition transforming the balance sheet from net cash to leveraged, and (c) 0% insider ownership/dividends. At $29.59, the stock offers ~18% MoS vs base case FV of $36, but the risk profile is materially different from what the headline financials suggest -- this is a company betting its future on pipeline execution during a patent cliff.

## Quality Score

**QS Tool: 77/100 (Tier A)**
**QS Adjusted: 65/100 (Tier B)**

### Adjustment: -12 points (documented quantitative evidence)

| Adjustment | Points | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Darzalex patent cliff (EU 2028, US 2029) | -5 | 64% of revenue is Darzalex royalties; biosimilars will erode 50-70% of royalty stream by 2032 |
| Balance sheet transformation: net cash to ~$5.5B debt (Merus) | -5 | Leverage goes from net cash to ~3x EBITDA; violates tool's 10/10 leverage score |
| Gross margin decline trajectory (100% -> 95.4%) | -2 | As mix shifts from pure royalties to proprietary products with COGS, GM will compress further to ~70-80% |

**Rationale:** The tool scores GMAB based on trailing financials (2024), which reflect a pure royalty-collection model with near-100% gross margins, zero debt, and explosive growth from Darzalex market expansion. But GMAB's FUTURE looks materially different: (1) Darzalex faces EU patent expiry 2028 and US 2029, meaning the $2.5B royalty stream begins declining ~2029; (2) the $8B Merus acquisition (closed Dec 2025) adds $5.5B in debt, transforming the balance sheet; (3) the company must successfully commercialize 4 proprietary products (EPKINLY, TIVDAK, Rina-S, petosemtamab) to replace declining royalties. The trailing QS of 77 is accurate for today's financials but misleading for forward risk.

### QS Breakdown (Tool output)

| Category | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Financial Quality | 40/40 | ROIC 25.9%, FCF margin 34.7%, net cash, FCF consistent 4/4 |
| Growth Quality | 20/25 | Rev CAGR +32.8%, EPS CAGR +34.5%, but GM declining (-5pp in 3yr) |
| Moat Evidence | 17/25 | GM premium +40pp vs sector, ROIC persistence strong, market position scored 0/8 (manual) |
| Capital Allocation | 0/10 | No dividends, 0% insider ownership per tool |

**Tier: B (adjusted)**

## Business Understanding

### Business Model

Genmab is a Danish biotech company that develops antibody-based therapies for cancer and other diseases. Founded in 1999, it has pioneered proprietary antibody technologies (DuoBody, HexaBody, DuoHexaBody) that power 8 approved medicines.

**Revenue model is in transition:**

| Revenue Stream | 2024 | % of Total | Growth | Durability |
|---------------|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Darzalex royalties (J&J) | ~$1.9B | ~64% | +23% YoY | AT RISK: Patent cliff 2028-2031 |
| Kesimpta royalties (Novartis) | ~$350M | ~12% | +19% YoY | Growing: MS drug, patent to ~2035 |
| EPKINLY product sales | ~$450M ann. | ~15% | +74% YoY | Growing: Oncology bispecific |
| TIVDAK product sales | ~$160M ann. | ~5% | +30% YoY | Growing: ADC cervical cancer |
| Other (milestones, services) | ~$100M | ~3% | Variable | Declining as partnerships mature |

**Key:** The company is transitioning from a royalty-collection model (high margin, low risk, someone else does the work) to a proprietary commercial model (lower margin, higher investment, full execution risk). This is the central investment tension.

### Problem Solved

Genmab addresses unmet medical needs in oncology and autoimmune disease through next-generation antibody engineering. Its DuoBody technology creates bispecific antibodies (binding two targets simultaneously), enabling more precise cancer cell killing. Darzalex (anti-CD38) revolutionized multiple myeloma treatment and is now standard of care.

### Revenue Model Type

- **Licensing/Royalties** (64%): High margin (~100%), recurrente, but dependent on partner execution and patent life
- **Product Sales** (20%): Growing rapidly but with COGS, S&M, manufacturing costs (margins ~60-70%)
- **Milestone Payments** (3%): Lumpy, non-recurring

### Unit Economics

Traditional LTV/CAC is not directly applicable for a biotech licensing model. The relevant unit economics are:

- **Cost per approved drug:** ~$2.6B industry average; Genmab's platform reduces this via antibody technology reuse
- **Revenue per approved product:** Darzalex alone = $14.4B sales (Genmab gets ~$2.5B royalties). Extraordinary return on investment
- **Pipeline ROI:** 8 approved medicines from 25 years of R&D; exceptional hit rate vs industry ~10%
- **FCF Margin:** 34.7% (2024), reflecting the high-margin royalty model

### Capital Intensity

- **Asset-light** currently: Capex ~2% of revenue, minimal working capital needs
- **Transitioning to asset-medium:** Own manufacturing (DK facility), commercial infrastructure for EPKINLY/TIVDAK/Rina-S/petosemtamab will increase SG&A materially

### Margin Structure

| Metric | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 9M 2025 | Trend |
|--------|------|------|------|------|---------|-------|
| Gross Margin | 100.0% | 100.0% | 98.6% | 95.4% | ~93% est. | DECLINING |
| Operating Margin | 35.1% | 43.2% | 32.3% | 32.5% | ~33% | Stable |
| FCF Margin | 23.5% | 24.8% | 42.5% | 34.7% | ~35% | Volatile |

**Declining gross margin is expected and structural:** As product sales (EPKINLY, TIVDAK) grow as share of revenue, COGS increases. Pure royalties have ~100% gross margin; own products have ~70-80%. This is a QUALITY issue: the high QS reflects the old model, not the future model.

## Why Is It Cheap?

### Market Narrative

The market prices GMAB at P/E 13x (vs biotech sector 20-25x and GMAB's own historical 25-35x) due to:

1. **Darzalex patent cliff** (PRIMARY): EU patent expiry 2028, US 2029. The $14.4B franchise ($2.5B in royalties to GMAB) faces biosimilar erosion. Market fears 50-70% royalty loss by 2032.
2. **Merus acquisition risk**: $8B all-cash deal ($5.5B debt financed) to buy petosemtamab for head & neck cancer. Execution risk on integration, Phase 3 data, and commercialization. Balance sheet transformed from net cash to leveraged.
3. **Pipeline dependency**: Can EPKINLY, Rina-S, petosemtamab, and TIVDAK collectively replace $2.5B in declining Darzalex royalties? Market doubts.
4. **J&J arbitration loss**: Genmab lost appeal in Darzalex royalties arbitration (sought higher royalty rate). Confirmed that J&J controls the economics.
5. **Sector rotation away from biotech**: Healthcare/biotech has been out of favor with fund flows.

### My Counter-Thesis

| Market believes | I believe | Evidence | Prob I'm wrong |
|----------------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Darzalex cliff will destroy value | Cliff is real but managed -- royalties don't vanish overnight, biosimilars take 3-5 years to erode biologics (Humira analogy: biosimilars at 23% share after 2 years) | Biosimilar uptake for complex biologics is slower than small molecules; Darzalex SC formulation may retain share | 30% |
| Merus acquisition is risky overpay | Petosemtamab has 2 BTDs from FDA, Phase 3 readouts 2026, potential launch 2027 in unmet need (H&N cancer). Adds 100%-owned asset vs royalty dependency | Genmab paid ~40x forward peak sales, aggressive but within biotech M&A norms | 35% |
| Pipeline cannot replace royalties | EPKINLY growing +74% YoY ($450M run rate), Rina-S has BTD for endometrial cancer, petosemtamab for H&N. Combined peak sales estimated at $5-8B | Execution risk on all 3 pipeline launches simultaneously | 35% |
| Balance sheet is now risky | $5.5B debt is prepayable, target <3x leverage in 2 years. FCF of $1B+ supports rapid deleveraging | Requires pipeline execution + continued Darzalex royalties during transition | 25% |

### Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | SI/NO | Comment |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Industry in secular decline | NO | Biotech/oncology is growing 8-10% CAGR |
| Technological disruption imminent | NO | Antibody engineering is becoming MORE relevant |
| Management destroying value | MAYBE | $8B Merus at 40x peak revenue is aggressive |
| Balance sheet deteriorating | YES | Net cash to $5.5B debt post-Merus |
| Insider selling >5% 12m | NO | CEO owns 1.07% ($201M), stable |
| Dividend cut recent/probable | N/A | Never paid dividends |
| Market share loss >2pp 3yr | NO | Darzalex gaining share (now >$14B) |
| ROIC < WACC last 3 years | NO | ROIC 25.9% >> WACC 8.9% |
| FCF negative >2 years | NO | FCF positive 4/4 years, $1B+ |
| Goodwill >50% equity | PENDING | Post-Merus goodwill will be material (~$6-7B vs equity ~$6B) |

**Total: 1-2/10 (low value trap risk on trailing, but forward risk is higher)**

### My Informational Advantage

- [x] Longer time horizon (market prices cliff impact linearly; I can model the transition curve)
- [x] Market over-reacts to patent cliff (Humira precedent: biosimilar penetration is slow for complex biologics)
- [ ] Better business understanding (partial -- Merus integration is genuinely uncertain)
- [x] Public information mal-interpreted (the 95% gross margin looks unsustainably good; once it normalizes to 70-80%, P/E will seem more appropriate)

## Projections with Logic

### Revenue Projection

**TAM:**
- Global oncology market: ~$286B (2025), growing 9-10% CAGR toward ~$460B by 2030
- Multiple myeloma (Darzalex): ~$30B sub-market, growing 8% CAGR
- Follicular lymphoma (EPKINLY): ~$8B sub-market
- Head & neck cancer (petosemtamab): ~$4B sub-market
- Endometrial/cervical (Rina-S/TIVDAK): ~$5B sub-market

**Revenue Build (Bottom-Up):**

| Stream | 2024A | 2025E | 2026E | 2027E | 2028E | 2029E | Logic |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Darzalex royalties | $1,900M | $2,400M | $2,700M | $2,850M | $2,600M | $2,100M | Peak 2027; EU biosimilar erosion starts 2028, US 2029 |
| Kesimpta royalties | $350M | $420M | $500M | $580M | $650M | $700M | Growing steadily, MS market expanding |
| EPKINLY sales | $280M | $500M | $750M | $1,000M | $1,300M | $1,600M | Label expansion (FL, DLBCL 2L), global launch |
| TIVDAK sales | $120M | $180M | $220M | $280M | $330M | $370M | Cervical cancer, moderate growth |
| Petosemtamab | $0 | $0 | $0 | $100M | $400M | $700M | Launch 2027 if Phase 3 positive |
| Rina-S | $0 | $0 | $50M | $200M | $400M | $600M | BTD, filing 2026, launch late 2026/early 2027 |
| Other | $350M | $200M | $150M | $100M | $100M | $100M | Milestones declining |
| **Total** | **$3,000M** | **$3,700M** | **$4,370M** | **$5,110M** | **$5,780M** | **$6,170M** |

**Revenue CAGR (2024-2029E): ~15.5%**

**Key assumptions:**
- Darzalex royalties peak in 2027 at ~$2.85B then decline ~10% per year from EU biosimilar entry (2028) and ~20% from US entry (2029)
- EPKINLY achieves $1.6B by 2029 (label expansion to first-line DLBCL, FL combinations)
- Petosemtamab launches 2027 with Phase 3 success (70% probability)
- Rina-S launches late 2026 with accelerated approval (80% probability given BTD)

### Margin Projection

| Metric | 2024A | 2026E | 2028E | Logic |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Gross Margin | 95.4% | 85% | 78% | Mix shift: more own products (70-80% GM) vs royalties (100% GM) |
| Operating Margin | 32.5% | 28% | 25% | Higher SG&A for commercial launches; R&D remains ~$800M-1B |
| FCF Margin | 34.7% | 25% | 22% | Lower OPM + higher capex for manufacturing |

### WACC Derivation

```
Risk-Free Rate: 4.3% (US 10Y Treasury)
Beta: 0.80 (yfinance, reasonable for biotech with royalty base)
Equity Risk Premium: 5.5% (standard)
Cost of Equity (Ke): 4.3% + 0.80 * 5.5% = 8.7%

Post-Merus capital structure:
  Market Cap: $18.2B
  Total Debt (post-Merus): ~$5.5B
  E/V: 77%
  D/V: 23%

Cost of Debt: ~5.5% (investment grade, prepayable)
Tax Rate: 14.4% (effective, Denmark)
Kd after-tax: 5.5% * (1 - 0.144) = 4.7%

WACC = (0.77 * 8.7%) + (0.23 * 4.7%) = 6.7% + 1.1% = 7.8%

ADJUSTMENT: Given pipeline execution risk and patent cliff uncertainty,
I use WACC = 9.5% (adding ~1.7pp risk premium).
This is higher than the pure calculation because:
(a) Pipeline drugs have binary outcomes (Phase 3 success/failure)
(b) Darzalex cliff timing is uncertain
(c) Post-Merus leverage needs servicing during transition
```

## Valuation

### Method 1: DCF (Primary, 55% weight)

**Using tool output (base run at defaults: 5% growth, 9% WACC, 2.5% terminal):**

| Scenario | FV/Share | MoS% |
|----------|----------|------|
| Bear | $28.92 | -2.3% |
| Base | $35.00 | +18.3% |
| Bull | $43.62 | +47.4% |

**Sensitivity Analysis (from tool):**

| Growth \ WACC | 7.5% | 9.0% | 10.5% |
|---------------|------|------|-------|
| 2.0% | $39.2 | $31.4 | $26.5 |
| 3.5% | $41.5 | $33.2 | $27.9 |
| 5.0% | $44.0 | $35.0 | $29.4 |
| 6.5% | $46.6 | $36.9 | $30.9 |
| 8.0% | $49.4 | $39.0 | $32.5 |

**DCF Assessment:**
- FV Spread: 65% -- HIGH sensitivity
- TV as % of EV: 74.5% -- HIGH terminal value dependency
- This means DCF is UNRELIABLE as a point estimate; use as range ($29-44)

**My derived DCF (manual calculation):**

Using my projection framework (10% FCF growth Y1-3 then declining to 5% Y4-5, WACC 9.5%, terminal 2.5%):

```
FCF Base: $1.0B (2024)
Y1: $1.10B (EPKINLY + Darzalex peak)
Y2: $1.21B
Y3: $1.33B
Y4: $1.26B (Darzalex cliff begins offsetting growth)
Y5: $1.19B (cliff deepens)
Terminal: $1.19B * (1.025) / (0.095 - 0.025) = $17.4B

PV of FCFs: $1.01 + $1.01 + $1.01 + $0.87 + $0.75 = $4.65B
PV of TV: $17.4B / (1.095)^5 = $11.0B
Enterprise Value: $15.65B
- Net Debt post-Merus: -$2.1B (cash $3.4B - debt $5.5B = -$2.1B net debt)
Equity Value: $15.65B - $2.1B = $13.55B
Shares: 615M
FV = $22.0/share
```

Wait -- this is substantially lower than the tool's output because the tool uses trailing FCF and doesn't account for the Merus debt. The tool's net debt figure of -$3.27B (net CASH) reflects pre-Merus balance sheet. POST-Merus, net debt is approximately +$2.1B (net DEBT), which reduces equity value by ~$5.4B.

**CRITICAL ADJUSTMENT:** The DCF tool shows FV $35 but uses net debt of -$3.27B (net cash). Post-Merus, this becomes approximately +$2.1B (net debt). This adjustment alone reduces FV by approximately $5.4B / 615M shares = **-$8.77/share**.

**Adjusted DCF FV: $35.00 - $8.77 = ~$26/share** (tool base, post-Merus adjusted)

However, the tool's 5% growth rate may be too conservative given EPKINLY's 74% growth. Using 8% growth with Merus adjustment:

**DCF range post-Merus: $26-$35/share** depending on growth assumptions.

### Method 2: EV/EBIT Normalized (Secondary, 45% weight)

This is more appropriate given the patent cliff and transition dynamics.

```
EBIT 2024: ~$970M (operating income)
EBIT 2025E: ~$1,200M (midpoint of guidance)
EBIT 2026E: ~$1,300M (continued Darzalex growth + EPKINLY)

Normalized EBIT (mid-cycle, accounting for patent cliff):
Average of 2025-2028E: ~$1,200M

Multiple:
- Pharma sector: 10-14x EV/EBIT
- Genmab specifics:
  + Superior ROIC (+17pp spread): +1x
  + Pipeline optionality (4 products): +1x
  + Patent cliff approaching: -2x
  + Post-Merus leverage: -1x
  = Base multiple: 11x (sector midpoint + adjustments)

Enterprise Value = $1,200M * 11x = $13,200M
Less: Net Debt post-Merus = $2,100M
Equity Value = $11,100M
Shares: 615M
FV = $18.05/share

PROBLEM: This seems too low. Reason: normalized EBIT mid-cycle undersells the growth trajectory.

ALTERNATIVE: Forward EV/EBIT on 2027E EBIT ~$1,400M at 12x = $16,800M
Less net debt (being paid down): $1,500M (assume partial deleveraging)
Equity = $15,300M / 615M = $24.9/share
```

**EV/EBIT range: $18-$25/share**

### Method 3: Sum-of-Parts (Sanity Check)

```
Darzalex royalty stream (NPV of declining royalties 2026-2035):
  ~$2.5B/yr declining to ~$500M/yr over 10 years
  NPV at 10% discount: ~$12B

Kesimpta royalties (NPV):
  ~$500M/yr growing to ~$800M, then stable
  NPV at 10%: ~$5B

EPKINLY (100% owned):
  Peak sales $2B+, 25% operating margin
  Value at 5x peak revenue (biotech norm): ~$10B
  Risk-adjusted (70% prob): ~$7B

Petosemtamab (100% owned, post-Merus):
  Peak sales $1.5-2B, Phase 3 pending
  Value at 3x peak revenue: ~$5B
  Risk-adjusted (50% prob): ~$2.5B

Rina-S (100% owned):
  Peak sales $1B, BTD
  Value at 3x peak: ~$3B
  Risk-adjusted (60% prob): ~$1.8B

TIVDAK:
  Peak sales $500M
  Value at 3x: $1.5B (90% prob): ~$1.35B

Total Asset Value: ~$29.65B
Less: Net Debt post-Merus: $2.1B
Less: Corporate overhead (10%): $2.97B
Equity Value: ~$24.6B
Per share: ~$40/share
```

### Reconciliation

| Method | FV/Share | Weight | Weighted |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| DCF (post-Merus adjusted) | $30 | 35% | $10.50 |
| EV/EBIT normalized | $22 | 25% | $5.50 |
| Sum-of-Parts (risk-adjusted) | $40 | 40% | $16.00 |
| **Weighted Average** | | **100%** | **$32.00** |

**Wide divergence between methods (82% spread between $22 and $40).** This reflects genuine uncertainty about the pipeline transition. The DCF and EV/EBIT methods penalize heavily for the patent cliff; the SOTP method values the pipeline optionality.

**My judgment:** I weight SOTP higher (40%) because it correctly separates the declining royalty stream from the growing proprietary business. The EV/EBIT method is too pessimistic because it normalizes through the trough. The DCF tool output is misleading because it doesn't reflect post-Merus leverage.

**Base Fair Value: $36/share** (between weighted avg $32 and SOTP $40, reflecting that SOTP has pipeline risk haircuts already embedded).

## Scenarios

| | Bear | Base | Bull |
|--|------|------|------|
| Thesis | Petosemtamab Phase 3 fails; EPKINLY growth stalls at $800M; Darzalex cliff faster than expected; leverage constrains | Pipeline on track; EPKINLY reaches $1.5B; petosemtamab launches 2027; Darzalex cliff manageable | All pipeline drugs succeed; Darzalex biosimilar penetration slow; rapid deleveraging; M&A optionality |
| FV | $22 | $36 | $48 |
| Probability | 25% | 50% | 25% |

**Expected Value = ($22 * 0.25) + ($36 * 0.50) + ($48 * 0.25) = $5.50 + $18.00 + $12.00 = $35.50**

### MoS Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current Price | $29.59 |
| vs Base FV ($36) | +21.6% |
| vs Expected Value ($35.50) | +20.0% |
| vs Bear Case ($22) | -25.6% |

---

## MoS Assessment

- vs Base: 21.6%
- vs Bear: **-25.6% (NEGATIVE -- price is ABOVE bear case)**
- Required (Tier B, biotech with patent cliff): ~25-30% based on precedents

**Does MoS meet threshold?**

The 21.6% MoS vs base is within the typical Tier B range (20-25% per precedents). However, the negative MoS vs bear case (-25.6%) is concerning. If the bear case materializes, this position would lose ~25% of capital.

Reasoning from principles: This is a Tier B company with significant binary risk (pipeline outcomes). The precedent pattern shows we require higher MoS for companies with execution-dependent theses. PAYC (Tier B, QS 75 adjusted, entry at 25% MoS) is the closest precedent, but PAYC has recurring SaaS revenue with no patent cliff. GMAB's risk profile is higher.

**Verdict on MoS: INSUFFICIENT at current price for a BUY.** The entry price needs to be lower to compensate for the patent cliff + pipeline execution dual risk.

**Suggested entry: $24-26** (MoS 28-33% vs base, closer to bear-base midpoint of $29). This would require a further ~15-19% decline from current $29.59.

---

## Kill Conditions

1. **KC#1: Petosemtamab Phase 3 failure** -- If either FORTIFY-1 or FORTIFY-2 Phase 3 trials fail in 2026, the $8B Merus acquisition becomes a massive overpay. EXIT immediately.
2. **KC#2: Darzalex biosimilar launches earlier than expected** -- If biosimilar daratumumab is approved before 2028 in EU or 2029 in US, royalty erosion accelerates beyond projections. Review thesis immediately.
3. **KC#3: EPKINLY growth stalls (<$600M annual run rate by end 2026)** -- If the lead proprietary product fails to gain traction in label expansion, the revenue replacement thesis fails.
4. **KC#4: Leverage exceeds 4x EBITDA for 2+ consecutive quarters** -- The Merus debt must be managed through cash flow; if leverage spirals, financial distress risk emerges.
5. **KC#5: Rina-S regulatory rejection or major safety signal** -- Rina-S has BTD designation; a rejection or clinical hold would remove a key revenue replacement pillar.
6. **KC#6: J&J Darzalex royalty rate renegotiation downward** -- Any further reduction in royalty economics (already lost arbitration) would directly hit the revenue bridge.
7. **KC#7: CEO departure** -- Jan van de Winkel co-founded the company and has led the pipeline strategy. Departure would signal instability during critical transition.

## Catalysts

| Catalyst | Timeline | Probability | Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Petosemtamab Phase 3 interim readout | H2 2026 | 50% positive | +30% if positive, -20% if negative |
| Rina-S FDA filing/approval | 2026 | 80% | +10-15% |
| EPKINLY label expansion (FL, 2L DLBCL) | 2026 | 70% | +10% |
| Full year 2025 results (Feb 2026) | Q1 2026 | 75% beat | +5-10% |
| Darzalex SC patent durability clarity | 2026-2027 | N/A | Reduces uncertainty |
| Rapid deleveraging from strong FCF | 2026-2027 | 70% | +5% re-rating |

---

## Macro Connection

| Factor | Sensitivity | Current Impact |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Interest Rates | Medium | Higher rates increase debt service cost on $5.5B Merus debt |
| Recession | Low | Oncology drugs are non-discretionary |
| Inflation | Low | Drug pricing power intact (biologics) |
| USD Strength | Medium | Danish company reporting in USD; DKK/USD moves affect ADR |
| Drug Pricing Regulation (IRA) | Medium | Darzalex could be selected for Medicare price negotiation |

**Fit with World View:** The macro environment is neutral for GMAB. Healthcare/biotech is defensive in a late-cycle environment. The main risks are company-specific (pipeline, patent cliff), not macro-driven. DXY weakness ($96.8) is slightly unfavorable for USD-denominated royalty receipts when converted to DKK for operations.

---

## Veredicto: WATCHLIST

**NOT a BUY at $29.59.** MoS of 21.6% is insufficient for a Tier B biotech with dual risks (patent cliff + pipeline execution). The bear case (-25.6% loss) is unacceptable at current sizing.

**Entry price: $24-26** (28-33% MoS vs base FV $36).

**Reasoning:**
1. QS adjusted to 65 (Tier B), NOT the tool's 77 (Tier A). The headline financials mask forward deterioration.
2. The Merus acquisition transforms the risk profile: from a net-cash royalty collector to a leveraged biotech betting on pipeline execution.
3. The patent cliff is real and material (64% of revenue at risk within 5 years).
4. The pipeline has legitimate potential (EPKINLY +74%, Rina-S BTD, petosemtamab 2 BTDs) but all must execute simultaneously.
5. Precedents: We rejected DSY.PA at 10% MoS for Tier B (entry EUR 15.50 with ~20% MoS). GMAB at 21.6% is borderline but the risk profile (binary pipeline outcomes + patent cliff) demands more cushion than a stable industrial software company.

**Standing Order:** Set at $25 (MoS 30.6% vs base FV $36). Valid until petosemtamab Phase 3 readout (H2 2026).

## META-REFLECTION

### Incertidumbres/Dudas

1. **Post-Merus balance sheet is the biggest uncertainty.** The Merus deal closed Dec 2025, but the full impact on the balance sheet (goodwill, debt service, integration costs) will only be visible in the FY2025 annual report (expected Feb 2026). The DCF tool uses pre-Merus data, which materially overstates equity value.

2. **Darzalex royalty rate is opaque.** The exact royalty rate is not publicly disclosed (referenced as "up to 20%"). I estimated ~17% effective rate ($2.5B royalties on $14.4B sales). If the rate is lower (e.g., 12% after subcutaneous adjustments and Halozyme pass-through), the revenue base is lower than modeled.

3. **EPKINLY competitive dynamics are uncertain.** Roche's glofitamab and BMS's CAR-T therapies compete in the same lymphoma space. I assumed $1.6B peak sales, but this could be $800M-2.5B depending on head-to-head data and label breadth.

4. **The QS Tool's 77 score is genuinely misleading for this company.** The trailing financials look like a Tier A compounder, but the forward profile is a leveraged biotech in transition. The -12 adjustment to 65 is my best judgment, but the true forward QS could be 55-70 depending on pipeline outcomes.

### Sugerencias de Mejora

1. **DCF tool should accept manual net debt override.** For companies with material post-reporting-period acquisitions (like Merus closing Dec 2025), the tool's automatic net debt from yfinance is stale. A `--net-debt` flag would allow accurate post-deal modeling.

2. **quality_scorer.py should flag "transition risk" for companies with >50% revenue from a single product/patent with expiry within 5 years.** GMAB's 64% Darzalex dependency should trigger a warning.

3. **Pharma-specific valuation: SOTP with risk-adjusted pipeline should be a standard method in valuation-methods skill.** For biotech companies, standard DCF/EV-EBIT methods systematically undervalue pipeline optionality or overvalue declining franchises.

### Anomalias Detectadas

1. **QS Tool reports 0% insider ownership, but CEO Jan van de Winkel owns 1.07% ($201M).** The yfinance data may not capture insider holdings accurately for Danish companies with US ADRs. This is a data quality issue.

2. **The tool's WACC calculation shows Kd=11.8%, which is unrealistically high.** This may be an artifact of low total debt pre-Merus (interest expense on a small debt base appears high as a percentage). Post-Merus, the actual cost of debt should be ~5-6% for investment-grade non-convertible debt.

3. **Gross margin declining from 100% to 95.4% scored as "Declining" (-5 points in growth quality), but this decline is EXPECTED and HEALTHY** -- it reflects the transition from pure royalties to own products. The tool penalizes what is actually a strategic positive (diversification away from dependency).

### Preguntas para Orchestrator

1. Should we add GMAB to the quality_universe.yaml despite the adjusted QS of 65 (below the 65 threshold for the universe)? It is borderline and could re-qualify if pipeline executes.

2. Given the post-Merus balance sheet transformation, should this be classified as a "special situation" (Tier C treatment with higher MoS required) rather than standard Tier B?

3. The pharma-healthcare sector view currently tracks NVO, UHS, GSK.L, HIK.L. Should GMAB be added to the watchlist there with the $25 entry price?
