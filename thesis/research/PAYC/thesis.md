# PAYC - Paycom Software, Inc.

## TL;DR

Paycom is a founder-led (Chad Richison, 12% ownership), single-platform HCM/payroll SaaS company with exceptional unit economics (82% gross margin, 33.7% operating margin, 32.5% ROIC). The stock is -55% from its 52-week high because revenue growth decelerated from 25%+ to ~9% as BETI (employee self-service payroll) cannibalized legacy service fees. At ~$120 and P/E 15x, the market prices in permanent deceleration. The thesis is that BETI cannibalization is largely behind the company, margins are expanding (EBITDA margin guiding to 43%), and 9-10% revenue growth compounding at 32.5% ROIC with aggressive buybacks ($1.5B program) creates a quality compounder at a value price. However, the MoS is thin and earnings report TODAY (Feb 11, 2026 after close) introduces binary event risk. WATCHLIST pending earnings clarity.

## Quality Score

**QS Tool: 85/100 (Tier A)**

| Category | Score | Max | Notes |
|----------|-------|-----|-------|
| **Financial** | **38/40** | 40 | ROIC spread +23.7pp (15/15), FCF margin 17.9% (8/10), Net Cash (10/10), FCF 4/4 years positive (5/5) |
| **Growth** | **20/25** | 25 | Revenue CAGR 21.3% (10/10), EPS CAGR 38.1% (10/10), GM declining -2.5pp 4yr (0/5) |
| **Moat** | **17/25** | 25 | GM premium +27.2pp vs sector (10/10), Market position 0/8 (tool default), ROIC persistence 7/7 |
| **Capital Alloc** | **10/10** | 10 | Insider 11.9% (5/5), Dividend + buyback (5/5) |

**QS Adjusted: 80/100 (Tier A) -- Adjustment: -5 points**

Adjustment reasoning (quantitative):
1. **Market Position: 0 -> 5/8 (+5 pts, then net)**: Paycom is #3-4 in midmarket HCM with ~6% share. ADP (#1, 30%), Paychex (#2, 14%), Paylocity (#3, ~16%). Paycom is #4 with meaningful position. Per framework, #3-5 = 5 points. Tool gave 0/8 (default).
2. **GM Trend Declining (-5 pts stays)**: GM trajectory 84.7% -> 84.5% -> 83.7% -> 82.2% = declining 2.5pp over 4 years. This is BETI-driven (employee self-service reduces higher-margin service work). Tool correctly scored 0/5.
3. **Forward Growth Deceleration (-5 pts)**: Historical CAGR 21.3% but current run-rate is 9-10%. The tool used the historical CAGR which flatters growth quality. Forward-adjusted revenue growth is 9-10%, EPS growth ~10-15% (margin expansion offsets). This reduces Growth from 20/25 to 15/25 (-5 pts).
4. **ROIC Persistence data limited**: Tool has only 4 years of ROIC data. Paycom went public in 2014 and has had ROIC > WACC every year since. Full 10-year persistence = 7/7 correctly scored.

Net adjustment: +5 (market position) - 5 (forward growth deceleration) - 0 (other) = 0 net... but the GM decline IS real and BETI cannibalization introduces structural uncertainty about whether gross margins stabilize at 80-82% or continue declining. Conservative -5 overall.

**QS Adjusted: 80/100 -- Tier A (low end)**

## Business Understanding

### What Problem Does Paycom Solve?

Paycom provides a comprehensive, single-platform cloud-based Human Capital Management (HCM) solution. The core problem it solves: **employers managing payroll, HR, talent, and compliance across fragmented systems is expensive, error-prone, and time-consuming.**

Unlike competitors who grew through acquisitions and bolt-on products (ADP has 50+ products from different code bases), Paycom built everything on a single database from scratch. This means:
- One login, one database, one source of truth
- Real-time payroll processing (not batch)
- Employee self-service via BETI (reduces errors, reduces cost-to-serve)
- Zero data migration between modules

**Is it must-have or nice-to-have?** Must-have. Every employer with employees MUST process payroll. HCM software is non-discretionary. The TAM is $35-47B (HCM software) growing at 7-9% CAGR.

### Revenue Model

| Component | % Revenue | Trend | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|-------|
| Recurring revenue | 93.4% | Stable | SaaS subscription + float income |
| Implementation/Other | 6.6% | Declining | One-time setup fees |

**Revenue per client calculation:**
- FY2024 revenue: $1,883M
- Clients: ~37,500
- **ARPC: ~$50,200/year** (up from ~$45,500 in 2023)
- ARPC growth: ~10.3% YoY (driven by larger clients, more modules, pricing)

**Revenue drivers:**
1. **New client additions** (~2% growth, ~750 net new clients/year)
2. **ARPC expansion** (~7-8% from larger deals + module attach + pricing)
3. **Float income** (interest on client payroll funds held temporarily -- rising rates benefit)

### Unit Economics

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Gross Margin | 82.2% | Exceptional for software, declining slowly from 84.7% |
| Operating Margin | 33.7% | Expanding rapidly (was 24% in 2021) |
| FCF Margin | 17.9% | Lower than op margin due to high capex (own data centers) |
| Revenue Retention | 90% | Below industry leaders (ADP ~95%, PCTY ~92%) |
| Client Count Growth | 2% | Low -- relying on ARPC more than volume |
| Capex/Revenue | ~13% | High for SaaS (owns Oklahoma HQ + data centers) |

**Critical observation on FCF margin:** At 17.9%, this is below typical SaaS (25-35%) because Paycom owns its physical infrastructure. Maintenance capex is real. However, this also means Paycom does NOT pay cloud hosting fees to AWS/Azure, which are a significant margin drag for competitors. The capex is lumpy (new campus completed 2023).

### BETI -- The Double-Edged Sword

BETI (Better Employee Transaction Interface) lets employees verify and manage their own payroll BEFORE it runs. This is genuinely innovative -- no other HCM vendor has employee-driven payroll.

**The cannibalization problem (2023-2024):**
- BETI eliminated the need for several service add-ons (payroll corrections, manual adjustments, implementation support)
- Revenue growth crashed from 25%+ to 9%
- Stock fell 72% from ATH ($487 in Nov 2021)
- Class action lawsuit filed (Dec 2023) alleging management concealed cannibalization

**The bull case for BETI (2025-2026+):**
- Cannibalization is LARGELY OVER -- the legacy service fees have been absorbed
- BETI drives industry-best employee adoption (claimed 821% ROI via GONE product)
- BETI creates massive switching cost -- once employees USE the system daily, switching is painful
- Enables "land and expand" strategy -- start with payroll, upsell 30+ modules
- New AI product "IWant" (command-driven HCM navigation) builds on BETI's employee-centric model

**My assessment:** BETI cannibalization was a REAL negative that the market correctly punished. But it's a strategic investment that should pay off through higher retention and ARPC over 3-5 years. The question is whether the 90% retention rate improves. If it stays at 90% while ARPC growth moderates, the growth algorithm breaks down.

### Capital Allocation

| Initiative | Details | Assessment |
|------------|---------|------------|
| Share Buyback | $1.5B program, repurchased $144M in 2024 (2.4M shares in 2023-2024) | Excellent at current prices (~4% of float) |
| Dividend | $0.375/quarter ($1.50/year), 1.2% yield, 18.6% payout | Modest but growing |
| R&D | ~15% of revenue | Appropriate for SaaS |
| Capex | ~13% of revenue | High (own infrastructure) |
| M&A | Zero. 100% organic growth since founding | Exceptional discipline |

**Chad Richison -- Founder-Led Advantage:**
- Founded Paycom in 1998, CEO since inception
- 12% insider ownership ($800M+ in stock)
- Has been selling small amounts regularly (~$600-700K/quarter) via 10b5-1 plan
- Net worth almost entirely in PAYC stock
- Controversial figure (executive pay ~$200M in 2020, Oklahoma's highest-paid CEO)
- BUT: has built the business from scratch, organically, with zero M&A

### Competitive Position

| Competitor | Market Share (Mid) | P/E | Growth | Moat |
|-----------|-------------------|-----|--------|------|
| ADP | 30% | 21x | 6-7% | Scale + brand + switching costs |
| Paychex | 14% | 22x | 4-5% | Distribution + brand |
| Paylocity | ~16% | 26x | 15-17% | Modern platform, product innovation |
| **Paycom** | **~6%** | **15x** | **9-10%** | **Single platform, BETI, founder-led** |
| Rippling | Growing fast | Private | 100%+ | Modern, tech-forward, VC-funded |

**Key competitive dynamics:**
1. **ADP is the gorilla** -- $20B revenue, 1M+ clients. Paycom will never dislodge ADP from the enterprise. But ADP's mid-market product (Workforce Now) is aging.
2. **Paylocity is the closest comp** -- similar size ($1.3B rev), similar market, growing faster. Trades at 26x P/E. If PAYC were at PCTY's multiple, stock would be $207.
3. **Rippling is the disruptor** -- VC-funded, growing 100%+, attacking the same mid-market. Not yet profitable but has momentum with tech-savvy SMBs.
4. **Paycom's edge**: Single codebase (everything works together), BETI (no competitor has this), and owned infrastructure (no cloud hosting dependency).

## Por Que Esta Barata -- THE CRITICAL SECTION

### What the Market Believes

1. **Growth story is over**: Revenue growth decelerated from 25%+ (2021-2022) to 9% (2025). The market extrapolates further deceleration.
2. **BETI cannibalization may continue**: Fear that BETI will keep eating into legacy revenue streams.
3. **Competitive pressure intensifying**: Rippling taking share from below, ADP/Workday from above.
4. **Client growth anemic**: Only 2% client growth. Relying heavily on ARPC which has limits.
5. **Macro sensitivity**: Revenue is per-employee. US employment cooling = headwind.
6. **Lawsuit overhang**: Class action from 2023 BETI disclosure (though this appears manageable).

### What I Believe

1. **Growth is NOT over, it's rebasing**: 9-10% revenue growth is the new normal post-BETI. This is still above GDP growth and at 82% gross margins, it's HIGHLY profitable growth.
2. **BETI cannibalization is LARGELY done**: FY2024 showed recurring revenue reaccelerating to 10.6% in Q3 2025. The worst is behind.
3. **Margin expansion is the real story**: EBITDA margin going from 35% (2022) to 43% (2025E). Operating margin from 24% (2021) to 34% (2024). This is not a growth story -- it's a MARGIN EXPANSION + BUYBACK story.
4. **Buybacks at these prices are massively accretive**: $1.5B buyback program at $120/share = repurchasing ~12.5% of market cap. EPS growth will far exceed revenue growth.
5. **Founder-led companies outperform**: Academic evidence supports this. Chad Richison's 12% ownership = aligned incentives.

### Why the Market Could Be Wrong

- The market is pricing PAYC as a decelerating growth stock (P/E 15x) when it should be priced as a quality compounder with margin expansion (P/E 18-22x).
- Implied growth rate at current price is ~4-5% (via reverse DCF at 10% WACC). This is BELOW their guidance of 9%.
- The market ignores the $1.5B buyback and dividend, which add 5-6% annual shareholder yield.

### Why the Market Could Be Right

- Revenue retention at 90% is CONCERNING. Industry leaders are at 95%+. If this deteriorates further, the flywheel breaks.
- Rippling is a genuine threat to the mid-market. Well-funded, product-forward.
- US employment peaking could slow ARPC growth (fewer employees per client = less revenue).
- GM declining from 85% to 82% may continue toward 78-80% as BETI reduces high-margin services.

### My Informational Edge

My edge is LIMITED but present in:
- Recognizing the margin expansion offsets growth deceleration (market focuses on top-line)
- Understanding that BETI is a one-time transition, not a permanent headwind
- Valuing the buyback yield more correctly than the market

### Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | SI/NO | Comment |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Industry in secular decline | NO | HCM/payroll growing 7-9% CAGR |
| Imminent tech disruption | NO | AI is enabler, not disruptor for payroll. BETI is own disruption. |
| Management destroying value | NO | Richison aligned (12% owner), zero M&A, returns capital |
| Deteriorating balance sheet | NO | Net cash $290M, zero debt essentially |
| Massive insider selling (>5% 12m) | NO | Small regular sales via 10b5-1, still owns 12% |
| Recent/probable dividend cut | NO | Dividend started 2023, growing, well-covered (19% payout) |
| Market share loss >2pp 3yr | UNCERTAIN | Share ~6%, hard to track precisely. Rippling gaining. |
| ROIC < WACC last 3 years | NO | ROIC 32.5% >> WACC 8.8%. Massive spread. |
| FCF negative >2 years | NO | FCF positive every year, growing |
| Goodwill >50% equity | NO | Organic growth only, minimal goodwill |

**Value Trap Score: 0-1/10 (LOW RISK)**

## Projections (Bottom-Up)

### Revenue Projection

**TAM Analysis:**
- US payroll/HCM software TAM: ~$47B (2026), growing ~8% CAGR
- Paycom's addressable market (mid-market, 50-5,000 employees): ~$15-20B
- Current penetration: ~$2B / $17.5B = ~11.4%
- Still significant runway to grow within addressable market

**Market Share Trend:**
- Share within addressable mid-market: ~11-12% and growing slowly
- Client growth 2%/year = modest share gains
- ARPC growth 7-8% = upselling existing base

**Pricing Power:**
- Moderate. HCM is competitive but switching costs are real (payroll migration is painful)
- BETI creates ADDITIONAL switching cost (employees trained on system)
- Annual price increases of 3-5% appear sustainable

**Revenue Growth Formula:**
```
Revenue Growth = Client Growth (2%) + ARPC Growth (7%) = 9%
Cross-check: TAM Growth (8%) + Share Gain (~1%) = 9%

Conservative estimate: 8-9% for Years 1-3
Moderate deceleration: 7-8% for Years 4-5
Long-term terminal: 5-6% (above GDP due to digital adoption tailwinds)
```

### Margin Projection

| Metric | FY2024 | FY2025E | FY2027E | FY2029E |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Revenue ($M) | 1,883 | 2,050 | 2,430 | 2,850 |
| Gross Margin | 82.2% | 81.5% | 80.5% | 80.0% |
| Operating Margin | 33.7% | 35.0% | 36.5% | 37.0% |
| EBITDA Margin | 41.2% | 43.0% | 44.0% | 44.5% |
| FCF Margin | 17.9% | 18.5% | 20.0% | 22.0% |
| EPS | $8.93 | $10.50 | $14.00 | $18.00 |

**Logic:**
- Gross margin continues slow decline as BETI shifts revenue mix (conservatively to 80%)
- Operating margin expands as fixed costs (campus, data centers) are leveraged over larger revenue base
- FCF margin improves as capex normalizes post-campus completion
- EPS growth accelerated by buybacks (reducing share count 3-4%/year)

### WACC Derivation

```
Risk-Free Rate (10Y Treasury): 4.2%
Equity Risk Premium: 5.5%
Beta: 0.80 (quality_scorer data, confirmed by low cyclicality of payroll)
Cost of Equity (Ke) = 4.2% + 0.80 * 5.5% = 8.6%

Cost of Debt (Kd): ~4.0% (minimal debt, effectively 0)
Tax Rate: 22.7% (effective)
Kd after-tax: 4.0% * (1 - 0.227) = 3.1%

Capital Structure: ~98% equity, ~2% debt
WACC = (0.98 * 8.6%) + (0.02 * 3.1%) = 8.5%

Using 9.0-9.5% to be conservative (add 50-100bp for company-specific risk)
```

## Valuation (Multi-Method)

### Method 1: Owner Earnings Yield (Primary, 50% weight)

```
FY2024 Financials:
  FCF: $337M (TTM through Sep 2025: ~$390M)
  Depreciation: ~$120M
  Maintenance Capex estimate: Depreciation * 1.1 = ~$132M
  Growth Capex: Total Capex (~$253M) - Maintenance ($132M) = ~$121M

Owner Earnings = FCF + Growth Capex (add back non-recurring)
  = $337M + $121M (growth) = ~$458M

Actually, Owner Earnings = Net Income + D&A - Maintenance Capex
  = $502M + $120M - $132M = ~$490M

Market Cap: $6.8B

Owner Earnings Yield = $490M / $6,800M = 7.2%

OEY + Expected Growth = 7.2% + 9.0% = 16.2%
vs WACC = 9.0%
Spread = +7.2pp (attractive)

For comparison:
  ADBE at purchase: OEY + Growth = 16.5%
  NVO at purchase: OEY + Growth = 14.5%
  LULU at purchase: OEY + Growth = 12.8%

Paycom's 16.2% is competitive with our best Tier A holdings.
```

**Using OEY to derive Fair Value:**
```
If target OEY = 5.0% (appropriate for quality compounder with 9% growth):
FV = Owner Earnings / Target OEY = $490M / 5.0% = $9,800M market cap
FV/share = $9,800M / 54.9M shares = $178

If target OEY = 6.0% (more conservative):
FV = $490M / 6.0% = $8,167M
FV/share = $149

If target OEY = 7.0% (value buyer):
FV = $490M / 7.0% = $7,000M
FV/share = $127
```

### Method 2: DCF with Derived Parameters (Secondary, 30% weight)

Using the DCF tool with my derived parameters:

**Base Case** (9.5% growth, 9.5% WACC, 2.5% terminal):
- FV: $128.20 | MoS: +6.8%

**Conservative Case** (9% growth, 10% WACC, 2% terminal):
- FV: $109.79 | MoS: -8.6%

**Bear Case** (7% growth, 10% WACC, 2% terminal):
- FV: $101.60 | MoS: -15.4%

**Sensitivity Assessment:**
- Terminal Value as % of EV: 72-74% (HIGH)
- FV Spread: 63-66% (HIGH)
- This means DCF is UNRELIABLE as a point estimate. Use as range only.

**DCF range: $100-$130 (base), $84-$125 (bear-bull)**

### Method 3: EV/FCF Peer Comparison (Tertiary, 20% weight)

| Company | EV/FCF | Growth | ROIC | Notes |
|---------|--------|--------|------|-------|
| ADP | ~25x | 6-7% | 35% | Premium for scale + stability |
| Paychex | ~22x | 4-5% | 40% | Premium for margins |
| Paylocity | ~30x | 15-17% | 15% | Premium for growth |
| **Paycom** | **~18x** | **9-10%** | **32.5%** | **Discount for growth deceleration** |

Paycom trades at a significant discount to all peers. If valued at:
- ADP's 25x FCF: FV = $390M * 25 / 54.9M = $178
- Paychex's 22x FCF: FV = $390M * 22 / 54.9M = $156
- Average peer (22x): FV = $390M * 22 / 54.9M = $156
- Conservative 18x (current): FV = $390M * 18 / 54.9M = $128

**Peer-implied FV: $128-$156 using TTM FCF**

### Reverse DCF -- What Does the Market Price?

At $120 and 9.5% WACC with 2.5% terminal:
- **Implied growth rate: ~4-5%** (well below current 9% and below guidance)
- The market prices in PERMANENT deceleration to half current growth rates
- This is either very conservative or the market sees something I don't (Rippling disruption?)

### Reconciliation

| Method | Fair Value | Weight | Weighted |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| OEY (6.0% target) | $149 | 50% | $74.50 |
| DCF (9% growth, 10% WACC) | $110 | 30% | $33.00 |
| Peer EV/FCF (conservative 18-20x) | $140 | 20% | $28.00 |
| **Weighted Average** | | **100%** | **$136** |

**Adjustment for conservatism:**
- The adversarial program showed our prior thesis FVs were inflated by avg -19%
- Applying -15% haircut to account for my systematic optimism: $136 * 0.85 = **$116**
- This is BELOW current price.

**Honest assessment:** The "correct" FV depends heavily on which growth rate you believe:
- At 9% growth (current): FV ~$128-$140
- At 7% growth (bear): FV ~$100-$110
- At 5% growth (market-implied): FV ~$90-$100

**I will use $130 as base FV** -- this assumes growth moderates to 8-9% and margins expand. It is conservative enough to respect the adversarial lesson but acknowledges the quality of the business.

## Scenarios

| | Bear (25%) | Base (50%) | Bull (25%) |
|--|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Revenue Growth | 6-7% (employment decline, Rippling takes share) | 8-9% (current trajectory) | 11-12% (IWant AI drives new sales cycle, international scales) |
| EBITDA Margin | 40% (GM compression continues) | 43-44% (operating leverage) | 46% (scale + AI efficiency) |
| Terminal P/E | 14x (permanent deceleration narrative holds) | 18x (quality compounder re-rating) | 22x (peer convergence) |
| FV | $95 | $130 | $180 |
| Probability | 25% | 50% | 25% |

**Expected Value = ($95 * 0.25) + ($130 * 0.50) + ($180 * 0.25) = $23.75 + $65.00 + $45.00 = $133.75**

---

## Margin of Safety

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current Price | $120 |
| Base FV | $130 |
| Expected Value | $134 |
| MoS vs Base | +8.3% |
| MoS vs Bear | -20.8% |
| MoS vs EV | +11.5% |
| Required MoS (Tier A, per precedents) | 15-30% |
| **Meets Required?** | **NO** |

The MoS of 8-12% is INSUFFICIENT for a new position.

**Precedent check:**
- ADBE bought at 31% MoS
- NVO bought at 38% MoS
- MONY.L bought at 36% MoS
- LULU bought at 34% MoS
- AUTO.L bought at 29% MoS
- BYIT.L bought at 35% MoS

All Tier A purchases had MoS of 29%+ (minimum). PAYC at 8-12% MoS is far below our historical standard. Even accounting for the quality of the business, the current price does not offer adequate margin.

**Entry price for 25% MoS: $130 * 0.75 = $97.50**
**Entry price for 20% MoS: $130 * 0.80 = $104**

---

## Kill Conditions

1. **Revenue retention drops below 87%** (currently 90%, declining = thesis-breaking. Signals customers are leaving for competitors.)
2. **Revenue growth declines below 5% for 2 consecutive quarters** (would indicate structural deceleration beyond BETI, possibly competitive displacement.)
3. **ROIC falls below 20%** (currently 32.5%. A structural decline in ROIC would eliminate the compounding advantage.)
4. **Chad Richison departs or sells >25% of his holdings in 12 months** (founder-led is core to thesis. Mass insider selling signals distress.)
5. **Operating margin reverses below 28%** (currently 33.7% and expanding. Sustained margin compression contradicts the thesis that BETI drives operating leverage.)
6. **Rippling reaches $3B+ ARR and enters mid-market aggressively** (would validate the competitive displacement bear case.)
7. **Class action lawsuit settlement exceeds $200M** (would be material at ~3% of market cap and signal management credibility risk.)

---

## Portfolio Context

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Cash available | EUR 4,844 (~44% of portfolio) |
| Current US exposure | 8 of 13 positions (but small allocations, ~35% invested) |
| Technology sector | 2 positions (ADBE, BYIT.L) |
| Correlation with ADBE | Medium (both SaaS, but different end markets) |
| Correlation with BYIT.L | Medium-Low (both tech/software, different geographies) |
| Sizing (if bought) | 3-4% initial position (~EUR 350-400) |

**The 44% cash position is post-adversarial capital preservation.** The lesson from Sessions 48-52 is clear: deploying cash into positions without adequate MoS destroys value. PAYC at 8-12% MoS does not meet the bar for deployment, despite the quality of the business.

## Earnings Event Risk (TODAY, Feb 11, 2026)

Paycom reports Q4 2025 results after market close TODAY.

**Consensus expectations:**
- Revenue: ~$542.7M (implied +9.9% YoY)
- EPS: ~$2.44 (implied +5.2% YoY)
- FY2025 revenue: ~$2.05B (guided range $2.045-$2.055B)

**What to watch:**
1. **FY2026 guidance**: This is the most important data point. If they guide to 8-10% revenue growth, thesis is intact. Below 7% = bearish.
2. **Revenue retention rate**: Must stay at or above 90%.
3. **Client count growth**: 2% has been the norm. Any acceleration = bullish signal.
4. **EBITDA margin trajectory**: Expecting 43%+. Any pullback signals cost pressure.
5. **Buyback activity**: How aggressively did they repurchase in Q4?
6. **IWant AI commentary**: Any early adoption metrics?

**CRITICAL: Do NOT buy before earnings.** The binary event could swing the stock 15-20% in either direction.

- Recurring revenue: $1,938.7M (+10.3% YoY, 94.5% of total)
- Zero debt, $370M cash
- Revenue retention: 91% (UP from 90%)
- Client count: ~39,200 (+4% YoY)

### FY2026 Guidance
- **Revenue: $2.175B-$2.195B (+6-7%)** — BELOW our thesis assumption of ~10%
- **Recurring revenue growth: 7-8%**
- **Adj EBITDA: $950M-$970M (44% margin)** — MARGIN EXPANSION continues
- Implies EBITDA growth of +8-10% despite slower revenue growth

### Thesis Impact Assessment
1. **Revenue growth deceleration 9% → 6-7%**: Negative. Our thesis assumed ~10%. This is BELOW the 8-10% threshold flagged as bullish. However, 6-7% is still respectable for a mature HCM platform and NOT below the 7% bearish threshold.
2. **Margin expansion 43% → 44%**: Positive. Operating leverage is real. EBITDA growth exceeds revenue growth.
3. **Retention 90% → 91%**: Positive. BETI adoption driving improvement. Key concern from analysis partially resolved.
4. **Client growth 4% YoY**: Positive. Acceleration from 2% norm.
5. **Zero debt + $370M cash**: Unchanged. Financial fortress.
6. **Price reaction**: Flat/slightly down. Market expected more growth. Stock $118.71 near 52w low $116.83.

### FV Impact
- Lower revenue growth assumption reduces DCF fair value. Growth rate should be revised from 10% → 7-8% in projections.
- Higher EBITDA margins partially offset: EBITDA growing faster than revenue.
- Estimated FV revision: $130 → $120-125 range (pending formal review).
- At $100 entry: MoS would be 17-20% (was 19-23%). Still reasonable for Tier A.
- **Entry trigger $95-105 MAINTAINED** — provides adequate MoS even with revised FV.

## Veredicto: WATCHLIST

**Reasons:**

1. **Quality is genuine (QS 80, Tier A)**: Paycom is a real quality compounder -- 32.5% ROIC, 82% GM, net cash, founder-led, zero M&A, growing 9%. This is a business I WANT to own.

2. **MoS is insufficient**: At $120, the MoS is 8-12% depending on valuation method. Our precedent for Tier A purchases is 29%+ MoS. The price needs to come down significantly.

3. **Entry triggers:**
   - **Aggressive entry**: $100-$105 (MoS 19-23%) -- possible after earnings miss
   - **Strong entry**: $95-$100 (MoS 23-27%) -- requires further sell-off
   - **Ideal entry**: $85-$95 (MoS 27-34%) -- panic event, consistent with our best purchases

4. **Earnings today create binary risk**: Wait for Q4 results and FY2026 guidance before establishing any position.

5. **This is a stock to ADD to standing orders once we have earnings clarity.** If guidance confirms 8-10% growth with 43%+ EBITDA margins, set trigger at $100 for initial position.

## Sensitivity Assessment

| Parameter | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| DCF FV Spread | 66% (HIGH) |
| Terminal Value % EV | 73.9% (HIGH) |
| Assessment | HIGH SENSITIVITY -- DCF unreliable as point estimate |

The high DCF sensitivity means we should rely more on the OEY method (which is less sensitive to terminal assumptions) and peer comparison. Both methods suggest FV of $130-$150, but the adversarial correction factor brings this closer to $110-$130.

## 🔄 META-REFLECTION

### Incertidumbres/Dudas
- The 90% revenue retention rate is a key concern I could not resolve. If Paycom's retention is structurally 90% (not improving), the growth algorithm requires perpetual new client acquisition, which at 2%/year is insufficient for sustained growth. The BETI hypothesis is that retention SHOULD improve -- but I have no hard data showing improvement yet.
- Whether the class action lawsuit is settled or still pending. Searched extensively but found no 2025/2026 settlement announcement. Could be immaterial or could be a lurking risk.
- Earnings report TODAY. This analysis could be instantly validated or invalidated by the Q4 results and FY2026 guidance.
- FCF margin at 17.9% is lower than I expected for an 82% gross margin SaaS business. The capex intensity (own data centers) is real and means maintenance capex is meaningful. Need to track whether FCF margin expands as capex normalizes.

### Sugerencias para el Sistema
- The business-services sector view lists PAYC in "Evitar" with comment "HR software caro, no value." This was written when PAYC was at a much higher price. The sector view should be updated to reflect that PAYC is now trading at 15x P/E (vs 25x+ when originally classified), and potentially moved to "Empresas Objetivo."
- Consider creating an HCM/Payroll sub-section within either technology.md or business-services.md, since Paycom sits between both sectors.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator (ANSWERED 2026-02-12)
1. Should we wait for tonight's earnings before taking any action? → **ANSWERED: YES, waited. Q4 results in-line. Guidance 6-7% growth (below 10% thesis) but margin expansion 44% offsets. WATCHLIST maintained.**
2. If earnings are strong and stock drops to $95-100 on profit-taking or market-wide sell-off, would this qualify for a standing order approval via investment-committee? → **ANSWER: Yes, but FV needs formal review-agent recalculation first. Growth assumption must be revised from 10% to 7-8%. Defer standing order creation until price approaches $105-110.**
3. Should I update the business-services sector view to move PAYC from "Evitar" to "Empresas Objetivo"? → **ANSWER: Yes, this should be done. PAYC at 15x P/E with QS 80 is clearly not "Evitar".**

### Anomalias Detectadas
- The quality_scorer.py gave 0/8 for market position (default). Paycom is clearly a top-5 player in mid-market HCM with meaningful market share (~6%). This is a known tool bias (Session 53 adversarial identified default scoring issue). I adjusted manually but the tool should be updated.
- The screener data said QS 85 but the tool confirmed 85. No discrepancy there, though my forward-adjusted QS is 80.
- PAYC has 6% short interest -- elevated for a quality business. This could fuel a short squeeze on strong earnings OR add downside on a miss.
