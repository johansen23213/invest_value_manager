# General Mills (GIS) - Investment Thesis v2.0

**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Analyst:** Fundamental Analyst Agent
**Status:** WATCHLIST - Insufficient Margin of Safety
**Tier:** B (Quality Score 6.5/10 - requires 25% MoS)

---

## 1. Resumen Ejecutivo

General Mills is a $24.8B consumer staples company (P/E 10x, yield 5.2%) trading 31% below its 52-week high. The company owns iconic brands like Cheerios (#1 US cereal with ~11% market share), Blue Buffalo (#1 natural pet food with >30% share), and Nature Valley. After properly accounting for $13.1B net debt (D/E 1.47x), the multi-method valuation yields a fair value range of $40-54/share.

**Why it is cheap:** (1) GLP-1 drugs reducing food consumption, (2) private label competition accelerating, (3) volumes declining for 3 consecutive years, (4) management investing in volume recovery vs earnings optimization.

**My counter-thesis:** GIS is adapting via protein-focused products (Cheerios Protein, Nature Valley Protein Bars), pet food expansion (Whitebridge $1.45B acquisition), and international growth (+4% organic). The GLP-1 impact is real but manageable and likely priced in at 10x P/E.

**Fair Value:** $45-50 (Base Case), implying 0-7% MoS at current $46.50.
**Entry Price:** $35-38 (25% MoS required for Tier B)
**Verdict: WATCHLIST.** Not cheap enough. Monitor for price drop or evidence of volume stabilization.

## 2. Business Understanding

### 2.1 Modelo de Negocio

| Aspecto | Descripcion |
|---------|-------------|
| Problema que resuelve | Convenient, trusted food for daily consumption - breakfast, snacks, meals, pet food |
| Cliente target | Mass market consumers (81% US), retailers, foodservice operators |
| Como genera ingresos | Consumibles - repeat purchase via retail (grocery), foodservice, e-commerce |
| % ingresos recurrentes | ~95% - daily/weekly consumption patterns |

**Segments:**
- North America Retail (~$11B, 56%): Cheerios, Nature Valley, Betty Crocker, Pillsbury, Old El Paso
- Pet (~$2.6B, 13%): Blue Buffalo - acquired 2018 for $8B
- North America Foodservice (~$2.2B, 11%): 55% cereal share, 51% biscuits
- International (~$3.6B, 20%): Haagen-Dazs, Old El Paso, growing +4% organic

### 2.2 Unit Economics

| Metrica | Valor | Benchmark | Comentario |
|---------|-------|-----------|------------|
| CAC | Low (retail distribution) | N/A | Brand advertising + trade spend drives awareness |
| LTV | High (decades of loyalty) | N/A | Cheerios, Pillsbury multi-generational |
| LTV/CAC | >10x estimated | >3x bueno | Established brands, minimal per-customer acquisition cost |
| Consumer retention | High | N/A | 30% cereal share maintained 5+ years |

**Note:** Traditional CAC/LTV metrics less applicable to CPG. Key metric is market share retention + pricing power.

### 2.3 Estructura de Margenes

| Margen | Actual | 5y Avg | Tendencia | vs Peers |
|--------|--------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Gross | 33.8% | 34.5% | Compressing | In-line (K: 32%, CAG: 27%) |
| Operating | 15-17% | 17% | -0.7%/yr | Above peers (CAG: 13%) |
| Net | 13.5% | 13% | Stable | Above peers |
| FCF | 11-12% | 11% | Stable | In-line |

**5-Year Operating Margin Growth:** -0.7%/year - slight compression from input costs and investment in volume recovery.

### 2.4 Por Que Esta Barata

**Narrativa del mercado:**
1. GLP-1 drugs (Ozempic/Wegovy) reducing food consumption - 1 in 10 Americans now using
2. Private label taking share - 21% US, 40-50% EU
3. Volumes declining 3 consecutive years
4. $13B+ net debt from Blue Buffalo acquisition
5. Management prioritizing investment over EPS - FY26 guided -10-15% adj EPS

**Mi contra-tesis:**

| Mercado cree | Yo creo | Mi evidencia | Prob equivocado |
|--------------|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| GLP-1 will crush food demand | Impact is real but manageable; adapting with protein products | Cheerios Protein to $100M in FY26; "Leaner Consumer" initiative | 30% |
| Private label will steal all share | Premium brands with innovation survive; GIS holds #1/#2 positions | 30% cereal share stable 5 years; Blue Buffalo >30% in natural pet | 25% |
| Debt is dangerous | Coverage 5.6x adequate; FCF ~$2B covers dividend + gradual delever | Interest coverage stable; no near-term maturities | 15% |
| Volumes will keep declining | FY26 investment in "consumer value" may stabilize | Q2 FY26 Cheerios grew dollars AND pounds first time in 3 years | 40% |

### 2.5 Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | SI/NO | Comentario |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Industria en declive secular | PARCIAL | Packaged food flat, but GLP-1 is structural headwind |
| Disrupcion tecnologica inminente | NO | Food is fundamental need |
| Management destruyendo valor | NO | Investing in growth, not extracting |
| Balance deteriorandose | PARCIAL | D/E 1.47x high but stable, not worsening |
| Insider selling masivo | NO | No significant insider sales |
| Dividend cut reciente/probable | NO | 7 consecutive years increase, 52% payout sustainable |
| Perdida market share >2pp/3y | NO | Holding #1/#2 positions in categories |
| ROIC < WACC ultimos 3 anos | NO | ROIC 7-10% vs WACC ~6-8% (positive spread) |
| FCF negativo >2 anos | NO | $2B+ FCF consistently |
| Goodwill >50% equity | SI | ~$14B goodwill on $9.3B equity (Blue Buffalo) |

**Total SI:** 2.5 (partial: secular decline, balance) + 1 (goodwill) = 2.5-3

**Assessment:** BORDERLINE - Not a classic value trap, but not wide-moat quality either. High goodwill is risk if Blue Buffalo underperforms.

## 4. Proyecciones (Projection Framework)

### 4.1 Drivers de Revenue

| Driver | Valor | Fuente |
|--------|-------|--------|
| TAM actual | ~$500B (US packaged food) | Industry data |
| TAM growth | 2-3% nominal | Population + inflation |
| Market share actual | 30% US cereal, ~8% total packaged food | Euromonitor, company data |
| Market share proyectado (5y) | 29-30% (stable to slight loss) | Private label pressure |
| Pricing power | Moderado - can pass inflation but with lag | Post-COVID pricing showed limits |

**Revenue growth derivado:**
- TAM growth: +2%
- Market share: -0.5% (private label pressure)
- Pricing: +1% (inflation pass-through)
- Net: +2.5% nominal, 0% to +1% real
- **FY26 guidance: -1% to +1% organic** (aligns with our estimate)

### 4.2 Proyeccion de Margenes

| Ano | Revenue Growth | Op. Margin | FCF Margin |
|-----|---------------|------------|------------|
| FY25 (actual) | -2% | 16.8% | 11.7% |
| FY26 (guidance) | -1% to +1% | 15-16% | 10-11% |
| FY27E | +1% | 16% | 11% |
| FY28E | +2% | 16.5% | 11.5% |

**Assumptions:** Volume investment pays off FY27+, modest margin recovery from cost savings ($100M+ annual).

### 4.3 WACC Derivado

```
Risk-free: 4.5% (10Y Treasury)
Beta: 0.40 (yfinance) - defensive stock
ERP: 5.5%
Ke = 4.5% + 0.40 * 5.5% = 6.7%

Interest Expense: $524M / Debt $13.7B = 3.8% cost of debt
Tax rate: 22%
Kd after-tax = 3.8% * (1-0.22) = 3.0%

Market Cap: $24.8B | Net Debt: $13.1B | EV: ~$38B
E/V = 65% | D/V = 35%

WACC = (0.65 * 6.7%) + (0.35 * 3.0%) = 4.4% + 1.0% = 5.4%
```

**Sanity check:** 5.4% WACC seems too low for a company with this debt load and structural headwinds. Adjusting to **8.0-8.5%** to reflect execution risk and GLP-1 uncertainty.

## 5. Valoracion Multi-Metodo

### 5.1 Metodo 1: DCF (Primary for Stable Staple)

**Conservative Case (1% growth, 8.5% WACC, 2% terminal):**

| Scenario | FV/Share | MoS% |
|----------|----------|------|
| Bear | $26.88 | -42.2% |
| Base | $40.09 | -13.8% |
| Bull | $58.83 | +26.5% |

**Moderate Case (2% growth, 8.0% WACC, 2.5% terminal):**

| Scenario | FV/Share | MoS% |
|----------|----------|------|
| Bear | $36.30 | -21.9% |
| Base | $53.88 | +15.9% |
| Bull | $80.19 | +72.5% |

**Tool Default (5% growth, 9% WACC, 2.5% terminal):**

| Scenario | FV/Share | MoS% |
|----------|----------|------|
| Bear | $35.53 | -23.6% |
| Base | $50.98 | +9.6% |
| Bull | $72.88 | +56.7% |

### 5.2 Metodo 2: EV/EBIT Normalizado

**Sector multiple:** Consumer Staples 12-16x EBIT
**GIS adjustment:** -2x for high debt, -1x for below-average growth = 10-12x

EBIT FY25: ~$3.3B
- At 10x: EV $33B - $13.1B net debt = **$37/share**
- At 11x: EV $36.3B - $13.1B = **$43/share**
- At 12x: EV $39.6B - $13.1B = **$49/share**

**EV/EBIT Fair Value: $40-45/share**

### 5.3 Escenarios

| Escenario | Prob | Assumptions | FV (DCF) | FV (EV/EBIT) | Blended |
|-----------|------|-------------|----------|--------------|---------|
| Bear | 25% | Volumes -3%/yr, margins compress 200bp, WACC 9.5% | $27 | $35 | $31 |
| Base | 50% | Flat to +1% growth, margins stable, WACC 8.5% | $45 | $43 | $44 |
| Bull | 25% | +2% growth, Blue Buffalo accelerates, WACC 8.0% | $60 | $55 | $58 |

### 5.4 Expected Value y Margen de Seguridad

```
Expected Value = ($31 * 25%) + ($44 * 50%) + ($58 * 25%)
               = $7.75 + $22 + $14.50 = $44.25

Precio actual = $46.50
MoS vs Expected Value = -5% (overvalued vs EV)
MoS vs Bear Case = -50% (significantly overvalued vs bear)
MoS vs Base Case = +5.4% (slightly undervalued vs base)
```

### 5.5 Reconciliacion de Metodos

| Metodo | Fair Value | Peso | Weighted FV |
|--------|-----------|------|-------------|
| DCF Conservative | $40 | 30% | $12.0 |
| DCF Moderate | $54 | 30% | $16.2 |
| EV/EBIT | $43 | 40% | $17.2 |
| **Weighted Average** | | 100% | **$45.4** |

**Conclusion:** Fair value ~$45/share. Current price $46.50 = roughly FAIR VALUE. **Not cheap enough for 25% MoS (would need $34).**

## 6. Moat Assessment

| Aspecto | Evaluacion |
|---------|------------|
| Tipo | **NARROW** |
| Fuentes | Intangibles (brands), Cost advantage (scale), Switching costs (pet food only) |
| Evidencia cuantitativa | ROIC 7-10% vs WACC 5-8% (positive but thin spread); 30% cereal share stable 5yr |
| Durabilidad estimada | 10-15 years |
| Amenazas principales | 1. Private label expansion 2. GLP-1 structural impact 3. Blue Buffalo competition |

**Moat Matrix:**

| Fuente | Presente? | Fortaleza (1-5) | Evidencia | Durabilidad |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Cost Advantage | SI | 3 | Scale in manufacturing, distribution | 15+ years |
| Network Effects | NO | 0 | N/A | N/A |
| Intangibles | SI | 4 | Cheerios 11% share, Blue Buffalo 30% natural pet | 10-20 years |
| Switching Costs | PARCIAL | 2 | Only pet food has meaningful switching | 10 years |
| Efficient Scale | NO | 1 | Market too large, many competitors | N/A |

**Conclusion:** Narrow moat based on brands and scale, but eroding due to private label. NOT wide moat - ROIC spread is thin and declining.

## 7. Riesgos

| Riesgo | Prob | Impacto | Mitigante |
|--------|------|---------|-----------|
| GLP-1 accelerates food demand destruction | Media | Alto | Protein products, smaller portions initiative |
| Private label takes 5pp+ share | Alta | Medio | Innovation, brand investment, premium positioning |
| Blue Buffalo growth stalls | Media | Alto | Whitebridge acquisition, fresh pet food launch |
| Debt becomes problematic if FCF drops | Baja | Alto | 5.6x coverage, no near-term maturities |
| Input cost inflation (wheat, corn) | Media | Medio | Pricing power, hedging |

**Kill Conditions (vender inmediatamente si ocurre):**
1. Dividend cut
2. Interest coverage falls below 3x
3. Two consecutive quarters of organic revenue decline >5%
4. Blue Buffalo loses significant market share to competitors

## 8. Catalizadores

| Catalizador | Timeframe | Prob | Impacto |
|-------------|-----------|------|---------|
| Volume growth turns positive | 6-12m | Media | +15-20% re-rating |
| Debt reduction prioritized over buybacks | 1-2y | Baja | +10% confidence boost |
| GLP-1 impact proves less than feared | 1-2y | Media | +15% sector re-rating |
| Blue Buffalo fresh pet food succeeds | 6-12m | Media | +10% growth premium |
| Fed rate cuts boost yield stocks | 2026-2027 | Media | +10-15% multiple expansion |

---

## 9. Conexion Macro

| Factor Macro | Sensibilidad | Status Actual | Impacto |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|---------|
| Tasas de interes | Media | Estables ~4.5% | Neutral - high yield attractive vs bonds |
| Recesion | Baja | Baja probabilidad US | Defensive - staples outperform in recession |
| Ciclo economico | Baja | Late-cycle | Favorable for defensives |
| Inflacion | Media | 3% PCE | Can pass through with lag |

**Fit con World View:** FAVORABLE - Macro uncertain, geopolitical tensions high. Defensive staples with 5%+ yield provide portfolio ballast. However, GIS not the cleanest staples play (debt, volume issues).

| 5. Macro Context | PASS | Defensive fit with uncertain macro |
| 6. Portfolio Fit | PASS | US geo 29.6%, Consumer Defensive 6.2% post-buy |
| 7. Autocritica | PASS | See below |

**Verdict: FAIL Gate 4.** Stock is fairly valued, not cheap enough. Add to watchlist at $35-38.

---

## 11. Autocritica

| Aspecto | Respuesta |
|---------|-----------|
| Asunciones no validadas | 1. GLP-1 impact magnitude (could be worse) 2. Blue Buffalo moat durability 3. Management's volume investment will work |
| Sesgos posibles | 1. Yield attraction bias (5.2% yield is seductive) 2. Brand familiarity bias (Cheerios is household name) 3. Contrarian bias (stock down 31%) |
| Que me haria cambiar de opinion | 1. Price drops to $35-38 2. Two quarters positive volume growth 3. Debt reduction plan announced 4. GLP-1 users stabilize/decline |
| Mi ventaja informacional | LIMITED - GIS is well-covered (20+ analysts). My edge is patience and price discipline. |
| Que podria estar mal en mi analisis | GLP-1 impact could be more severe than expected. Private label acceleration could be faster. Blue Buffalo could face serious competition. DCF sensitive to growth/WACC assumptions. |
