# General Mills (GIS) - Investment Thesis

**Date:** 2026-02-02 (updated)
**Analyst:** Fundamental Analyst Agent
**Status:** WATCHLIST - Insufficient Margin of Safety
**Current Price:** $45.68 / EUR 38.54
**Tier:** B (Quality Score 6.5/10, requires 25% MoS)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

General Mills is a $24B consumer staples company trading at 9.8x earnings, down 32% from its 52-week high. The 5.3% dividend yield and 10% FCF yield appear attractive on the surface. However, after properly accounting for $13.1B in net debt (D/E 1.47x), the DCF analysis reveals insufficient margin of safety for a Tier B stock. The base case fair value is $35-51/share depending on growth assumptions, meaning the stock ranges from slightly overvalued to modestly undervalued -- but does NOT meet our 25% MoS threshold.

**Verdict: WATCHLIST.** Buy target at $34-38 (25% MoS on conservative base case). Current price does not offer adequate compensation for the debt burden, declining volumes, and GLP-1 secular risk.

## 5. Valuation

### CRITICAL FIX: Net Debt Subtraction
Previous DCF tool was NOT subtracting $13.05B net debt from enterprise value, inflating fair values by ~$24/share. This has been corrected.

### Method 1: DCF Scenarios (default params: 5% growth, 2.5% terminal, 9% WACC)

| Scenario | EV | (-) Net Debt | Equity | FV/Share | MoS% |
|----------|----|-----------| -------|----------|------|
| Bear | $32.0B | $13.1B | $19.0B | $35.53 | -22.2% |
| Base | $40.3B | $13.1B | $27.2B | $50.98 | +11.6% |
| Bull | $51.9B | $13.1B | $38.9B | $72.88 | +59.5% |

### Method 2: Conservative DCF (1% growth, 2% terminal, 9% WACC)
More appropriate for a company with -5.8% historical FCF CAGR:

| Scenario | FV/Share | MoS% |
|----------|----------|------|
| Bear | $23.73 | -48.0% |
| Base | $35.51 | -22.3% |
| Bull | $51.86 | +13.5% |

### Method 3: EV/EBITDA Comparables

| Peer | P/E | EV/EBITDA |
|------|-----|-----------|
| GIS | 9.8x | ~10.7x |
| CAG (Conagra) | N/A | ~10x |
| CPB (Campbell's) | 13.9x | ~11x |
| KHC (Kraft Heinz) | N/A | ~10x |

At 10-11x EBITDA: EV $35-39B, minus $13B net debt = Equity $22-26B = **$42-49/share**

### Method 4: FCF Yield

| Target FCF Yield | Implied Price |
|------------------|---------------|
| 8% | $58 |
| 10% (current) | $47 |
| 12% | $39 |

### Valuation Summary

| Method | Conservative | Base | Optimistic |
|--------|-------------|------|------------|
| DCF (conservative) | $24 | $36 | $52 |
| DCF (default) | $36 | $51 | $73 |
| EV/EBITDA Comps | $42 | $45 | $49 |
| FCF Yield | $39 | $47 | $58 |

**Probability-weighted fair value: $41-48/share**
**MoS at $45.68: approximately 0% to +5%**
**Price for 25% MoS (Tier B): $31-36**

The stock is approximately FAIRLY VALUED. Not cheap enough for our criteria.

## 6. Moat Assessment: NARROW MOAT

**Positive:**
1. Brand portfolio: Cheerios (#1 US cereal, ~30% market share), Blue Buffalo (#1 natural pet food), Haagen-Dazs, Nature Valley
2. Distribution/shelf space: Decades of retailer relationships, 55% foodservice cereal share
3. Scale: $19B revenue enables marketing spend smaller players cannot match
4. Pet food: Blue Buffalo has genuine switching costs (pet owners reluctant to change)

**Negative:**
1. No pricing power: Post-COVID pricing backlash, consumers trading to private label
2. Low switching costs: Most products easily substitutable
3. GLP-1 secular headwind: Ozempic/Wegovy reducing food consumption
4. Private label gaining share in every GIS category

**Moat Score: 5/10 -- Narrow, sufficient for survival but not for sustained above-average returns.**

## 7. Quality Score (Tier Assessment)

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| 1. ROE >15% (5yr) | 1/1 | 27% but leverage-inflated |
| 2. FCF positive 5yr | 1/1 | $2.1-2.8B consistently |
| 3. D/E <1.0 | 0/1 | **FAILS**: 1.47x |
| 4. Dividend 10+ yr uncut | 1/1 | Paying since 1985 |
| 5. Wide moat | 0/1 | Narrow moat only |
| 6. Revenue stability | 1/1 | Max drawdown ~3% in recessions |
| 7. Management quality | 0.5/1 | Blue Buffalo overpaid, buying back stock instead of deleveraging |
| 8. Analyst coverage >10 | 1/1 | ~20 analysts |
| 9. Market cap >EUR 10B | 1/1 | EUR 20.5B |
| 10. Defensive sector | 1/1 | Consumer staples |

**Quality Score: 6.5/10 --> Tier B (25% MoS required)**

---

## 8. Risk Assessment

### High Impact
1. **Debt Burden**: $13.7B debt, D/E 1.47x. Short-term assets ($5.1B) < liabilities ($7.7B). If FCF drops to $1.5B, debt becomes problematic.
2. **Revenue Decline**: 3 consecutive years declining. FY26 guided flat at best. Volume losses may not recover.

### Medium Impact
3. **GLP-1 Drug Impact**: Ozempic/Wegovy reducing food volumes. Pill forms coming. GIS categories (cereal, snacks) directly exposed.
4. **Private Label**: Store brands gaining share in all GIS categories. Walmart/Costco private label accelerating.
5. **Blue Buffalo Maturation**: Growth engine from $8B acquisition is slowing. Pet food market increasingly competitive.

### Low Impact
6. **Currency**: ~15% international revenue. Moderate FX exposure.
7. **Tariffs**: Minimal direct exposure.

## 9. Investment Decision

### WATCHLIST -- NOT BUY

**Rationale:**
- At $45.68, the stock is approximately fairly valued (midpoint ~$41-48)
- Tier B requires 25% MoS, implying buy price of $31-36
- The 5.3% yield is attractive but was 3% at $67 just 18 months ago -- the market is pricing in real deterioration
- High debt amplifies downside risk if FCF deteriorates further
- The corrected DCF (with net debt) shows base case fair value of $36-51 depending on growth assumptions

**Price Targets:**
- **Strong Buy:** <$34 (>25% MoS on base case)
- **Buy:** $34-38 (achievable MoS if FY26 shows stabilization)
- **Watch:** $38-48 (current zone, fair value)
- **Sell:** >$55 (above fair value)

**What Would Change My Mind:**
1. Two consecutive quarters of positive organic volume growth
2. Debt reduction plan prioritized over buybacks
3. Price drops to $34-38 while fundamentals hold
4. Clear evidence GLP-1 impact is less than feared

---

## 10. Autocritique

**Assumptions:** FCF flat to declining in FY26, terminal growth 2-2.5%, WACC 9%
**Biases detected:** Yield attraction bias (5.3% is seductive), contrarian bias (stock down 32%)
**Evidence possibly ignored:** Q2 FY26 beat estimates; management investing in volume growth may work
**Alternatives considered:** Nestle (wider moat, pricier), Unilever (better balance sheet, similar yield)
