# General Mills (GIS) - Investment Thesis

**Date:** 2026-02-01
**Analyst:** Claude (Fundamental Analyst)
**Status:** BUY CANDIDATE - Tier B (25% MoS required)
**Current Price:** $46.26 (EUR 38.64)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

General Mills is a $25B market cap consumer defensive company trading at 9.6x trailing earnings and 12.4x forward earnings, -31% off its 52-week high. The stock offers a 5.5% dividend yield with 52% payout ratio and has generated consistent FCF of $2.1-2.8B annually over the past 4 years. The company faces near-term headwinds (volume declines, GLP-1 drug impact, yogurt divestiture) but the current valuation appears to price in a permanently impaired business rather than a cyclical trough.

**Verdict:** Attractive entry point but elevated debt (D/E 147%) and declining revenue trend prevent Tier A classification. At Tier B requiring 25% MoS, the stock needs to trade at or below ~$31-33 to meet our strict criteria. At current price of $46.26, the margin of safety is insufficient under our base case DCF (~10-12%). **WATCHLIST at $38-40 range**, or reconsider if FY26 Q2/Q3 results show stabilization.

## 3. Business Overview

General Mills operates across 5 segments:
- **North America Retail** (~$11B, ~56% of sales): Cheerios, Nature Valley, Betty Crocker, Pillsbury, Annie's, Old El Paso
- **Pet** (~$2.7B): Blue Buffalo - #1 natural pet food brand
- **North America Foodservice** (~$2.2B): 55% share in cereal, 51% in biscuits
- **Europe & Australia** (~$2.1B): Haagen-Dazs, Old El Paso
- **Asia & Latin America** (~$1.5B): Haagen-Dazs, Wanchai Ferry

The company divested its North American yogurt business (Yoplait) in FY25, which creates ~8% headwind to reported revenue comparisons.

## 5. Valuation

### Method 1: DCF (10-year, 3 scenarios)

**Assumptions:**
- FCF base: $2.48B (TTM)
- Net debt: $13.05B ($13.73B debt - $0.68B cash)
- Shares: 533.6M

| Scenario | Prob | WACC | Terminal Growth | Growth Path | IV/Share |
|----------|------|------|----------------|-------------|----------|
| Bear | 30% | 9.0% | 1.5% | -5%, -2%, flat 5yrs, +1% 4yrs | ~$30 |
| Base | 50% | 8.5% | 2.0% | -8%, -2%, +1%, then +2% 7yrs | ~$41 |
| Bull | 20% | 8.0% | 2.5% | -5%, +2%, then +3% declining to +2% | ~$60 |

**Probability-Weighted Intrinsic Value: ~$41-42/share**

Note: WACC of 8-9% is appropriate despite near-zero beta because beta is a poor measure of fundamental risk. The high debt load and declining volumes warrant a risk premium.

### Method 2: Comparables

| Peer | P/E | Yield | EV/EBITDA | Assessment |
|------|-----|-------|-----------|------------|
| GIS | 9.6x | 5.5% | 10.7x | Cheapest on P/E |
| CAG (Conagra) | N/A (neg) | 7.8% | ~10x | Worse shape, losing money |
| CPB (Campbell's) | 13.9x | 5.8% | ~11x | Similar quality, pricier |
| SJM (Smucker) | N/A | 4.2% | ~11x | Hostess integration issues |
| KHC (Kraft Heinz) | N/A (neg) | 6.9% | ~10x | Worse balance sheet, impairments |
| MDLZ (Mondelez) | 21.5x | 3.5% | ~16x | Premium snacking, different tier |

**Sector average EV/EBITDA for mid-tier packaged food: 10-11x**
- At 10x EBITDA: EV=$35.4B, Equity=$22.4B -> $42/share
- At 10.5x EBITDA: EV=$37.2B, Equity=$24.1B -> $45/share
- At 11x EBITDA: EV=$38.9B, Equity=$25.9B -> $49/share

**Comparables Fair Value: $42-49/share**

### Method 3: FCF Yield

FCF/share = $2.48B / 533.6M = $4.65

| Target FCF Yield | Implied Price | MoS vs Current |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| 6% | $77.50 | Unrealistic |
| 7% | $66.40 | Too generous |
| 8% | $58.10 | Optimistic |
| 10% (current) | $46.50 | ~Fair value |
| 12% | $38.75 | Bear case |

Current 10% FCF yield is historically high for GIS (normally 5-6%), suggesting either genuine value or a value trap.

### Valuation Summary

| Method | Range | Midpoint |
|--------|-------|----------|
| DCF (prob-weighted) | $30-60 | $41 |
| EV/EBITDA Comps | $42-49 | $45 |
| FCF Yield (7-10%) | $46-66 | $55 |

**Consolidated Fair Value Estimate: $42-48/share (midpoint ~$45)**
**MoS at current price ($46.26): approximately 0% to -10%** (essentially fair to slightly overvalued vs our base case)
**Price for 25% MoS (Tier B): $31-36**

## 6. Moat Assessment

### Moat Rating: NARROW (not Wide)

**Positive moat factors:**
1. **Brand portfolio** (moderate): Cheerios, Haagen-Dazs, Nature Valley, Blue Buffalo are category leaders. But packaged food brands are weakening vs private label.
2. **Distribution/shelf space** (moderate): Decades of retailer relationships, 55% share in foodservice cereal. Hard to replicate.
3. **Scale** (moderate): $19B revenue enables marketing spend and R&D that smaller players cannot match.
4. **Blue Buffalo** (strong in niche): #1 natural pet food with genuine switching costs (pet owners reluctant to change).

**Moat weaknesses:**
1. **No pricing power**: Post-COVID pricing backlash. Consumers trading down to private label across cereals, snacks, baking.
2. **Low switching costs**: Most GIS products are easily substitutable. Cheerios competes with store-brand O's.
3. **Secular headwinds**: GLP-1 drugs reducing food consumption. Healthier eating trends away from processed food.
4. **Private label growth**: Retailer own-brands gaining share in every GIS category.

**Moat Score: 5/10** - Narrow moat, sufficient for survival but not for pricing power or sustained above-average returns.

## 7. Quality Score (Tier Assessment)

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| 1. ROE >15% (5yr) | YES | 27% but leverage-inflated |
| 2. FCF positive 5yr | YES | $2.1-2.8B consistently |
| 3. D/E <1.0 | NO | D/E = 1.47, significantly above threshold |
| 4. Dividend 10+ yr uncut | YES | 125+ years of dividends |
| 5. Wide moat | NO | Narrow moat only |
| 6. Revenue stability | YES | Max drawdown ~3% in recessions |
| 7. Management quality | PARTIAL | Good capital allocation (buybacks), but overleveraged from Blue Buffalo acquisition |
| 8. Analyst coverage >10 | YES | ~20 analysts |
| 9. Market cap >10B EUR | YES | ~$25B |
| 10. Defensive sector | YES | Consumer staples |

**Quality Score: 6.5/10 -> Tier B (25% MoS required)**

The high debt load and narrow (not wide) moat prevent Tier A classification. ROE is flattering due to leverage.

---

## 8. Risk Assessment

### High Impact Risks
1. **GLP-1 Drug Impact (HIGH)**: Ozempic/Wegovy/Mounjaro reducing food consumption. Pill forms coming 2026. Could reduce food volumes 3-5% industry-wide. GIS categories (cereal, snacks, baking) are directly exposed.
2. **Debt Burden (HIGH)**: $13.7B debt, D/E 147%, interest expense $524M/yr and rising. Current ratio 0.66. If FCF declines further, debt servicing becomes problematic. No near-term refinancing crisis but limited flexibility.
3. **Revenue Decline (MEDIUM-HIGH)**: 3 consecutive years of declining revenue (post-pricing peak). FY26 guided flat to down. Volume losses may not recover.

### Medium Impact Risks
4. **Private Label Competition**: Store brands gaining share in cereals, baking mixes, canned goods. Walmart/Costco private label strategy accelerating.
5. **Input Cost Inflation**: Grain, sugar, packaging costs volatile. Margins could compress if unable to pass through.
6. **Blue Buffalo Growth Slowing**: The growth engine from the $8B acquisition is maturing. Pet food market increasingly competitive (Freshpet, Farmer's Dog).

### Low Impact Risks
7. **Currency**: ~15% international revenue. Moderate FX exposure.
8. **Tariffs**: Minimal direct exposure but could affect input costs.

### Risk-Adjusted Assessment
The combination of high debt + declining volumes + GLP-1 headwind creates a **higher risk profile than typical consumer staples**. This is not a "sleep well at night" stock despite the defensive sector classification. The -0.07 beta masks fundamental business risk.

---

## 9. Catalysts

**Positive:**
- FY26 results better than guided (volume stabilization)
- Successful price/pack architecture reducing private label switching
- Blue Buffalo re-acceleration
- Debt paydown from FCF (currently repurchasing shares instead - questionable allocation)
- Activist involvement (possible given valuation)

**Negative:**
- GLP-1 pill form adoption faster than expected
- Further volume declines
- Credit rating downgrade
- Dividend cut (unlikely at 52% payout but not impossible if FCF drops to $1.5B)

---

## 10. Investment Decision

### WATCHLIST - NOT YET BUY

**Rationale:**
- GIS is a decent business at a fair price, not a great business at a great price.
- At $46.26, the stock is approximately fairly valued (our midpoint ~$45) with essentially 0% margin of safety.
- Tier B classification requires 25% MoS, implying a buy price of ~$31-36.
- The declining revenue trend, GLP-1 risk, and high leverage make this more of a value trap risk than a classic value opportunity.
- The 5.5% yield is attractive but the yield was 3% eighteen months ago at $67 - the market is telling us something.

**Price Targets:**
- **Strong Buy:** <$34 (>25% MoS on base case, ~7.0x trailing PE)
- **Buy:** $34-38 (15-25% MoS, only if FY26 results show stabilization)
- **Watch:** $38-48 (current zone, fair value)
- **Sell:** >$55 (above fair value)

**Portfolio Fit:**
- Would add consumer defensive exposure (currently only IMB.L in tobacco)
- Low/negative beta would reduce portfolio volatility
- US exposure currently limited (PFE, ALL, VICI only)
- Sizing: 4-5% position if triggered ($500-600)

### What Would Change My Mind
1. Two consecutive quarters of positive organic volume growth
2. Debt reduction plan prioritized over buybacks
3. Price drops to $34-38 range while fundamentals hold
4. Clear evidence GLP-1 impact is less than feared in packaged food

---

## 11. Autocritique

**Assumptions made:**
- FCF will decline 5-8% in FY26 (conservative vs guidance of 10-15% EPS decline)
- Terminal growth of 2% is reasonable for a mature food company
- WACC of 8.5% base case (higher than beta-implied due to leverage risk)

**Biases detected:**
- Yield attraction bias: 5.5% yield is seductive but could be a trap
- Contrarian bias: stock is down 31%, tempting to call it "cheap" when it may be cheap for good reason

**Evidence I might be ignoring:**
- Management is buying back stock ($1.2B in FY25) instead of paying down debt - this could be smart (stock is cheap) or reckless (leverage is high)
- The yogurt divestiture removes a weak business but also removes revenue scale
- Blue Buffalo was acquired for $8B in 2018 and has not delivered the growth to justify that price

**Alternatives considered:**
- Nestle (NESN): Higher quality, wider moat, but pricier
- Mondelez (MDLZ): Better growth profile in snacking, premium valuation
- Unilever (UL): More diversified, similar yield, better balance sheet
