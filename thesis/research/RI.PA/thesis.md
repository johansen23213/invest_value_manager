# Pernod Ricard SA (RI.PA) - Investment Thesis

**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Analyst:** Fundamental Analyst Agent
**Status:** CONDITIONAL BUY - Wait for H1 FY26 earnings (19-Feb-2026)

---

## Executive Summary

Pernod Ricard, the world's #2 spirits company, trades at EUR 74.58 -- a 10-year valuation low (11.6x trailing P/E, 6.3% yield) after a 32% decline from 52-week highs. The selloff is driven by three concurrent headwinds: China demand collapse (Martell -25%), US distributor destocking (Q1 FY26 US -16%), and a strong EUR/weak USD reducing reported results. The company has a wide moat (iconic brands, global distribution, pricing power) and is executing a EUR 1B efficiency program. However, FCF barely covers the dividend (0.99x), leverage is elevated at 3.3x Net Debt/EBITDA, and Q1 FY26 was weak (-7.6% organic).

**Verdict:** On normalized mid-cycle earnings, fair value is EUR 95-110 per share (14-16x P/E), implying 27-47% upside. However, the near-term picture is poor and the H1 FY26 results on Feb 19 are critical. The dividend is at risk if FCF doesn't improve. This is a Tier B cyclical opportunity (25% MoS required). At EUR 74.58 with a base fair value of EUR 95-100, MoS is 21-25% -- borderline. Wait for earnings to confirm the trough.

## Business Model

Pernod Ricard manufactures, markets, and distributes premium spirits and wines globally. It is the world's second-largest spirits company by volume behind Diageo, with 240+ brands across 160 countries.

**Revenue by region (FY25 approx):** Americas ~30%, Asia/RoW ~35%, Europe ~35%.

**Key brands:** Absolut (vodka), Jameson (Irish whiskey), Chivas Regal & The Glenlivet (Scotch), Martell (Cognac), Beefeater (gin), Malibu (rum), Ricard/Pastis (anise), Havana Club (rum). 17 of top 100 global spirits brands.

**Key economics:**
- High gross margins (~60%) from branded spirits
- Premiumization trend: consumers trading up to higher-priced bottles
- Aging requirements for Scotch/Cognac = natural moat but ties up capital
- Global distribution network extremely difficult to replicate
- FY25: wine portfolio disposed to sharpen spirits focus

---

## Why Is It Down 32%?

Three concurrent cyclical headwinds, NOT structural impairment:

### 1. China Collapse (-25% Martell, -21% China revenue FY25)
- Anti-corruption campaigns reduced gifting/banquet spending
- China MOFCOM anti-dumping investigation on EU cognac created uncertainty
- Resolution in July 2025: minimum price undertaking (not full tariffs) -- costs ~EUR 80M/yr
- Martell is ~90% of Pernod's China decline -- extreme brand concentration risk in one market
- China showing no recovery in Q1 FY26

### 2. US Destocking (Q1 FY26 US -16%)
- Post-COVID inventory buildup being unwound
- Tariff uncertainty caused distributors to pre-buy then destock
- Sell-out (actual consumer demand) performing better than sell-in (distributor orders)
- Expected to normalize by H2 FY26

### 3. FX Headwinds
- Strong EUR vs USD/INR/TRY reduced reported results
- EUR 177M unfavorable FX in H1 FY25, EUR 143M in Q1 FY26
- Purely translational -- no impact on local business fundamentals

---

## Moat Assessment: WIDE (7/10 confidence)

### 1. Brand Power (PRIMARY MOAT)
- 17 of top 100 spirits brands globally
- Most diversified spirits portfolio in the world (vodka, whiskey, cognac, gin, rum, anise)
- Consumer loyalty in spirits is exceptionally sticky
- Premiumization allows revenue growth without volume growth

### 2. Scale & Distribution
- #2 globally, present in 160 countries
- Distribution network took decades to build; impossible to replicate organically
- Local brands (Seagram's India, Ricard France) add geographic moats

### 3. Aging Barrier
- Scotch, cognac require years of aging -- massive working capital barrier to entry
- Chivas 18yr, Martell XO require decade+ of inventory investment

### 4. Pricing Power
- Spirits are relatively price-inelastic
- FY25: despite volume decline, PRO margin expanded +64bps through pricing/mix
- Premium portfolio naturally benefits from trade-up

### Moat vs Diageo
- Diageo has 13 billion-dollar brands vs Pernod's 17-of-top-100 (Diageo brands are individually larger)
- Diageo is 1.5x larger by revenue and 2x by market cap
- Pernod's portfolio is MORE diversified across categories (especially cognac via Martell)
- Pernod has greater China/India exposure -- higher growth potential but higher volatility
- **Verdict:** Both wide moat. Diageo slightly wider due to scale and brand scale. Pernod more volatile due to geographic mix.

## Financial Analysis

### Revenue & Profitability Trend

| Year | Revenue (EUR B) | PRO (EUR B) | PRO Margin | EPS (EUR) |
|------|----------------|------------|------------|-----------|
| FY22 | 10.70 | 3.02 | 28.2% | ~7.50 |
| FY23 | 12.14 | 3.32 | 27.4% | ~8.20 |
| FY24 | 11.60 | 3.11 | 26.8% | ~7.00 |
| FY25 | 10.96 | 2.94 | 26.8% | ~6.46 |
| Q1 FY26 | 2.38 (-7.6% org) | -- | -- | -- |

Revenue peaked in FY23 and has declined ~10% since. Op margin is resilient (+64bps in FY25) showing pricing power and cost discipline. EPS down ~21% from peak.

### Free Cash Flow

| Year | FCF (EUR B) | FCF/Share | Dividend | FCF Coverage |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| FY22 | 1.79 | 7.10 | 4.12 | 1.72x |
| FY23 | 1.33 | 5.28 | 4.70 | 1.12x |
| FY24 | 0.95 | 3.79 | 4.70 | 0.81x |
| FY25 | 1.17 | 4.65 | 4.70 | 0.99x |

FCF troughed in FY24 and recovered +18% in FY25. However, FCF coverage of the dividend is BARELY 1.0x. The EUR 4.70 dividend was held flat (first time in years -- signal of stress). If FCF doesn't improve in FY26, a dividend cut is possible.

### Balance Sheet

| Metric | FY25 | Assessment |
|--------|------|------------|
| Net Debt | EUR 10.76B | High |
| Net Debt/EBITDA | 3.3x | Peak was 3.5x at H1 |
| Total Debt | EUR 12.6B | |
| Cash | EUR 1.8B | |
| Debt/Equity | 77.6% | Manageable |

Deleveraging catalysts: Wine disposal completed (April 2025), Imperial Blue India disposal (July 2025), capex normalizing down from peak, EUR 1B efficiency program FY26-29.

## Valuation

### Method 1: P/E Multiple on Normalized Earnings

Mid-cycle normalized EPS: ~EUR 6.80 (based on EUR 11.5B revenue, 27% PRO margin, 55% flow-through)

| Multiple | Fair Value | MoS vs EUR 74.58 |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| 14x (bear -- cyclical discount) | EUR 95 | 22% |
| 16x (base -- discount to historical) | EUR 109 | 32% |
| 18x (bull -- moat re-rating) | EUR 122 | 39% |
| 20x (historical average) | EUR 136 | 45% |

**Analyst consensus target: ~EUR 110-120 (varies by source)**

### Method 2: EV/EBITDA

| Multiple | EV | Equity Value | FV/Share | MoS |
|----------|-----|-------------|----------|-----|
| 9x (current) | 29.3B | 18.5B | EUR 73.5 | -1% |
| 10x | 32.5B | 21.8B | EUR 86 | 14% |
| 11x | 35.8B | 25.0B | EUR 99 | 25% |
| 12x (historical avg) | 39.0B | 28.3B | EUR 112 | 34% |

At 9x EBITDA, the stock is fairly valued. The question is whether it deserves >9x.

### Method 3: Yield-Based

- Current yield: 6.3%
- 10-year average yield: ~2.5-3.0%
- If yield normalizes to 4.0% (still well above historical): EUR 4.70 / 4.0% = EUR 117.50 (37% upside)
- If yield stays at 5.0% (new normal with higher leverage): EUR 4.70 / 5.0% = EUR 94 (21% upside)
- If dividend is cut 20% to EUR 3.76: EUR 3.76 / 5.0% = EUR 75 (at current price)

### Method 4: DCF (tool output)

The dcf_calculator.py produced very conservative results (Bear EUR 19, Base EUR 35, Bull EUR 58) because:
- Default growth rates too low for a branded consumer business at trough earnings
- Net debt of EUR 10.76B massively compresses equity value
- The tool's default parameters are not calibrated for capital-intensive spirits businesses with aging inventory

**I override the tool's DCF output as unreliable for this type of business.** P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples are more appropriate for branded consumer companies.

### Valuation Summary

| Method | Fair Value | MoS |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| P/E 14x normalized (bear) | EUR 95 | 22% |
| P/E 16x normalized (base) | EUR 109 | 32% |
| EV/EBITDA 11x | EUR 99 | 25% |
| Yield normalization (4%) | EUR 118 | 37% |
| Yield normalization (5%) | EUR 94 | 21% |

**Central estimate: EUR 95-110 (MoS 22-32%)**

## RI.PA vs DGE.L -- Head-to-Head

| Metric | RI.PA | DGE.L | Winner |
|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| Trailing P/E | 11.6x | 22.0x | RI.PA (but DGE distorted by exceptionals) |
| Forward P/E | ~12.0x | ~13.8x | RI.PA |
| Dividend Yield | 6.3% | 4.8% | RI.PA |
| FCF Coverage of Div | 0.99x | ~1.5x | DGE.L (much safer) |
| Net Debt/EBITDA | 3.3x | 3.4x | Comparable |
| Op Margin | 26.8% | 27.3% | Comparable |
| ROE | 10.1% | 20.1% | DGE.L (much higher) |
| Revenue Scale | EUR 11B | USD 20B | DGE.L (1.5x larger) |
| Moat Width | Wide | Wide | DGE.L (slightly wider) |
| China Exposure | HIGH (Martell) | MODERATE | DGE.L (lower risk) |
| MoS (my estimate) | 22-32% | 25-31% | Comparable |
| Earnings catalyst | Feb 19 | Feb 25 | Both imminent |

**Verdict:** RI.PA is optically cheaper but DGE.L is the BETTER BUY because:
1. Diageo's FCF coverage of dividend is 1.5x vs Pernod's 0.99x -- Diageo dividend is much safer
2. Diageo ROE (20%) far exceeds Pernod (10%) -- better capital efficiency
3. Diageo has less China concentration risk
4. Both have similar MoS, but Diageo has lower risk profile
5. DGE.L qualifies as Tier A (7.5/10 quality score, 15% MoS threshold). RI.PA is Tier B (higher MoS needed)

RI.PA has higher upside IF China recovers strongly (Martell recovery = massive earnings leverage). It is the higher-beta play on spirits recovery.

---

## Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISKS
1. **Dividend sustainability** -- FCF coverage 0.99x. If FY26 FCF doesn't improve, dividend cut is likely. A cut would send shares significantly lower (yield trap).
2. **China structural risk** -- Martell is ~90% of China decline. If Chinese consumer spending doesn't recover, this is a permanent impairment to a key growth market.
3. **US tariffs** -- Potential additional tariffs on EU spirits could add to headwinds beyond current levels.
4. **Leverage at 3.3x** -- Limited financial flexibility. Cannot buy back shares, limited M&A capacity.

### MEDIUM RISKS
5. **FX headwinds continuing** -- Strong EUR vs reporting currencies reduces translated profits
6. **Destocking duration** -- US destocking may extend beyond H1 FY26 if tariff uncertainty persists
7. **India excise policy changes** -- Maharashtra policy impacted Q1 FY26; could spread to other states
8. **Efficiency program execution** -- EUR 1B savings target ambitious, execution risk

### LOW RISKS
9. **Gen Z drinking less** -- Structural but very slow-moving, partially offset by premiumization and emerging market growth
10. **Competitor pressure** -- Diageo, Brown-Forman, Campari all well-positioned but market is not winner-take-all

---

## Quality Score (Tier Assessment)

| # | Criterion | Score | Notes |
|---|-----------|-------|-------|
| 1 | ROE >15% (5yr) | 0/1 | **FAIL** -- ROE only 10.1% currently, inconsistent >15% |
| 2 | FCF positive 5yr | 1/1 | Yes, consistently positive |
| 3 | Debt/Equity <1.0 | 1/1 | 77.6% D/E (passes, but Net Debt/EBITDA 3.3x is high) |
| 4 | 10+ yr dividend streak | 1/1 | Yes, though held flat FY25 |
| 5 | Wide moat | 1/1 | Wide moat confirmed |
| 6 | Revenue stability | 0.5/1 | Revenue down 10% from peak -- moderate cyclicality for "staples" |
| 7 | Management quality | 0.5/1 | Efficiency program good, but slow to address leverage |
| 8 | Analyst coverage >10 | 1/1 | 20 analysts |
| 9 | Market cap >EUR 10B | 1/1 | EUR 18.8B |
| 10 | Defensive sector | 0.5/1 | Spirits are quasi-staples but MORE cyclical than food/utilities |

**Quality Score: 6.5/10 --> Tier B (25% MoS required)**

The ROE failure and revenue cyclicality prevent Tier A classification. This is a cyclical quality stock, not a defensive compounder.

---

## Autocritica (Pre-Recommendation)

- **Assumptions:** I assume mid-cycle normalized EPS of EUR 6.80. If China doesn't recover and US growth stalls, trough earnings could persist and EUR 6.80 is too generous.
- **Biases detected:** Anchoring to historical P/E multiples of 20-22x. The market may be correctly repricing spirits companies to lower multiples permanently due to Gen Z trends and leverage.
- **Evidence ignored:** The FY26 efficiency program could accelerate FCF recovery faster than I model, making the bull case stronger.
- **Validation:** P/E and EV/EBITDA methods converge on EUR 95-110 range. Analyst consensus aligns. Cross-validated against DGE.L comparable.
- **Alternatives considered:** DGE.L is the main alternative -- better risk-adjusted but similar upside. Brown-Forman at 28x fwd is too expensive. Remy Cointreau at 25x has higher China risk.

## Decision

### CONDITIONAL BUY -- Wait for H1 FY26 Earnings (Feb 19, 2026)

The stock is borderline at current prices. MoS is 22-32% depending on method, straddling the 25% Tier B threshold.

**Why wait:**
1. H1 FY26 results in 17 days will clarify: FCF trajectory, dividend decision, China/US recovery signs
2. If FCF improves and dividend is maintained, MoS expands and risk decreases
3. If FCF deteriorates and dividend is cut, the stock could fall to EUR 60-65 (and become a better entry)

**Entry triggers post-earnings:**
- **BUY at EUR 70-75** if: FCF coverage improves to >1.1x, dividend maintained, organic growth shows H2 inflection
- **BUY at EUR 60-65** if: dividend cut but operational fundamentals stabilizing (contrarian entry)
- **PASS** if: leverage increases to >3.5x AND no clear path to recovery

**Position size:** EUR 400-450 (3.5-4% of portfolio). Lower than max due to leverage and dividend risk.

**vs DGE.L:** If forced to choose ONE spirits name, DGE.L is preferred (safer dividend, higher ROE, wider moat). Could own both for diversification within spirits (different geographic/brand exposure).

### Price Monitors
- Alert if RI.PA drops below EUR 70 (closer to 52w low, better entry)
- Alert if RI.PA rises above EUR 85 pre-earnings (reduced MoS, reconsider)
- H1 FY26 earnings: **February 19, 2026** -- CRITICAL catalyst

## Comparables

| Company | Fwd P/E | Yield | Net Debt/EBITDA | Moat | MoS |
|---------|---------|-------|-----------------|------|-----|
| Pernod Ricard (RI.PA) | ~12x | 6.3% | 3.3x | Wide | 22-32% |
| Diageo (DGE.L) | ~13.8x | 4.8% | 3.4x | Wide | 25-31% |
| Remy Cointreau | ~25x | 3.0% | ~2.5x | Narrow | Negative |
| Brown-Forman | ~28x | 2.0% | ~1.5x | Wide | Negative |
| Campari | ~20x | 2.5% | ~2.0x | Narrow | Negative |

Pernod and Diageo are the only wide-moat spirits names trading at historically depressed valuations. Both are attractive on a 2-3 year view IF earnings recover.
