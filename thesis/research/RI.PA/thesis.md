# RI.PA - Pernod Ricard

> Analysis Date: 2026-02-04 (Updated from 2026-02-02)
> Framework: v3.0 Quality First
> Analyst: fundamental-analyst (Claude)
> Previous Status: CONDITIONAL BUY - Wait for H1 FY26 earnings (19-Feb-2026)

## TL;DR

Pernod Ricard is the #2 global spirits company with an iconic brand portfolio (Absolut, Jameson, Chivas, Martell), trading at P/E 12.4x and -26% from 52-week highs (EUR 80 current vs EUR 107 high). **Quality Score 51/100 (Tier C)** indicates mediocre quality driven by weak ROIC spread (+3.9pp vs required >5pp), high leverage (3.3x), and declining growth (-6.6% EPS CAGR 3yr). Despite premium brands and strong gross margins (59.5%), the company faces significant headwinds from China tariffs (-21% China sales), US destocking, and a "transition year" in FY2026. **Valuation analysis shows stock is fairly valued to modestly overvalued** - weighted fair value EUR 60-75 vs current EUR 80. The 6.2% dividend yield is attractive but not sufficient compensation for execution risks. **VERDICT: WATCHLIST at EUR 55-60** - wait for deeper correction or evidence of China recovery.

## Business Understanding

### What Problem Does Pernod Ricard Solve?

Pernod Ricard provides premium alcoholic beverages (spirits, wine, champagne) for:
1. **Social occasions** - celebrations, dining, entertainment
2. **Status signaling** - premium/luxury brands communicate affluence
3. **Taste preferences** - specific spirit categories (whisky, cognac, vodka)

This is a **"nice-to-have"** with strong emotional/social components, making demand somewhat discretionary but resilient due to brand loyalty.

### Revenue Model

| Revenue Source | % of Total | Characteristics |
|----------------|------------|-----------------|
| Spirits (core) | ~85% | Repeat purchase, brand loyalty |
| Wine & Champagne | ~10% | Seasonal, higher margin |
| Travel Retail | ~5% | High margin, volatile |

**Geographic Mix (FY2025):**
- Americas: 33% (US is largest single market)
- Asia/RoW: 32% (China, India, Travel Retail)
- Europe: 35%

### Brand Portfolio Strength

| Brand | Category | Position | Notes |
|-------|----------|----------|-------|
| **Absolut** | Vodka | #3 global | Iconic, but category declining |
| **Jameson** | Irish Whiskey | #1 global | Growth driver |
| **Chivas Regal** | Scotch | Top 5 global | Premium positioning |
| **Martell** | Cognac | #2 global | China exposure (tariff hit) |
| **The Glenlivet** | Single Malt | Top 3 global | Premium growth |
| **Ballantine's** | Scotch | #2 global | Value segment |
| **Malibu** | Rum/Liqueur | #1 global | Younger demographic |
| **Beefeater** | Gin | Top 5 global | UK/EU focused |

### Margin Structure

| Metric | FY2025 | FY2024 | FY2023 | Trend |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Revenue | EUR 10.96B | EUR 11.60B | EUR 12.14B | Declining |
| Gross Margin | 59.5% | 60.1% | 59.7% | Stable |
| Operating Margin | 26.8% | 26.8% | 27.3% | Stable |
| Net Margin | 14.8% | 12.7% | 18.6% | Volatile |
| FCF Margin | 10.2% | 8.2% | 11.0% | Declining |

**vs Diageo (peer):**
- Diageo Gross Margin: 60.4% (similar)
- Diageo Operating Margin: 27.3% (similar)
- Diageo ROE: 20.1% vs Pernod 10.1% (Diageo significantly better)

### Balance Sheet

| Metric | FY2025 | Assessment |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Total Debt | EUR 12.6B | |
| Cash | EUR 1.8B | |
| Net Debt | EUR 10.8B | High |
| Net Debt/EBITDA | 3.3x | Elevated |
| Debt/Equity | 77.6% | Manageable |
| Goodwill + Intangibles | EUR 24.5B | 151% of equity - HIGH |
| Interest Coverage | 4.8x | Adequate |

## Why Is It Cheap? (CRITICAL)

### Market Narrative

1. **China tariffs & destocking (-21% China sales FY2025)**
   - Anti-dumping investigation on EU cognac
   - Excess distributor inventory being worked through
   - Martell brand heavily exposed

2. **US market weakness (Q1 FY26 US -16%)**
   - Destocking cycle in US distribution
   - Consumer trade-down to value brands
   - Sell-out (actual consumer demand) performing better than sell-in

3. **"Transition year" guidance for FY2026**
   - Management guided for continued sales decline in H1
   - Recovery skewed to H2 FY2026

4. **Earnings declining**
   - Net income down from EUR 2.26B (FY2023) to EUR 1.63B (FY2025)
   - EPS down -27% from peak

### My Counter-Thesis (and why I'm skeptical)

| Narrative | My View | Confidence |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| China tariffs permanent | PARTIAL - Tariffs may ease late 2026 but structural China weakness remains | 60% |
| US destocking temporary | LIKELY TRUE - Inventory normalization should complete by H2 2026 | 70% |
| Brands losing relevance | FALSE - #2 position intact, premiumization trend supports | 80% |
| Dividend at risk | UNCERTAIN - 73% payout, FCF barely covers dividend (0.99x) | 50% |
| Value trap | FALSE - ROIC > WACC, FCF positive, industry stable | 75% |

**KEY INSIGHT:** The stock has declined -42% from 5-year highs (EUR 137 to EUR 80). The market has priced in significant pain. BUT the current price still implies ~9.5x EV/EBITDA which is not cheap for a business with 1% revenue growth and declining earnings. The dividend yield of 6.2% is attractive but reflects risk, not opportunity.

### Value Trap Checklist: 2/10 (LOW RISK)

| Factor | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Industry declining | NO | Spirits 3-4% CAGR |
| Technology disruption | NO | RTDs are opportunity |
| Management destroying value | PARTIAL | China/US execution issues |
| Balance deteriorating | NO | Net debt stable |
| Insider selling | NO | Family maintains 14% |
| Dividend cut likely | NO | 73% payout, but FCF coverage 0.99x is tight |
| Market share loss | PARTIAL | China share lost, #2 global intact |
| ROIC < WACC | NO | 8.3% vs 4-5% WACC |
| FCF negative | NO | 4/5 years positive |
| Goodwill >50% equity | YES | EUR 24.5B / EUR 16.2B = 151% |

**Conclusion:** Not a value trap, but not high quality either. The goodwill concern is mitigated by brand strength.

## Valuation (Multi-Method)

### Method 1: DCF (60% weight)

**Base Case Assumptions:**
- Normalized FCF: EUR 1.13B (3yr average)
- Growth Years 1-5: +2%, +3%, +3%, +3%, +3%
- WACC: 8%
- Terminal Growth: 2.5%
- Net Debt: EUR 10.76B

| Scenario | FV/Share | MoS at EUR 80 |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Bear** (0% growth) | EUR 30 | -167% |
| **Base** (3% growth) | EUR 42 | -90% |
| **Bull** (5% growth) | EUR 57 | -40% |

### Method 2: EV/EBITDA Comparable (40% weight)

| Multiple | Fair Value/Share | MoS at EUR 80 |
|----------|------------------|---------------|
| 8x (distressed) | EUR 61 | -31% |
| 9x (conservative) | EUR 73 | -10% |
| 10x (fair) | EUR 86 | +7% |

**Current Trading:** 9.5x EV/EBITDA

### Method 3: P/E Normalized (Cross-Check)

Mid-cycle normalized EPS: EUR 6.80 (based on EUR 11.5B revenue, 27% PRO margin)

| Multiple | Fair Value | MoS at EUR 80 |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| 14x (bear) | EUR 95 | +16% |
| 16x (base) | EUR 109 | +27% |
| 18x (bull) | EUR 122 | +34% |

**Note:** Analyst consensus target EUR 110-129 uses normalized P/E multiples.

### Weighted Fair Value

The methods diverge significantly:
- DCF (conservative, stress-tests FCF): EUR 42-57
- EV/EBITDA (market-based): EUR 61-86
- Normalized P/E (assumes recovery): EUR 95-122

**Interpretation:** DCF captures downside risk; P/E captures upside if recovery materializes.

| Method | Fair Value | Weight | Weighted |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| DCF Base | EUR 42 | 40% | EUR 16.80 |
| EV/EBITDA 9x | EUR 73 | 40% | EUR 29.20 |
| Normalized P/E 14x | EUR 95 | 20% | EUR 19.00 |
| **Weighted Average** | | **100%** | **EUR 65** |

### Fair Value Range

| Scenario | Fair Value | MoS at EUR 80 |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Conservative (DCF)** | EUR 42 | -90% (OVERVALUED) |
| **Weighted** | EUR 65 | -23% (OVERVALUED) |
| **Normalized (P/E)** | EUR 95 | +16% (FAIRLY VALUED) |

---

## Margin of Safety Analysis

**Current Price:** EUR 80.02
**Weighted Fair Value:** EUR 65
**MoS Required (Tier C):** 30-40%

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| MoS vs Weighted FV | -23% | **OVERVALUED** |
| MoS vs Conservative FV | -90% | **SIGNIFICANTLY OVERVALUED** |
| MoS vs Normalized FV | +16% | Fairly valued if recovery occurs |
| **Required MoS (Tier C)** | 30-40% | **NOT MET** |

### Entry Price Calculation

To achieve 30% MoS vs Weighted FV (EUR 65):
- Entry Price = EUR 65 * 0.70 = **EUR 45**

To achieve 30% MoS vs Normalized FV (EUR 95):
- Entry Price = EUR 95 * 0.70 = **EUR 67**

**Practical Entry Target: EUR 55-60** (compromise between conservative and normalized)

---

## Scenarios

| Scenario | Probability | Fair Value | Assumptions |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| **Bear** | 25% | EUR 30-42 | China tariffs permanent, US share loss, dividend cut |
| **Base** | 50% | EUR 65-75 | FY2026 transition, H2 recovery begins, 3% normalized growth |
| **Bull** | 25% | EUR 95-110 | China tariffs lifted late 2026, India accelerates, 4% growth |

### Expected Value

EV = (EUR 36 * 0.25) + (EUR 70 * 0.50) + (EUR 102 * 0.25)
EV = EUR 9 + EUR 35 + EUR 25.5 = **EUR 69.50**

MoS at EUR 80 vs EV of EUR 70: **-14% (OVERVALUED)**

---

## Kill Conditions (MANDATORY)

**SELL IMMEDIATELY IF:**

1. **Dividend cut or suspension** - Signals cash flow stress beyond market expectations
2. **Net Debt/EBITDA > 4.5x** - Balance sheet deterioration
3. **ROIC falls below 5%** - Moat erosion
4. **China sales decline >30% two consecutive years** - Structural brand damage
5. **Market share drops to #4 or below globally** - Competitive position lost

---

## Macro Fit

From world/current_view.md (2026-02-02):

| Factor | Impact on Pernod | Assessment |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| EUR rates stable | Neutral | No yield re-rating catalyst |
| China weakness | NEGATIVE | 32% Asia exposure |
| Tariff risk | NEGATIVE | Cognac tariffs |
| Consumer staples ignored | Neutral | No catalyst |

**Conclusion:** Macro is not supportive. China/tariff exposure is a headwind.

---

## Recommendation

### VERDICT: WATCHLIST at EUR 55-60

**NOT BUY because:**
1. Quality Score 51/100 (Tier C) requires 30-40% MoS
2. Current price EUR 80 vs Fair Value EUR 65-70 = **overvalued**
3. No clear near-term catalyst (FY2026 is "transition year")
4. China/tariff risk not fully resolved
5. FCF coverage of dividend is tight (0.99x)

**WATCHLIST because:**
1. Not a value trap (ROIC > WACC, FCF positive, brands strong)
2. #2 global position in attractive industry
3. 6.2% dividend yield attractive if price drops
4. Ricard family alignment (14% stake)
5. Long-term premiumization trend intact

### Entry Conditions

**Add to BUY list if:**
- Price falls to EUR 55-60 (25-30% below current)
- China tariff resolution announced
- FY2026 H2 shows clear recovery (revenue +5% H2 vs H1)
- Quality Score improves to 55+ (Tier B)

### Standing Order

| Trigger | Action | Sizing |
|---------|--------|--------|
| EUR 60 | ALERT - Review thesis | - |
| EUR 55 | BUY initial position | 2% |
| EUR 50 | ADD | +1% (3% total) |
| EUR 45 | ADD (if thesis intact) | +1% (4% total) |

### Upcoming Catalyst

**H1 FY26 Earnings: February 19, 2026** - CRITICAL
- Watch for: FCF trajectory, dividend decision, China/US recovery signs
- If FCF improves and dividend maintained, thesis strengthens
- If dividend cut, wait for further decline before entry

## RI.PA vs DGE.L Comparison

| Metric | RI.PA | DGE.L | Winner |
|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| P/E | 12.4x | 23.0x | RI.PA cheaper |
| Yield | 6.2% | 4.7% | RI.PA higher |
| FCF Coverage of Div | 0.99x | ~1.5x | **DGE.L (safer)** |
| Net Debt/EBITDA | 3.3x | 3.4x | Similar |
| ROE | 10.1% | 20.1% | **DGE.L (2x better)** |
| Quality Score | 51 (Tier C) | ~65 (Tier B) | **DGE.L** |

**Verdict:** DGE.L is preferred on risk-adjusted basis (safer dividend, higher ROE). RI.PA is higher-beta play on spirits recovery - more upside if China recovers, more downside if not.

## META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres

1. **WACC estimation uncertainty:** Beta of 0.37 seems too low for a company with 32% China exposure during trade tensions. I used 8% WACC but this is judgmental.

2. **Valuation method divergence:** DCF (EUR 42) vs Normalized P/E (EUR 95) is a 126% spread. This reflects genuine uncertainty about whether current earnings are trough or new normal.

3. **Dividend sustainability:** FCF coverage 0.99x is razor-thin. A dividend cut would trigger selling and lower the stock further - but would also reduce stress and potentially be healthy.

4. **FY2026 trajectory unclear:** Management says "transition year" but the timing and magnitude of recovery is uncertain.

### Sugerencias de Mejora

1. **Tool Enhancement:** quality_scorer.py should allow manual WACC input for more accurate ROIC spread calculation.

2. **Sector View:** Consider creating `world/sectors/spirits-beverages.md` to track spirits industry trends separately from broad consumer staples.

3. **DCF Tool:** The tool's default parameters produce very conservative results for capital-intensive consumer businesses. May need sector-specific templates.

### Anomalias Detectadas

1. **Yield display error in yfinance:** Shows 617% yield (should be 6.17%). price_checker.py correctly displays 6.2%.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator

1. Should we create a separate sector view for spirits/alcoholic beverages?

2. Given the valuation uncertainty (DCF vs P/E spread), should entry target be EUR 55-60 (conservative) or EUR 65-70 (normalized)?

3. Should Pernod be added to consumer-staples.md sector view under "Analizadas - Watchlist"?
