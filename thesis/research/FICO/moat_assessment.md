# Moat Assessment: FICO (Fair Isaac Corporation)

## Fecha: 2026-02-11

## Clasificacion: WIDE (ERODING) -- Under First Serious Threat in 30 Years

**Summary verdict:** FICO possesses a Wide moat built on 3 reinforcing sources (intangible assets/regulatory entrenchment, switching costs, and efficient scale). However, for the first time in 30+ years, the moat is under active siege. The VantageScore FHFA approval (Jul 2025) is real and material, but adoption barriers remain formidable. The moat is transitioning from "unassailable" to "very strong but no longer invincible." I estimate the moat remains Wide for the next 10-15 years but reclassification to Narrow is plausible on a 15-20 year horizon if VantageScore execution is strong.

## Fuentes de Moat Identificadas

| Fuente | Presente | Evidencia | Durabilidad | Trayectoria |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Cost advantage | PARTIAL | Asset-light model, 82% GM, 47% OpM, near-zero marginal cost per score. But not a cost advantage vs competitors -- VantageScore can produce scores at lower cost ($0-4.50 vs FICO $4.95-10). | 10+ years (operational efficiency) | -> (stable, not a primary moat source) |
| Network effects | YES | Indirect: More lenders using FICO -> more historical data -> better model validation -> more lender trust. Data network: 30 years of loan performance data correlated with FICO scores. | 15-20 years | v (weakening -- VantageScore building own data corpus via 42B scores/year) |
| Intangible assets | YES (PRIMARY) | Regulatory entrenchment in >90% of lending decisions. 30-year track record embedded in all regulatory frameworks (Basel, Dodd-Frank compliance, state regulations, internal bank policies). Brand recognition universal. FICO 10T still pending FHFA approval. | 15-20 years | v (weakening -- FHFA broke the GSE monopoly Jul 2025) |
| Switching costs | YES (PRIMARY) | Model validation costs (12-24 months), system integration (LOS, underwriting, pricing engines), staff retraining, historical data recalibration, regulatory compliance documentation. Estimated switching cost: $5-50M per large lender + 12-24 months timeline. | 15-20 years | v (weakening -- FHFA forcing the door open, but costs remain real) |
| Efficient scale | YES | US credit scoring market is ~$4-5B TAM. Only 2 meaningful competitors (FICO + VantageScore). High barriers to entry for any third entrant. The market cannot profitably support more than 2-3 scoring models due to validation/adoption costs. | 20+ years | -> (stable -- no third entrant emerging) |

## Detailed Moat Source Analysis

### 1. Intangible Assets: Regulatory Entrenchment (Score: 4/5 -- was 5/5 pre-2025)

**What makes this extraordinary:**
FICO's position is not merely a brand -- it is woven into the regulatory and operational fabric of the entire US consumer lending system. For 30+ years, FICO was the ONLY score accepted by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for conforming mortgages (~50% of all US mortgage originations, ~70% of market via GSEs). This was not a market choice -- it was a regulatory mandate.

**Evidence of regulatory depth:**
- 90%+ of top US lenders use FICO for credit decisions (pre-VantageScore)
- Every loan officer, underwriter, and regulator trained on FICO score interpretation
- Basel III/Dodd-Frank compliance frameworks built around FICO thresholds
- State-level regulations reference FICO scores specifically in many jurisdictions
- Credit risk models at every major bank calibrated to FICO score distributions

**What changed (Jul 2025):**
FHFA Director William Pulte approved VantageScore 4.0 for immediate use in conforming mortgages. This is the single most important threat to FICO's moat in its history. However:
- Approval != adoption. Lenders CAN use VantageScore; they are not REQUIRED to switch.
- FICO still controls the "standard" -- every lender's existing infrastructure is FICO-calibrated.
- FICO 10T is still being negotiated with FHFA for future approval, keeping FICO in the upgrade cycle.

**Pricing power evidence (the ultimate moat test):**
- FICO raised prices from $0.60 -> $3.50 -> $4.95 -> $10.00 per score over the past decade
- This is a >15x increase with minimal volume loss -- extraordinary pricing power
- The Mortgage Direct program ($4.95 + $33 funded-loan fee) is projected to generate $300M incremental revenue in CY2026
- Senator Hawley called for DOJ antitrust investigation -- you only get that when you have monopoly pricing power

**Why I score 4/5 (not 5/5):**
The FHFA approval fundamentally broke the regulatory barrier that protected FICO's monopoly. It is no longer a de jure monopoly. The question is whether the de facto monopoly survives. I believe it does for 10-15 years, but the trajectory is downward.

### 2. Switching Costs (Score: 4/5)

**What makes switching from FICO expensive:**

1. **Model Validation (12-24 months):** Lenders must validate that VantageScore produces equivalent or better risk assessment outcomes. This requires parallel-running both models, analyzing default predictions against actual performance data, and documenting findings for regulators. Estimated cost: $2-10M for a large lender.

2. **System Integration:** FICO scores are embedded in:
   - Loan Origination Systems (LOS)
   - Underwriting decision engines
   - Risk-based pricing models
   - Portfolio risk management tools
   - Regulatory reporting systems
   - Secondary market selling systems
   Replacing FICO in all these touchpoints is a multi-year IT project.

3. **Historical Data Recalibration:** 30 years of loan performance data indexed to FICO scores. Rebuilding loss curves, default models, and pricing algorithms for VantageScore requires years of parallel data accumulation.

4. **Staff Retraining:** Every loan officer knows intuitively what a "720 FICO" means. VantageScore uses the same 300-850 range but distributions differ. Retraining thousands of employees takes time.

5. **Regulatory Documentation:** All internal compliance documentation, audit trails, and regulatory filings reference FICO. Changing requires legal review and regulatory approval.

**Key counter-argument:** The FHFA is actively REDUCING switching costs by mandating VantageScore acceptance at GSE level. This removes the biggest single barrier (GSE approval). But operational switching costs within lender organizations remain very real.

**Evidence of stickiness:**
- Despite VantageScore being available in non-mortgage products since 2006, FICO still has ~90% share of lending decisions
- Even with a 2x price increase to $10/score, lenders have not mass-migrated
- VantageScore usage grew 55% in 2024 to 42B scores, but vast majority is in consumer-facing products (Credit Karma, bank apps), NOT in actual lending decisions

### 3. Efficient Scale (Score: 4/5)

The US credit scoring market is a natural duopoly at best:
- Only 2 models have GSE approval (FICO Classic + VantageScore 4.0)
- FICO 10T pending approval
- No third model can realistically gain GSE approval (5+ year process)
- Building a credible competitor requires billions of data points, decades of track record, and regulatory relationships
- Market TAM of ~$4-5B does not support more than 2-3 competitors with the required infrastructure

### 4. Network Effects (Score: 3/5)

FICO benefits from data network effects:
- More lenders using FICO -> more loan performance data -> better model accuracy -> more lender confidence
- 30 years of performance data creates irreplicable historical correlation dataset
- However, this advantage is gradually eroding: VantageScore now processes 42B scores/year, building its own data corpus

The network effect is REAL but not as strong as in platform businesses (no direct user-to-user interaction). It is more accurately described as a "data moat" -- the historical performance data is irreplicable in the short term but can be approximated over 10+ years.

## Evidencia Cuantitativa

### FICO vs Peer Group (Financial Data & Analytics)

| Metrica | FICO | MSCI | S&P Global | Moody's | Verisk | Sector Median |
|---------|------|------|------------|---------|--------|---------------|
| Gross Margin | 82.2% | 83.3% | ~70% | ~73% | ~67% | ~73% |
| Operating Margin | 47.0% | 56.4% | ~50% adj | ~42% | ~55% adj | ~50% |
| FCF Margin | 37.1% | ~38% | ~35% | ~30% | ~35% | ~35% |
| Revenue CAGR (3yr) | +13.1% | ~12% | ~10% | ~15% | ~7% | ~11% |
| Net Debt/EBITDA | 3.0x | ~3.0x | ~2.0x | ~2.5x | ~2.0x | ~2.5x |

**FICO vs Peer Differential:**
- Gross Margin: +9.2pp vs sector median -- STRONG evidence of pricing power and moat
- Operating Margin: ~-3pp vs sector median -- slightly below due to R&D investment and software segment drag
- FCF Margin: +2pp vs sector median -- solid
- Revenue growth: +2pp above median -- driven by aggressive pricing power

### ROIC vs WACC (Key Moat Metric)

| Metrica | FICO | Analysis |
|---------|------|----------|
| ROIC (FY2022) | 43.8% | Consistently exceptional |
| ROIC (FY2023) | 47.0% | Improving |
| ROIC (FY2024) | 50.3% | Improving |
| ROIC (FY2025) | 86.0% | Extraordinary (possibly distorted by negative equity from buybacks) |
| WACC | 10.7% | Market cost of capital |
| ROIC-WACC Spread | +75.2pp | Among the highest of ANY public company |
| ROIC > WACC: 4/4 years | 100% consistency in available data | WIDE moat indicator |

**CRITICAL NOTE on ROIC:** FICO's ROIC is distorted upward by its heavily negative equity (aggressive share buybacks have made book equity negative). The 86% ROIC is economically real in the sense that FICO generates extraordinary returns relative to the capital invested in the business, but it overstates the underlying business economics somewhat. Even adjusting for this, ROIC is likely 30-50%+ on a normalized basis -- still exceptional and clearly above WACC.

### Revenue Segment Breakdown (FY2025)

| Segment | Revenue | % Total | Growth YoY | Moat Contribution |
|---------|---------|---------|------------|-------------------|
| Scores (B2B) | ~$900M+ | ~55% | +25-34% | PRIMARY moat source |
| Scores (B2C) | ~$280M | ~15% | ~5% | Consumer awareness |
| Software | ~$822M | ~40% | ~2-4% | SECONDARY moat (switching costs) |
| **Total** | **~$2.0B** | **100%** | **+16%** | |

### Software Segment Detail (Second Moat Layer)

| Metrica | Value | Trend |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Platform ARR Growth | +16-18% YoY | Accelerating |
| Non-Platform ARR | -2% YoY | Declining (legacy) |
| Platform DBNRR | 112-115% | Strong expansion |
| Non-Platform DBNRR | 97% | Slight contraction |
| Total Software DBNRR | 102-103% | Stable |
| Gartner/Forrester Position | Leader in AI Decisioning | Recognized |

**Software as a moat enhancer:** The FICO Platform creates an independent switching cost moat. Banks using FICO's decision management software for fraud detection, customer management, and compliance become deeply integrated. This software moat is INDEPENDENT of the Scores moat and provides diversification against VantageScore disruption.

## VantageScore Threat Analysis: The Central Question

### What the Market Believes (Bear Case)
"FICO's monopoly is broken. VantageScore + FHFA + bureau revolt + CFPB pricing scrutiny = moat erosion. The stock deserves to trade at 25-30x earnings, not 50x."

### My Independent Assessment

**VantageScore's Advantages:**
1. **Price:** $0-4.50 vs FICO $4.95-10.00 per score -- massive cost advantage
2. **Bureau backing:** Owned by Experian, TransUnion, Equifax -- they have $300B+ reason to displace FICO
3. **Predictive performance:** Urban Institute research found VantageScore 4.0 up to 15% more predictive than Classic FICO
4. **Inclusion:** Scores 33M more consumers than FICO using alternative data
5. **Regulatory approval:** FHFA-approved for GSE mortgages (Jul 2025)
6. **Volume:** 42B scores used in 2024, growing 55% YoY

**VantageScore's Disadvantages (the adoption barriers):**
1. **30-year infrastructure gap:** Every lender's systems are FICO-calibrated
2. **Model validation inertia:** 12-24 months minimum to validate new scoring model
3. **Historical data absence:** No 30-year loan performance dataset correlated with VantageScore
4. **Lender conservatism:** Mortgage lenders are the most conservative adopters in finance
5. **Dual-score costs:** Running both models in parallel INCREASES costs short-term
6. **Perception gap:** Loan officers intuitively understand FICO; VantageScore scores are "unfamiliar"
7. **FICO counter-moves:** Mortgage Direct program ($4.95 direct pricing) neutralizes price advantage

### Realistic Adoption Timeline

| Timeframe | VantageScore Market Share (Mortgage Decisions) | Confidence |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 2026 | <5% | High -- Too early for meaningful adoption; lenders still evaluating |
| 2028 | 5-15% | Medium -- Early adopters (smaller lenders, credit unions) |
| 2030 | 15-25% | Medium -- Major lenders begin partial migration |
| 2035 | 25-40% | Low -- Depends heavily on execution, regulation, FICO response |

**Key assumption:** FICO does NOT stand still. The Mortgage Direct program demonstrates strategic agility. FICO 10T (incorporating trended data, BNPL) could further enhance its competitive position if FHFA approves it.

### FICO's Strategic Response Assessment

FICO has shown surprising strategic nimbleness:
1. **Mortgage Direct License Program (Oct 2025):** Bypasses credit bureaus entirely, offering $4.95 direct pricing. Projects $300M incremental revenue in CY2026. This simultaneously:
   - Reduces the price gap vs VantageScore
   - Attacks the credit bureaus' economic incentive to push VantageScore
   - Creates a direct lender relationship (higher switching cost)

2. **FICO 10T Development:** Next-generation model with trended data. Pending FHFA approval. If approved, it competes on features with VantageScore 4.0.

3. **Software Platform Expansion:** Platform ARR growing 16-18%, creating independent moat via decision management integration.

4. **International Expansion:** Available in 40+ countries. US disruption does not affect international growth.

## Amenazas al Moat

| Amenaza | Probabilidad | Impacto | Horizonte |
|---------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| VantageScore gains >25% mortgage market share | Media (35%) | Alto (Narrows moat) | 5-10 anos |
| CFPB/DOJ pricing regulation or antitrust action | Media-Baja (20%) | Medio-Alto (caps revenue growth) | 2-5 anos |
| AI/alternative data replaces traditional scoring | Baja (15%) | Alto (fundamental disruption) | 10-15 anos |
| Credit bureaus collectively boycott FICO | Baja (10%) | Muy Alto (existential) | 3-5 anos |
| Open banking / fintech alternative scoring | Baja (15%) | Medio (niche erosion) | 5-10 anos |
| VantageScore proves dramatically more predictive | Baja (10%) | Alto (regulatory pressure) | 3-5 anos |

### Near-Term Threats (0-3 years)
1. **Pricing scrutiny:** Senator Hawley's DOJ investigation request, CFPB oversight. If pricing is capped or regulated, the extraordinary revenue growth from price hikes stops. Probability: 20%.
2. **Bureau price war:** Equifax offering VantageScore at $4.50 with free bundling. Creates noise but unlikely to cause rapid FICO displacement given switching costs.

### Medium-Term Threats (3-10 years)
1. **VantageScore gaining meaningful mortgage share:** The most credible threat. 5-15% share by 2028 seems realistic. This alone does not break the moat -- FICO can retain 70-80% of mortgage decisions and still have a Wide moat. The risk is if the trajectory accelerates.
2. **FICO 10T fails to get FHFA approval:** Would leave FICO stuck on an older model while VantageScore 4.0 is positioned as the "modern" alternative.

### Long-Term Threats (10+ years)
1. **AI-native credit scoring:** If machine learning models using alternative data (utility payments, rent, behavioral data) prove dramatically more predictive than traditional bureau-based scoring, both FICO and VantageScore face disruption. But this is 10-15 years away from regulatory acceptance.
2. **Full VantageScore displacement:** Even in the most aggressive scenario, I estimate FICO retains 50%+ share in 2035. The historical data advantage and regulatory entrenchment are that deep.

---

## Escenarios de Erosion

### Scenario 1: Gradual Erosion (Most Likely -- 55% probability)
VantageScore gains 15-25% of mortgage decisions by 2030. FICO retains 70-80% share but loses pricing power. Revenue growth slows from 15%+ to 5-8% as pricing increases become politically impossible. Moat remains WIDE but narrows over time. Stock de-rates from 50x to 30-35x earnings.

**Moat reclassification timeline:** WIDE through 2035, potentially NARROW by 2040.

### Scenario 2: Pricing Regulation (20% probability)
CFPB or Congressional action caps FICO score pricing. Revenue growth drops to 0-3% for Scores segment. Software becomes the growth engine. Moat remains WIDE (embedded infrastructure unchanged) but economic rent extraction is capped. Stock de-rates to 25-30x.

**Moat reclassification timeline:** WIDE remains (moat is about position, not just pricing), but economic returns compress.

### Scenario 3: FICO Adapts Successfully (25% probability)
FICO 10T gets FHFA approval. Mortgage Direct program captures bureau economics. Software platform accelerates. VantageScore gains only 5-10% mortgage share by 2030. FICO maintains 85%+ of lending decisions and continues moderate pricing increases. Moat remains WIDE and STABLE.

**Moat reclassification timeline:** WIDE through 2040+.

## Moat Scoring (5 dimensions, 1-5 each, max 25)

| Dimension | Score | Evidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Brand Recognition / Network Effects | 4/5 | Universal brand in credit, 30yr data corpus, but VantageScore building alternative network at 42B scores/yr |
| Switching Costs | 5/5 | 12-24 month model validation, system integration across entire lending stack, retraining, regulatory documentation. Even with FHFA approval, operational switching costs remain extremely high. |
| Cost Advantage / Efficient Scale | 3/5 | Efficient scale (natural duopoly), near-zero marginal cost. But FICO has COST DISADVANTAGE vs VantageScore on price ($10 vs $4.50). The moat here is efficient scale, not cost leadership. |
| Intangible Assets (regulatory, IP, data) | 4/5 | 30yr regulatory entrenchment, proprietary scoring algorithms, irreplicable historical performance dataset. Downgraded from 5 due to FHFA breaking the de jure monopoly. |
| Pricing Power | 4/5 | Demonstrated 15x price increase over a decade with minimal volume loss. Mortgage Direct at $4.95 + $33/funded-loan creates new revenue layer. But pricing power is being challenged by VantageScore/bureau price war and regulatory scrutiny. Downgraded from 5 due to political/regulatory ceiling. |

**Total Moat Score: 20/25**

---

## Historical Moat Evolution

| Period | Moat Status | Key Factor |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| 1990-2010 | WIDE (Unassailable) | FICO was literally the only score GSEs accepted. De jure monopoly. |
| 2010-2022 | WIDE (Strong) | VantageScore created (2006) but gained zero traction in mortgage. FICO began aggressive pricing. |
| 2022-2025 | WIDE (Under Review) | FHFA selected VantageScore 4.0 + FICO 10T (Oct 2022). 3-year implementation timeline announced. |
| Jul 2025-Present | WIDE (Eroding) | FHFA approved VantageScore 4.0 for immediate GSE use. First real competitive threat in 30 years. |

**Trajectory:** The moat went from "impregnable fortress" to "very strong castle with a crack in the wall." The crack is real but the castle still stands. It would take years of sustained competitive pressure to reduce this to Narrow.

---

## Software Segment Moat Contribution

The Software segment (~40% of revenue) provides a SEPARATE and INDEPENDENT moat layer:

1. **Decision Management Platform:** Banks integrate FICO Platform for fraud detection, customer management, origination decisions, collections optimization. Once integrated, switching costs are extremely high (similar to Salesforce or SAP lock-in).

2. **Platform ARR growing 16-18%:** Indicates healthy demand and expansion within existing customers.

3. **DBNRR of 112-115% (platform):** Customers are spending MORE over time -- classic sign of deep product-market fit and high switching costs.

4. **Forrester/Gartner Leader:** Recognized as leader in AI Decisioning Platforms, creating trust moat.

5. **Diversification value:** Even if Scores moat erodes faster than expected, the Software segment provides a floor on enterprise value. At ~$822M revenue with SaaS characteristics, this segment alone would justify a significant valuation.

**Assessment:** The Software segment adds ~5 years of durability to the overall moat assessment. Even in the worst-case Scores scenario, FICO is not going to zero.

---

## Discrepancias con Thesis (if applicable)

The fundamental-analyst thesis is still in progress (R1). Based on the sector view preliminary entry estimate of $950-1050, I would note:

1. **The sector view calls the moat "WIDE but under first real threat"** -- I agree with this assessment. My independent research confirms this classification.

2. **If the fundamental-analyst rates the moat as WIDE without noting erosion trajectory,** I would disagree. The trajectory is clearly downward (from unassailable to challenged), and any moat assessment that does not prominently feature the VantageScore threat would be incomplete.

3. **If the fundamental-analyst assigns QS >80 for moat evidence,** I would push back. The moat evidence score should reflect the erosion trajectory. I would score Moat Evidence at 17-20/25, consistent with the quality_scorer.py output (17/25 with market position at 0/8 manual -- should be 8/8 given #1 position, bringing total to ~25/25 on a raw basis but adjusted down to 18-20/25 for the VantageScore erosion trajectory).

---

## 🔄 META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres

1. **VantageScore actual adoption rate in lending DECISIONS (not consumer-facing products):** The 42B scores/year figure includes massive consumer-facing usage (Credit Karma, bank apps). The number that matters is lending DECISION usage, which I could not find a precise figure for. My estimate of <10% for actual underwriting decisions could be wrong in either direction.

2. **FICO Mortgage Direct program actual uptake:** The $300M incremental revenue projection for CY2026 is from market analysts, not FICO guidance. Q1 FY2026 results (Jan 2026) showed 29% Scores growth, but it is unclear how much is from Mortgage Direct vs price increases vs volume. Need to track this in Q2/Q3 results.

3. **FICO 10T FHFA approval timeline:** If FICO 10T gets approved quickly, it significantly strengthens the moat (FICO owns BOTH approved models). If approval drags on, VantageScore has a competitive advantage with a more modern model.

4. **Credit bureau collective action risk:** Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax OWN VantageScore AND control the data that feeds FICO scores. In theory, they could make FICO scoring more expensive or difficult by altering data delivery terms. This is a low-probability but high-impact risk I could not fully assess.

5. **ROIC distortion from negative equity:** FICO's 86% ROIC is mathematically correct but economically misleading due to cumulative buybacks creating negative book equity. A normalized ROIC (adjusting for this) would be 30-50%, still excellent but not 86%. I flagged this but could not calculate a precise normalized figure without detailed capital structure analysis.

### Sugerencias de Mejora

1. **Create a "regulatory moat" sub-framework:** FICO's moat is primarily regulatory/institutional, which is different from brand or technology moats. The moat-framework skill should have a specific section for evaluating regulatory entrenchment moats, including:
   - Regulatory capture assessment
   - Policy change probability analysis
   - Timeline to regulatory disruption

2. **Track VantageScore adoption as a leading indicator:** Suggest adding "VantageScore mortgage lending share" as a specific kill condition metric in the FICO thesis. If this exceeds 20% in any quarter, it would trigger an immediate moat reassessment.

3. **Peer comparison tool for financial data companies:** FICO, SPGI, MSCI, MCO, VRSK share similar moat characteristics. A dedicated comparison framework would be useful for this sector.

### Anomalias Detectadas

1. **FICO stock is -39% from highs, but Q1 FY2026 shows 16% revenue growth and 29% Scores growth.** The disconnect between operational performance and stock price suggests the market is pricing in future moat erosion, not current business deterioration. This creates a potential opportunity if the market is over-discounting the threat.

2. **VantageScore claims 42B scores in 2024 (+55% YoY) and "9 of top 10 US banks" as users.** BUT this is mostly consumer-facing (free scores, educational tools). The conflation of consumer-facing usage with lending-decision usage is misleading and VantageScore's PR leverages this ambiguity. Independent analysis needed.

3. **FICO's Mortgage Direct program simultaneously helps AND hurts:** It reduces the price gap vs VantageScore (good for retention) but also attacks the credit bureaus who own VantageScore (increasing their incentive to push VantageScore harder). The competitive dynamics are more complex than a simple "FICO adapts" narrative suggests.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator

1. **How should we weight the VantageScore threat in the QS Moat Evidence score?** The quality_scorer.py gives 17/25 for moat (10/10 GM Premium, 0/8 Market Position manual, 7/7 ROIC Persistence). Market Position should be 8/8 (#1 in credit scoring) but the erosion trajectory suggests an adjusted score of 18-20/25. What is the right approach?

2. **Should the thesis treat FICO primarily as a "Scores" business (moat under threat) or a "Scores + Software" business (moat more resilient)?** The answer significantly affects the fair value calculation. I lean toward the combined view -- the Software segment provides meaningful downside protection.

3. **Is the -39% price drop sufficient to compensate for the moat erosion risk?** This is ultimately a valuation question, but the moat assessment informs it. Even with moat erosion, FICO remains a 82% GM, 37% FCF margin business growing revenue at 13%+ with ROIC far above WACC. The question is whether the market has over-corrected.
