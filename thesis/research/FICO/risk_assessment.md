# Risk Assessment: FICO (Fair Isaac Corporation)

## Fecha: 2026-02-11

## Risk Score: HIGH

**Rationale:** Multiple correlated risks across competitive, regulatory, financial, and valuation categories. The core risk -- moat erosion from VantageScore + bureau revolt + regulatory pressure -- is a multi-year structural threat that is unprecedented in FICO's 30-year monopoly history. The -39% drop from ATH prices in some risk but the stock still trades at ~50x P/E, leaving significant downside if the bear case materializes.

## Top 5 Riesgos Criticos (expanded from 3 due to severity)

### 1. VantageScore Adoption + Bureau Alliance = Coordinated Moat Attack

- **Categoria:** Competitive
- **Descripcion:** For the first time in 30+ years, FICO faces a coordinated attack on its mortgage scoring monopoly. VantageScore 4.0, owned by the three credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, Equifax), was approved by FHFA in July 2025 for GSE-backed mortgages. The bureaus have financial incentive to displace FICO and are pricing aggressively: Experian offers VantageScore FREE indefinitely, TransUnion at $4/score (free through 2026), Equifax at $4.50/score (free for certain customers through 2026). Compare to FICO's $10/score through bureaus or $4.95 direct.
- **Evidencia:**
  - VantageScore market penetration in mortgages surged 166% YoY in 2025, with 3,700 lenders adopting
  - VantageScore scores 33 million more consumers than FICO (including 5 million "credit invisibles")
  - Equifax estimated FICO's price doubling costs the industry ~$100M annually
  - Equifax, Experian, TransUnion all publicly criticized FICO's pricing
  - FHFA finalized implementation January 1, 2026
- **Probabilidad:** 60-70% that VantageScore captures meaningful mortgage scoring share (>15%) within 3-5 years
- **Impacto si materializa:**
  - Mortgage scoring = ~44% of Scores segment revenue; Scores = ~60% of total revenue
  - So mortgage scoring = ~26% of total revenue ($512M annual pace)
  - If VantageScore captures 20% of mortgage scoring: -5% total revenue hit (~$100M)
  - But pricing pressure across ALL scoring (not just mortgage) could compress margins 5-10pp
  - Estimated stock impact: -20% to -35% from current levels if market re-rates moat as "narrowing"
- **Mitigante:** FICO claims 10T is 18% better at default prediction than VantageScore 4.0. Lender inertia and model validation requirements create 2-3 year friction. FICO Direct program bypasses bureaus. But the bureaus OWN VantageScore -- this is an existential conflict of interest.
- **Kill condition?:** YES -- If VantageScore captures >25% of GSE mortgage scoring volume within 18 months of full implementation (by mid-2027), the monopoly thesis is broken.

### 2. Valuation Risk: P/E 50x with Decelerating Growth Narrative

- **Categoria:** Valoracion
- **Descripcion:** Despite the -39% drop from ATH (~$2,218 to ~$1,363), FICO still trades at ~50x trailing P/E. This premium was historically justified by monopolistic pricing power + high-teens growth. If the market re-rates FICO from "monopoly compounder" to "competitive utility" (P/E 25-35x), significant downside remains. FY2026 guidance missed consensus: revenue $2.35B vs $2.44B expected, EPS $38.17 vs $40.70 expected.
- **Evidencia:**
  - Current P/E: ~50x trailing, ~36x forward (if FY2026 EPS ~$38)
  - 3-year average P/E: ~55x -- already compressing
  - Comparable Equifax trades at 14x forward (vs 20x historical); TransUnion at 16x (vs 22x historical)
  - Revenue guidance $2.35B = only 18% growth vs FY2025 $1.99B (decelerating from 16% in FY25)
  - Q1 2026 beat on EPS ($7.33 vs $7.07) but shares fell on guidance miss
- **Probabilidad:** 50-60% of continued multiple compression over 12 months
- **Impacto si materializa:**
  - At P/E 35x forward and EPS $38: stock = $1,330 (roughly current, implying limited upside)
  - At P/E 25x forward and EPS $38: stock = $950 (-30% from current)
  - At P/E 20x forward and EPS $35 (bear): stock = $700 (-49% from current)
  - The "correct" multiple depends entirely on the VantageScore outcome
- **Mitigante:** Strong Q1 beat suggests guidance is conservative. CEO said "well positioned to exceed guidance." Earnings growth ~20%+ if pricing holds. But the market is clearly NOT giving credit for conservative guidance.
- **Kill condition?:** YES -- If forward P/E compresses below 30x with deteriorating earnings growth (<10%), the stock becomes a multiple compression trap with no recovery catalyst.

### 3. Regulatory Overhang: DOJ Antitrust + Pricing Regulation

- **Categoria:** Regulatorio
- **Descripcion:** Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) formally called on DOJ Antitrust Division to investigate FICO for anticompetitive practices and repeated price hikes (April 2025). FICO raised prices from $3.50 to $4.95 to $10/score over 4 years -- a 150% CAGR in pricing. The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) has publicly called the system "flawed, outdated, and anticompetitive." If DOJ opens a formal investigation or Congress legislates pricing caps, FICO's pricing power -- the core of the thesis -- evaporates.
- **Evidencia:**
  - Senator Hawley's formal letter to DOJ citing "monopoly power" (April 2025)
  - Community Home Lenders Association (CHLA) supporting congressional investigation
  - MBA president publicly condemning FICO pricing as "gouging consumers"
  - FICO's pricing CAGR of ~150% over 4 years is extreme by any standard
  - Per-loan credit costs could reach $300+ in 2026, during a housing affordability crisis
- **Probabilidad:** 30-40% of formal DOJ investigation; 15-20% of legislative action
- **Impacto si materializa:**
  - DOJ investigation: Stock -15% to -25% on announcement, prolonged uncertainty
  - Pricing caps (legislative): Could cut Scores revenue by 30-50%, stock -40% to -60%
  - Even threat of investigation constrains future price hikes
- **Mitigante:** CFPB is being defunded under current administration (funding lapse expected early 2026), reducing one regulatory actor. DOJ antitrust investigations take years. But the political optics of "monopoly gouging homebuyers" are toxic for both parties.
- **Kill condition?:** YES -- If DOJ opens formal antitrust investigation OR Congress introduces pricing cap legislation with bipartisan support.

### 4. Financial Risk: Leveraged Balance Sheet + Negative Equity + Buybacks at Premium

- **Categoria:** Financiero
- **Descripcion:** FICO has $3.2B in total debt, $162M in cash (net debt $3.1B, ~3.0x ND/EBITDA). The company has NEGATIVE shareholder equity (D/E ratio -1.75 to -1.99) due to aggressive share buybacks. The $1B buyback program was authorized when the stock was near ATH (~$1,900+). The debt-to-assets ratio is 1.73 -- meaning liabilities exceed assets. Interest coverage is 7.0x (adequate but not exceptional for a company with monopoly economics). If revenue growth decelerates and FCF declines, the leverage becomes a constraint.
- **Evidencia:**
  - Net debt: $3.1B; Net Debt/EBITDA: 3.0x
  - Negative shareholder equity (-$1.75 to -$1.99 D/E ratio)
  - Debt-to-assets: 1.73x (liabilities > assets)
  - Interest coverage: 7.0x (declining from higher levels)
  - $1B buyback authorized near peak valuation
  - Short-term debt: $400M (needs refinancing)
  - No dividend (0% yield, 0% payout)
- **Probabilidad:** 25-35% of financial stress if revenue growth decelerates materially
- **Impacto si materializa:**
  - If FCF drops 20% (from $739M to ~$590M) and debt refinancing costs rise, coverage drops to ~5.5x
  - Negative equity limits financial flexibility in a downturn
  - Buybacks at premium prices = capital destruction (paying $1,900/share for stock now at $1,363)
  - Could force suspension of buybacks, which removes the key EPS growth lever
- **Mitigante:** FCF is strong and growing ($739M in FY2025, +21% YoY). FICO generates cash even in downturns. 7x interest coverage is adequate. But the leverage leaves no margin for error.
- **Kill condition?:** NO as standalone risk. But combined with revenue deceleration (Risk #1 + #3), becomes material. Kill condition: Net Debt/EBITDA > 4.0x AND interest coverage < 5.0x.

### 5. Insider Selling: Massive, Persistent, No Purchases

- **Categoria:** Market / Governance
- **Descripcion:** FICO insiders have conducted 127 sales and ZERO purchases in the last 6 months. CEO Will Lansing sold 26,443 shares for an estimated $42.1M. CFO Steven Weber sold 1,426 shares (33.7% of his holdings in that class). VP Eva Manolis and Marc McMoreis also sold. This is not occasional diversification -- it is systematic, high-volume selling with zero offsetting purchases from any insider.
- **Evidencia:**
  - 127 insider sales, 0 purchases in 6 months
  - CEO sold $42.1M in stock over 6 months
  - CFO sold 33.7% of his shares in one class
  - No insider has purchased shares despite -39% decline from ATH
  - If insiders believed the stock was cheap at $1,300-1,400, at least one would buy
- **Probabilidad:** N/A (already occurred, the signal is the data itself)
- **Impacto:** Directional signal. Insiders know the business best. When ALL insiders sell and NONE buy during a 39% decline, it suggests they do not believe the stock is significantly undervalued at current levels. This is a red flag for any value thesis.
- **Mitigante:** Many sales may be pre-scheduled 10b5-1 plans. Insider ownership at 2.7% means their stakes are relatively modest. But the complete absence of buying is notable.
- **Kill condition?:** NO as standalone. But informs conviction level. If combined with moat erosion evidence, insider selling confirms the bear case.

## Risk Category Deep Dive

### COMPETITIVE RISKS

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Timeline | Status |
|------|------------|--------|----------|--------|
| VantageScore captures >15% mortgage share | 60-70% | High | 2-4 years | ACTIVE -- bureaus pricing at $0-4.50 vs FICO $10 |
| Bureau alliance escalates (withhold data?) | 30-40% | Very High | 1-2 years | WATCH -- bureaus own VantageScore, incentive to promote |
| Fintech alternative scoring (Upstart, etc.) | 20-30% | Medium | 3-5 years | EARLY -- niche, not mortgage-grade yet |
| Open banking disrupts credit model | 15-25% | Medium | 5-10 years | EARLY -- UK ahead, US lagging |
| AI-native scoring models emerge | 20-30% | Medium-High | 3-7 years | EARLY -- regulatory hurdles for explainability |

**Correlation:** VantageScore adoption and bureau alliance are HIGHLY CORRELATED (same actors, same incentive). Regulatory actions amplify both. These are not independent risks.

### REGULATORY RISKS

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Timeline | Status |
|------|------------|--------|----------|--------|
| DOJ formal antitrust investigation | 30-40% | High | 1-3 years | ACTIVE -- Hawley letter, bipartisan pressure |
| Congressional pricing cap legislation | 15-20% | Very High | 2-4 years | EARLY -- but housing affordability is bipartisan |
| FHFA further pro-VantageScore actions | 50-60% | High | 0-2 years | ACTIVE -- FHFA already mandated dual scoring |
| CFPB enforcement action | 10-15% | Medium | Uncertain | REDUCED -- CFPB being defunded |
| State-level regulation | 10-15% | Low-Medium | 2-5 years | WATCH |

**Note:** The CFPB defunding under the current administration is actually a mixed blessing for FICO. It removes one regulatory threat but may embolden FICO to raise prices further, which in turn increases political backlash and DOJ risk.

### FINANCIAL RISKS

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Timeline | Status |
|------|------------|--------|----------|--------|
| Leverage constrains during downturn | 25-35% | High | Recession-dependent | LATENT |
| Buybacks at premium destroy value | 60% (already happening) | Medium | Ongoing | ACTIVE |
| Debt refinancing at higher rates | 30-40% | Medium | $400M short-term | WATCH |
| FCF decline if pricing constrained | 30-40% | High | 2-4 years | CONTINGENT on Risk #1/#3 |

### OPERATIONAL RISKS

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Timeline | Status |
|------|------------|--------|----------|--------|
| CEO Lansing departure/succession | 20-30% | Medium | CEO since 2012, locked through 2028 | LOW-TERM |
| Software pivot execution failure | 30-40% | Medium | Platform ARR 34% of total ARR | ACTIVE |
| Bureau data access dispute | 15-25% | Very High | Unlikely but catastrophic | TAIL |
| Key talent loss (data scientists) | 20% | Medium | Competitive AI talent market | WATCH |

**CEO Risk Detail (Paragon Intel):** Analysis suggests Lansing is a strong steward of the core Scores business but may lack vision for the software platform transformation. Software segment grew only 2% in Q1 2026 vs Scores +29%. If the thesis depends on software diversification, CEO capability is a risk.

---

## Revenue Concentration Analysis

| Revenue Source | % of Total | Growth (Latest) | VantageScore Threat |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Scores: Mortgage | ~26% | +53% QoQ (Q4 2025) | DIRECT -- highest risk |
| Scores: Auto | ~10-12% | +23% (Q3 2025) | INDIRECT -- VantageScore expanding to auto |
| Scores: Other (cards, personal) | ~12-15% | Stable | LOW -- card issuers deeply embedded with FICO |
| Software: Platform | ~12% (growing) | +17-30% YoY ARR | NONE |
| Software: Non-Platform | ~25% | -3% YoY | NONE |

**Critical dependency:** Mortgage scoring (~26% of total revenue) is the segment most exposed to VantageScore disruption. If FHFA actions cause 20-30% share loss in mortgage, that is a 5-8% total revenue hit. But pricing pressure spreads: auto lenders will use VantageScore as leverage to negotiate lower FICO fees.

---

## "Perfect Storm" Scenario

**Scenario:** VantageScore captures >20% mortgage share + DOJ investigation announced + P/E compresses to 25x + revenue growth slows to <10%

**Probability:** 10-15% (correlated risks make this more likely than independent probability would suggest)

**Pathway:**
1. H1 2026: VantageScore adoption accelerates in mortgage (free pricing from bureaus)
2. H2 2026: FICO FY2026 revenue guidance revision downward ($2.2B vs $2.35B)
3. 2026-2027: DOJ opens preliminary antitrust inquiry
4. Market re-rates: P/E compresses from ~50x to ~25x forward
5. EPS decelerates from $38 to $32 (pricing pressure + volume loss)

**Price in perfect storm:** $32 EPS x 25x P/E = $800 (approximately -41% from current $1,363)

**Price in moderate bear:** $35 EPS x 30x P/E = $1,050 (-23% from current)

**Price in base case:** $38 EPS x 35x P/E = $1,330 (roughly flat from current)

**Observation:** The current price appears to roughly reflect the BASE CASE. There is limited upside in base case and significant downside in bear/perfect storm. The risk/reward is asymmetric to the downside from current levels.

---

## Is the -39% Drop Adequate?

**My Assessment: PARTIALLY -- but not fully.**

The -39% drop from ATH (~$2,218 to ~$1,363) has priced in:
- The FHFA VantageScore acceptance (initial shock)
- The FY2026 guidance miss
- Some multiple compression (from ~55x to ~50x trailing)

The -39% drop has NOT fully priced in:
- Actual VantageScore adoption data (still early, bureaus giving it away free)
- Potential DOJ investigation (not yet opened)
- Pricing power erosion across non-mortgage segments (auto, cards)
- The structural shift from monopoly to duopoly (which warrants lower terminal P/E)
- The possibility that software revenue cannot offset Scores deceleration

**Critical comparison:** Equifax (14x forward P/E), TransUnion (16x forward P/E). If FICO's moat narrows to "strong but not monopolistic," its appropriate multiple is closer to 25-35x, not 50x. At 30x forward on current consensus EPS, fair value is approximately $1,145 (EUR ~963) -- implying ~16% additional downside from current.

## Riesgos NO Mencionados / Likely Minimized in Thesis

| Riesgo | Severidad | Likely in thesis? | Comentario |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| Bureau data access dispute (nuclear option) | CRITICAL (tail) | Likely NO | If bureaus restrict FICO's access to credit data, game over. Extremely unlikely but existential. |
| Buybacks at premium destroying equity value | HIGH | Likely Minimized | $1B buyback authorized near $1,900. Now stock at $1,363. This is capital destruction. |
| Software segment stagnation (+2% Q1 vs +29% Scores) | HIGH | Likely Minimized | Thesis may over-weight software diversification narrative |
| CEO vision gap for platform transformation | MEDIUM | Likely NO | Paragon Intel analysis suggests Lansing is a maintainer, not a transformer |
| Mortgage concentration (26% of revenue in most threatened segment) | HIGH | Likely Minimized | Easy to cite "only 60% is Scores" without noting 44% of Scores = mortgage |
| Housing market cyclicality amplifying risk | MEDIUM | Likely NO | If mortgage volumes drop (rates stay high) AND VantageScore takes share, double negative |
| Anti-consumer optics of $10/score during affordability crisis | HIGH | Likely NO | Political risk -- housing affordability is bipartisan. FICO = easy villain |
| Credit bureau oligopoly breaking (bi-merge transition) | MEDIUM | Possibly | FHFA is also pushing bi-merge (2 bureaus instead of 3), which restructures the market |

---

## Kill Conditions Sugeridas

1. **VantageScore mortgage share >25% within 18 months of implementation** (by mid-2027) -- indicates monopoly truly broken, not just "accepted but unused"

2. **DOJ opens formal antitrust investigation** -- creates prolonged uncertainty, constrains pricing, precedent for other regulatory actions

3. **FICO Scores revenue growth turns negative for 2 consecutive quarters** -- indicates pricing power + volume both deteriorating simultaneously

4. **Net Debt/EBITDA exceeds 4.0x** -- leverage becomes dangerous given uncertain revenue trajectory

5. **Congress introduces bipartisan pricing cap legislation that passes committee** -- existential threat to the pricing power thesis

6. **Credit bureau restricts or conditions FICO data access** -- nuclear option that breaks the business model (extremely unlikely but must be monitored)

7. **P/E compresses below 25x without earnings growth improvement** -- indicates market has permanently re-rated FICO from "monopoly compounder" to "competitive utility," eliminating recovery potential

---

## Riesgo Agregado

- **Numero de riesgos HIGH + CRITICAL:** 8
- **Riesgos correlacionados:** YES -- Risks #1 (VantageScore), #2 (bureau alliance), #3 (antitrust), #4 (FHFA), and #7 (multiple compression) are all correlated. The VantageScore competitive threat drives regulatory scrutiny which drives multiple compression. These are not independent events.
- **Correlation coefficient (estimated):** 0.6-0.8 between competitive and regulatory risks
- **Risk Score Final:** **HIGH**

**Rationale for HIGH (not VERY HIGH):**
- The business fundamentals are still strong (FCF $739M, ROIC 86%, margins expanding)
- The monopoly takes YEARS to erode, not months
- Management can pivot (FICO Direct, software platform)
- Interest coverage (7x) provides buffer
- But the CORRELATION of risks is what elevates this: if VantageScore succeeds, regulatory pressure intensifies, multiples compress, and the leveraged balance sheet becomes a constraint -- all simultaneously.

---

## 🔄 META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres

1. **VantageScore actual adoption rate:** The 166% YoY growth and 3,700 lenders statistic comes from VantageScore's own PR. Real adoption measured by GSE loan volume percentage is the metric that matters, and I could not find this data. It may be too early (implementation only Jan 1, 2026).

2. **FICO Direct program success:** FICO's strategy to bypass bureaus and go direct to resellers at $4.95/score could work brilliantly OR could backfire by alienating bureau relationships further. I cannot assess adoption of this program yet.

3. **Software segment trajectory:** Platform ARR growth decelerated from 30%+ to 17% and back up in different quarters. Is this lumpy or declining? The Q1 2026 software revenue of +2% total is concerning vs +29% for Scores.

4. **Debt maturity schedule:** I could not find specific debt maturity dates from public search. If significant debt matures in 2026-2027 when revenue trajectory is uncertain, refinancing risk is higher. The $400M short-term debt needs monitoring.

5. **How to quantify the probability that VantageScore adoption STALLS:** The bureaus are giving it away free, but lender inertia is real. Model validation takes 1-2 years. The counter-argument (moat holds) has merit but is difficult to assign precise probability to.

### Riesgos que Podrian Estar Subestimados

1. **Bureau data access risk:** I classified this as "tail risk" but if the bureau-FICO relationship deteriorates further (it is already adversarial), the bureaus have leverage. FICO depends on bureau data to generate scores. This is an asymmetric risk.

2. **Anti-consumer political narrative:** In a housing affordability crisis, "monopoly charges $10 per credit score" is a perfect political target. This could catalyze regulatory action faster than my 2-4 year timeline suggests.

3. **Software segment weakness:** If Scores revenue decelerates AND Software cannot pick up the slack, the "FICO is diversifying" narrative breaks. Software grew only 2% in Q1 2026.

### Discrepancias con Thesis

The thesis (if it exists) likely emphasizes:
- "Monopoly with 90%+ market share" -- TRUE BUT UNDER FIRST REAL ATTACK
- "Pricing power demonstrated by 150% CAGR" -- TRUE BUT THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT TRIGGERED REGULATORY AND COMPETITIVE BACKLASH
- "High ROIC, expanding margins" -- TRUE BUT BACKWARD-LOOKING; forward depends on pricing power sustainability
- "Software platform diversification" -- NASCENT AND UNPROVEN (34% of ARR, but growing slower than Scores)

I would push back hardest on: the assumption that -39% from ATH makes this "cheap." At 50x trailing P/E, FICO is still priced for monopoly economics. If the monopoly is merely "strong competitive position," fair P/E is 25-35x, implying further -16% to -30% downside.

### Sugerencias para el Sistema

1. **Track VantageScore GSE adoption quarterly:** This is THE leading indicator for the FICO thesis. If adoption stays <5% after 12 months of free pricing, the moat is stronger than feared. If >10%, the bear case is accelerating.

2. **Monitor FICO Scores segment growth rate deceleration:** Compare to FY2025 Scores growth rate. Any deceleration is a leading indicator of pricing/volume pressure.

3. **Watch for DOJ announcement:** Set a news alert. A formal investigation announcement would be a kill condition trigger.

4. **Cross-reference with Equifax/TransUnion earnings calls:** The bureaus will discuss VantageScore adoption on their calls. This is an independent data source on the competitive threat.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator

1. What fair value range is the fundamental-analyst arriving at? If the thesis FV implies a P/E > 40x forward, I would flag that as aggressive given the risk matrix above.

2. Should we set a hard MoS floor of 30%+ for FICO given the HIGH risk score? At current price ($1,363 = EUR 1,146), what FV would imply 30% MoS?

3. The -39% drop LOOKS like a fallen angel opportunity, but the risk profile is fundamentally different from LULU (-35%, still monopolistic in athleisure) or ADBE (-30%, software monopoly intact). Should we treat FICO as a special situation requiring higher MoS rather than a Tier A compounder?

4. Given the insider selling pattern (127 sales, 0 purchases), should this automatically lower conviction from HIGH to MEDIUM regardless of fundamental analysis?
