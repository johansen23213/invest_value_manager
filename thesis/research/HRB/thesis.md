# H&R Block (HRB) - Fundamental Analysis

**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Status**: RESEARCH - CONDITIONAL BUY
**Tier**: B (Cyclical/Quality) - MoS required: >=25%

---

## Executive Summary

H&R Block is the #2 US tax preparation company ($3.8B revenue) trading at P/E 8.9x and ~39% off 52-week highs. The sell-off was triggered by (1) merely reaffirming FY2026 guidance rather than raising it, (2) CEO retirement announcement, and (3) debt increase. The business generates strong, predictable FCF ($500-600M/yr) and has been aggressively returning capital (43% of shares retired since 2016). At $39, the stock offers ~30% MoS to base case fair value of $51. However, declining FCF despite revenue growth, negative book value, $1.87B net debt, and real AI/IRS Direct File disruption risks warrant caution.

**Verdict**: Meets MoS threshold for Tier B. Position at 3-4% max given balance sheet risk.

## Business Model

**Three segments:**
1. **Assisted Tax Prep** (~70% revenue) - ~10,000 offices in US + international. Moat here: physical presence + brand trust for complex filers. NAC (net average charge) growing.
2. **DIY Software** (~20% revenue) - Competes vs TurboTax (dominant), TaxAct, FreeTaxUSA. Cheaper than TurboTax ($35-85 vs $39-219). Double-digit WAVE (online) growth.
3. **Financial Products** (~10% revenue) - Emerald Card, refund advances, Spruce banking. Declining (-11% YoY in Q1).

**Seasonality**: Massive. Q3 (Jan-Mar) generates ~60% of annual revenue. Q1 always a loss.

**Capital-light**: Minimal capex (~$70-80M/yr vs $600-800M operating CF). Franchise model for many offices.

## Why 39% Off Highs? (Catalyst Analysis)

1. **Reaffirmed (not raised) FY2026 guidance** - Market wanted a beat-and-raise. EPS guide of $4.85-5.00 was slightly below consensus $4.94.
2. **CEO transition** - Jeff Jones retiring Dec 2025. Uncertainty about new leadership.
3. **Debt spike** - Long-term debt rose from $1.14B to $1.73B in Q1 FY2026 (likely debt-funded buybacks at higher prices). Total debt now $2.25B.
4. **AI disruption narrative** - Market pricing in risk that AI makes tax prep easier/free.
5. **IRS Direct File** - Free government alternative now permanent. 90% user satisfaction.

**Assessment**: Reasons 1-3 are temporary/manageable. Reasons 4-5 are structural but slow-moving. The sell-off looks overdone for a business earning $4.40+/share with declining share count.

---

## Moat Assessment: NARROW

**Sources of moat:**
- **Brand trust** (70+ years) - For complex tax situations, people trust H&R Block
- **Physical network** - 10,000+ offices is unreplicable; competitors have exited physical
- **Switching costs** - Tax history stored, multi-year relationship, fear of IRS audit
- **Regulatory complexity** - US tax code getting MORE complex, not simpler. Tailwind.

**Moat threats:**
- **TurboTax dominance** in DIY (~60% share vs HRB ~15% click share)
- **AI commoditization** - Tax prep is rules-based; AI could automate much of it
- **IRS Direct File** - Free alternative for simple returns
- **No pricing power in DIY** - Commodity product, HRB competes on price

**Moat score: 5/10** - Narrow moat in assisted segment, no moat in DIY. Overall narrow but weakening over 5-10 years.

## Financial Analysis

### Revenue Trend
| Year | Revenue | Growth |
|------|---------|--------|
| FY2022 | $3,463M | - |
| FY2023 | $3,472M | +0.3% |
| FY2024 | $3,610M | +4.0% |
| FY2025 | $3,761M | +4.2% |
| FY2026E | $3,885M | +3.3% |

Low single-digit growth. Driven by NAC increases (pricing) more than volume. Sustainable but not exciting.

### FCF Trend (CONCERN)
| Year | FCF | Margin |
|------|-----|--------|
| FY2022 | $747M | 21.6% |
| FY2023 | $752M | 21.7% |
| FY2024 | $657M | 18.2% |
| FY2025 | $599M | 15.9% |

**FCF declining despite revenue growth.** Driven by higher compensation, marketing, consulting, technology, and legal costs. This is the biggest fundamental concern. If FCF continues to erode, the value thesis weakens significantly.

### Capital Allocation (Excellent)
- 43% of shares retired since 2016 ($4.5B+ returned)
- 8 consecutive dividend increases (latest +12%)
- Payout ratio ~35% - well covered
- Aggressive buybacks at $61 avg in FY2025 (overpaid vs current $39 price)
- $1.1B remaining on $1.5B buyback authorization

**Concern**: Management bought back $400M at $61/share, now stock at $39. Capital allocation discipline questionable.

### Balance Sheet (WEAK)
- Net debt: $1.87B (3.1x EBITDA at FY2025 levels, ~2x at FY2026 guidance)
- Book value: NEGATIVE (-$4.36/share)
- Debt increased from $1.14B to $2.25B recently
- However: predictable cash flows can service this debt

**Negative book value means all equity value comes from earnings power, not assets.** This is common for capital-light businesses with heavy buybacks but increases risk if earnings deteriorate.

## Valuation

### DCF (tools/dcf_calculator.py)
Assumptions: 4% growth, 2% terminal, 10% WACC (conservative given debt levels)

| Scenario | Fair Value | MoS at $39 |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| Bear | $38.89 | ~0% |
| Base | $50.91 | +30% |
| Bull | $67.04 | +72% |

### Earnings-Based
- FY2026 EPS guide: $4.85-5.00
- At 10x earnings (conservative for stable business): $48.50-50.00
- At 12x earnings (market could re-rate): $58.20-60.00
- At 8x earnings (current, assumes permanent headwinds): $38.80-40.00

### Comparables
- Intuit (INTU): P/E ~30x (much higher growth, dominant DIY position)
- Jackson Hewitt: Private
- Tax industry average: 12-15x
- HRB at 8.9x is well below industry. Discount partially justified by lower growth and debt.

### Fair Value Estimate
**Conservative range: $45-55/share**
**Central estimate: $50 (28% upside)**

## Key Risks

1. **AI disruption (MEDIUM-HIGH, 3-5yr)** - Tax prep is rules-based and highly automatable. AI agents could handle increasingly complex returns. HRB's partnership with OpenAI is defensive but may not be enough. Counter: complex tax situations (businesses, investments, multi-state) still need human judgment. Timeline: gradual erosion, not cliff.

2. **IRS Direct File (MEDIUM, 2-5yr)** - Free government option now permanent. 90% satisfaction. Currently simple returns only, but scope could expand. Counter: only affects simplest returns that HRB doesn't prioritize anyway.

3. **Negative book value / high leverage (MEDIUM)** - $1.87B net debt on $5B market cap. If earnings decline, debt servicing becomes challenging. Net debt = 37% of market cap. However, 2x EBITDA is manageable.

4. **CEO transition (LOW-MEDIUM)** - Jones retiring Dec 2025. New CEO could change strategy. Uncertainty typically resolves in 6-12 months.

5. **FCF erosion (MEDIUM-HIGH)** - FCF declining from $752M to $599M over 3 years. If this trend continues, the value case collapses. Must monitor cost growth vs revenue growth.

6. **Buyback timing (LOW)** - Management bought back $400M at $61 average. Now at $39. Destroyed significant shareholder value. Current price is better for buybacks but trust in capital allocation is reduced.

7. **Seasonal business concentration (LOW)** - 60% revenue in one quarter. Operational risk if anything disrupts tax season (unlikely but possible).

## Quality Score: 4/10 (Tier B/C)

1. ROE >15% consistently? - YES (but negative equity distorts this)
2. FCF positive 5+ years? - YES
3. Debt/Equity <1.0? - NO (negative equity, high debt)
4. Dividend 10+ years without cut? - YES (8 consecutive increases)
5. Wide moat? - NO (narrow, weakening)
6. Revenue stability? - YES (tax prep is recurring/necessary)
7. Management quality? - MIXED (overpaid for buybacks, CEO leaving)
8. Analyst coverage >10? - NO (only ~2 analysts)
9. Market cap >10B? - NO ($5B)
10. Defensive sector? - PARTIAL (necessary service but discretionary how you file)

**Score: 4-5/10 = Tier B-C. Apply 25-35% MoS requirement.**

## Investment Decision

### Bull Case ($55-67)
- FCF stabilizes at $500-600M on cost discipline
- New CEO brings fresh strategy, market re-rates
- Share count drops to ~115M by FY2028, EPS grows to $5.50+
- AI partnership with OpenAI becomes differentiator
- P/E re-rates to 11-12x

### Bear Case ($30-38)
- FCF continues declining toward $400M
- AI/IRS Direct File accelerate client losses
- Debt becomes burden if earnings drop
- P/E compresses to 6-7x on secular decline narrative

### Base Case ($48-52)
- Revenue grows 3-4%, FCF stabilizes at $500M
- Share count declines 4-5%/yr, EPS grows 7-8%/yr
- Market re-rates modestly to 10x forward earnings
- Dividend yield of 4.3% provides floor

### Decision: CONDITIONAL BUY

**MoS at base case: ~30% (meets 25% Tier B threshold)**

Conditions:
- Position size: MAX 3% (elevated risk profile: debt, FCF erosion, moat weakening)
- At EUR 400 target = ~$474 = ~12 shares at $39
- Monitor: Q2 FY2026 results (Feb/Mar 2026) for FCF trajectory
- Stop-loss mental: if FCF drops below $450M or new CEO signals strategy change that weakens value thesis
- Review trigger: Q3 FY2026 (the big quarter, Apr-Jun 2026)
