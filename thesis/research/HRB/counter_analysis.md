# Counter-Analysis: HRB (H&R Block)

## Fecha: 2026-02-09

---

## Executive Counter-Thesis

H&R Block is a value trap masquerading as a value investment. The stock has declined 49% from its 52-week high of $64.62 to $32.88, and the thesis claims $59.58 fair value (82% upside). This counter-analysis finds the thesis materially overstates fair value through an inappropriately low WACC (8.5% for a company with negative equity, structural disruption risk, and $2B+ debt), ignores the most dangerous competitive development in the company's history (Intuit's 600-location physical expansion directly attacking HRB's primary moat), and presents the FCF decline as "temporary" when the evidence suggests it is structural. Management has destroyed shareholder value through poorly-timed buybacks ($400M at $61, now at $33), and the new CEO, while competent, inherits a business facing the most threatening competitive environment in its 70-year history.

The thesis was written under Framework v2.0 (Feb 2026), making it the oldest and least rigorous active thesis in the portfolio. It uses an old 10-point Quality Score (not the current 100-point system), lacks an independent moat assessment, risk assessment, valuation report, or counter-analysis. The ADD decision was made without the adversarial 4-round pipeline now considered mandatory. The position is underwater ($679.80 invested, ~$625 current value, -8%).

Most critically, the thesis claims the physical network of 10,000 offices is "unreplicable" -- yet Intuit launched 600 Expert Office locations + 20 TurboTax Stores in January 2026, combining AI + human expertise in a direct assault on HRB's core assisted segment. This was not mentioned in the thesis because it had not yet happened. It is a material change that potentially invalidates the moat assessment.

## Claim-by-Claim Destruction

### Claim 1: "HRB is #2 in a US tax prep duopoly, undervalued at P/E 7.7x"

**Disconfirming Evidence:**
- Being #2 in a duopoly is only valuable if #2's position is defensible. Goldman Sachs rates HRB SELL with $48 target (now reduced from $54), citing "continued volume market share losses" and "secular reversion in mix shift from assisted to DIY."
- P/E 7.7x is not cheap if the earnings are in structural decline. The stock was at P/E ~12x at $64 -- the market has repriced it lower because it sees structural problems.
- Intuit has $100M OpenAI partnership AND is expanding physically with 600 Expert Offices + 20 TurboTax Stores (Jan 2026). This is NOT a software company staying in software -- this is a $200B company directly invading HRB's physical territory with vastly superior technology and deeper pockets.
- The "duopoly" narrative ignores that Intuit's share is growing while HRB's is stable at best, declining at worst.

**Severity: HIGH**

**Counter-argument:** A P/E of 7.7x for a business whose primary moat (physical network) is now being directly attacked by a competitor with 50x the market cap, superior AI, and physical expansion is not cheap -- it reflects warranted skepticism about the sustainability of HRB's earnings.

---

### Claim 2: "FCF decline is temporary, will stabilize"

**Disconfirming Evidence:**
- FCF trajectory: $747M (FY22) -> $752M (FY23) -> $657M (FY24) -> $599M (FY25) -> TTM $579M
- That is a 23% decline over 3 years DESPITE revenue growing from $3.46B to $3.76B (+8.6%)
- Operating expenses grew $128M (+4.6%) in FY2025, driven by higher compensation, marketing, consulting, technology, and legal costs
- The thesis assigns 40% probability to FCF continuing to decline. This is the highest P(wrong) for any assumption -- and it is the most important one
- Morningstar flagged FCF conversion declining from 96% in 2021 to 56% in 2022, and it has not recovered
- The FTC settlement ($7M + operational changes) adds costs and constrains HRB's ability to upsell customers
- DOGE cuts to IRS create a "bumpy filing season" but also reduce audit risk that drives some customers to professional preparers

**Severity: HIGH**

**Counter-argument:** The thesis calls FCF decline "temporary" driven by "one-time investments (tech, marketing)." But tech and marketing spend are PERMANENT features of competing against an AI-armed Intuit. The company must spend more just to defend its position. This is structural margin compression, not a one-time investment. FCF has declined for 3 consecutive years -- at what point does "temporary" become "permanent"?

---

### Claim 3: "AI disruption is gradual (3-5 years), not immediate"

**Disconfirming Evidence:**
- Intuit has embedded "Intuit Assist" across ALL products (TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, Mailchimp). This is not a future threat -- it is deployed NOW in 2026 tax season.
- Intuit Assist: interprets documents via photo upload, auto-classifies expenses, identifies missed credits (QBI deduction), and reduces live support contacts by 11%. These are capabilities that directly substitute for HRB's assisted services.
- Intuit has a $100 million partnership with OpenAI to integrate financial products directly into ChatGPT. When 500M+ ChatGPT users can get tax advice and file through Intuit, HRB's brand advantage evaporates.
- AI has already saved Intuit $90M in the first half of the fiscal year. This is REAL cost advantage being deployed against HRB.
- TurboTax has opened 600 Expert Offices + 20 flagship stores (Jan 2026) combining AI + human expertise -- this is HRB's exact value proposition but with better technology.
- While ChatGPT cannot submit tax returns directly to the IRS, Intuit is building the bridge between AI advice and filing. HRB's AI efforts are defensive and behind.
- The Washington Post documented that BOTH TurboTax and H&R Block's AI chatbots gave bad tax advice in 2024 -- but Intuit has iterated much faster and invested much more.

**Severity: HIGH**

**Counter-argument:** The thesis says "3-5 year timeline." But Intuit is not waiting 3-5 years. Intuit Assist is live. 600 physical locations are open. The $100M OpenAI deal is signed. HRB's "partnership with OpenAI" is defensive and reactive -- Intuit is proactive and has a $100M head start. The disruption is not "3-5 years away" -- it is happening NOW, and HRB is losing the arms race.

---

### Claim 4: "IRS Direct File only for simple returns"

**Disconfirming Evidence:**
- IRS Direct File has been DISCONTINUED for the 2026 tax season. The program was ended by the current administration.
- This is actually FAVORABLE for HRB, removing one threat vector.
- However, the thesis scored IRS Direct File risk as "25% probability, HIGH impact" -- with the program now dead, this overstated the threat.

**Severity: LOW (thesis was WRONG but in the WRONG direction -- the risk was overestimated)**

**Counter-argument:** The thesis was too bearish on IRS Direct File. With the program ended, this is a positive for HRB. However, this removed threat does NOT offset the INCREASED threat from Intuit's physical expansion, which was not in the thesis at all.

---

### Claim 5: "Buybacks create value through share count decline"

**Disconfirming Evidence:**
- FY2025: Repurchased 6.5M shares at $61.10 average ($400M). Stock now at $32.88. Value destroyed: ~$183M (46% of capital deployed was wasted).
  - Q1 FY2025: 3.3M shares at $63.51 average
  - Q2 FY2025: 3.2M shares at ~$59.50 average
- FY2024: Repurchased 8.0M shares at $43.66 average ($350M). Stock now at $32.88. Value destroyed: ~$86M.
- Q1 FY2026: Repurchased 7.9M shares at $50.90 average ($400M). Stock now at $32.88. Value destroyed: ~$142M.
- **TOTAL estimated buyback value destruction (FY24-Q1 FY26): ~$411M** -- this is nearly a full year of FCF burned by buying shares above intrinsic value.
- Since 2016, the company has spent $4.5B+ on buybacks. The stock price is now at the same level it was in 2016. The share count reduction is real (~43%), but the returns to shareholders have been poor because management systematically overpaid.
- The thesis itself acknowledges this: "Management bought back $400M at $61, now at $39 -- capital allocation error." Yet it still rates capital allocation as "Excellent."

**Severity: HIGH**

**Counter-argument:** Buybacks ONLY create value when purchased below intrinsic value. Management spent ~$1.15B in FY24-Q1 FY26 at average prices of $43-63, while the stock sits at $33. This is textbook value destruction. It also increased debt from $1.14B to $2.25B to fund these buybacks. The company leveraged its balance sheet to buy expensive stock. If management's judgment on when to buy back stock was THIS wrong, why should we trust their judgment on the business?

---

### Claim 6: "FV = $59.58 (82% upside from current $32.88)"

**Disconfirming Evidence:**
- WACC of 8.5% is too low. The thesis derives 6.5% base WACC, then adds 2% "risk premium" for AI/structural risk. But:
  - Negative equity means cost of equity calculation is unreliable (beta on negative equity is meaningless)
  - Company has $2.25B total debt with $1.87B net debt. ND/EBITDA ~2x is manageable but 37% of market cap.
  - Structural disruption (Intuit physical expansion, AI) warrants higher risk premium than 2%
  - 10% WACC (original thesis v1) was more appropriate than 8.5% (v2.0)
  - At 10% WACC: DCF base = $50.91 (v1 estimate), not $62.83
- EV/EBIT multiple of 9.5x assumes re-rating from current 6.9x. But:
  - Goldman Sachs rates SELL with $48 target (implying ~7-8x multiple is fair)
  - Market is specifically NOT re-rating HRB because it sees structural issues
  - If the market is right that HRB faces structural headwinds, the current 6.9x multiple may be CORRECT, not cheap
- The thesis weights Bear at only 25%. Given the evidence of structural decline, a more honest weighting might be 35-40% Bear, 40% Base, 20-25% Bull
- Using v1 estimates ($51 base) with adjusted probability: Expected FV = ($38.89 x 0.35) + ($51 x 0.40) + ($67 x 0.25) = $13.61 + $20.40 + $16.75 = $50.76
- Even this may be generous given Intuit's new physical expansion

**Severity: HIGH**

**Counter-argument:** The FV upgrade from $51 (v1) to $59.58 (v2) was driven primarily by reducing WACC from 10% to 8.5%. This 1.5pp reduction was the thesis author's largest assumption change, and it went in the WRONG direction for a company facing increasing competitive threats, FCF erosion, and balance sheet leverage. A more honest FV range is $38-50 base case, with the bear case ($30-38) increasingly plausible.

## Special Focus Areas

### 1. FCF Structural Decline

**Data:**
| Year | Revenue | RevGrowth | FCF | FCFMargin | Delta |
|------|---------|-----------|-----|-----------|-------|
| FY2022 | $3,463M | - | $747M | 21.6% | - |
| FY2023 | $3,472M | +0.3% | $752M | 21.7% | +$5M |
| FY2024 | $3,610M | +4.0% | $657M | 18.2% | -$95M |
| FY2025 | $3,761M | +4.2% | $599M | 15.9% | -$58M |
| TTM | ~$3,800M | ~+1% | ~$579M | ~15.2% | -$20M |

**Key observations:**
- Revenue grew +8.6% from FY22 to FY25. FCF DECLINED 20%.
- FCF margin compressed from 21.7% to 15.9% -- a 580bps decline in 3 years.
- Operating expenses grew $128M (+4.6%) in FY2025 alone: higher compensation, marketing, consulting, technology, and legal costs.
- These are NOT one-time costs. They are ongoing competitive necessities: marketing to retain clients against TurboTax, technology to counter AI disruption, legal costs from FTC settlement.
- FCF conversion (FCF/EBITDA) has declined from ~77% (FY22) to ~61% (FY25).

**Structural argument:** HRB must spend more to defend its position against a vastly better-funded competitor (Intuit: $180B market cap vs HRB: $4.2B). This spending is permanent and likely to increase. The thesis assumption that "FCF can stabilize with cost discipline" ignores that cutting costs (closing offices, reducing marketing) would accelerate client losses.

**Counter-thesis verdict:** FCF stabilization requires EITHER (a) cost cuts that risk client losses, OR (b) revenue acceleration that is not materializing. Neither path is clear. The thesis's "40% probability FCF continues declining" should be higher -- perhaps 55-60%.

### 2. Buyback Value Destruction

**Calculation of value destroyed:**

| Period | Shares Bought | Avg Price | Total Spent | Current Value | Value Destroyed |
|--------|---------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| FY2024 | 8.0M | $43.66 | $350M | $263M | -$87M (-25%) |
| FY2025 | 6.5M | $61.10 | $400M | $214M | -$186M (-47%) |
| Q1 FY2026 | 7.9M | $50.90 | $400M | $260M | -$140M (-35%) |
| **Total** | **22.4M** | **$51.34** | **$1,150M** | **$737M** | **-$413M (-36%)** |

**$413 million of shareholder value destroyed in 2 years.**

For context:
- $413M is 70% of FY2025 FCF ($599M)
- $413M is nearly 10% of current market cap ($4.2B)
- The company took on ~$1.1B in additional debt partially to fund these buybacks
- If instead of buying back at $51, they had waited and bought at $33, they could have retired 34.8M shares instead of 22.4M -- 55% more shares retired

**Management's track record:** The thesis rates capital allocation as "Excellent" in the research note, but acknowledges the buyback timing was an "error" in the autocritica section. This is contradictory. Capital allocation cannot be "excellent" when management destroyed $413M buying high and leveraging the balance sheet to do so.

**Is management incentivized correctly?** CEO Curtis Campbell (started Jan 2026) has a $995K base salary, 125% STI target, and $6M LTI. The LTI presumably ties to stock performance, which aligns interests. However, he has no established track record at HRB, and his prior roles include TaxAct (a competitor HRB is beating), Capital One, and Intuit. The insider ownership data is not available in public sources.

### 3. AI Disruption Reality Check

**The thesis assumes AI disruption is "gradual, 3-5 years." Here is what is happening NOW (Feb 2026):**

**Intuit's AI arsenal (deployed today):**
- Intuit Assist: generative AI embedded in TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, Mailchimp
- Photo upload document interpretation with auto-classification
- Automated deduction detection (e.g., QBI deduction)
- Reduces live support contacts by 11% (cost advantage)
- $90M savings in first half of fiscal year from AI
- $100M partnership with OpenAI to integrate into ChatGPT
- GenOS: Intuit's proprietary AI platform purpose-built for financial data

**Intuit's physical expansion (NEW -- not in thesis):**
- 600 Expert Office locations nationwide (launched Jan 2026)
- 20 TurboTax flagship stores (NYC SoHo, Southern California, Chicago, Dallas, Phoenix)
- Combining AI + human expertise at physical locations
- This directly attacks HRB's #1 moat: physical network

**HRB's AI response:**
- AI chatbot for 24/7 tax questions
- Partnership with OpenAI (defensive, no disclosed investment amount)
- But: Washington Post documented HRB's AI chatbot gave bad tax advice in 2024

**The asymmetry:**
- Intuit: $180B market cap, $100M OpenAI deal, proprietary GenOS, 600+ physical locations, R&D budget multiples of HRB
- HRB: $4.2B market cap, undisclosed OpenAI "partnership," defensive posture, FTC settlement constraining customer practices

**Timeline assessment:** The thesis says "3-5 years." I assess the disruption is happening on a 1-3 year timeframe for simple-to-moderate complexity returns. Complex returns (businesses, multi-state, investments) remain defensible for 5+ years, but this is a SHRINKING segment of HRB's revenue as AI capabilities expand each year.

---

### 4. IRS Direct File Expansion

**Status: DISCONTINUED.** The IRS announced that Direct File will NOT be available for the 2026 filing season. The Trump administration and DOGE cuts have effectively killed this program.

**Impact on thesis:** This is genuinely positive for HRB. One material threat has been removed. However:
- The program served only 296,531 returns in 2025 (<0.5% of all returns) -- it was never a material near-term threat
- The thesis allocated 25% probability and HIGH impact to this risk, which was overstated
- The removal of Direct File does NOT offset the ADDITION of Intuit's physical expansion, which the thesis does not account for at all

**Net assessment:** Neutral to slightly positive. But the market has not rewarded HRB for Direct File's discontinuation, suggesting the market was not pricing in significant Direct File risk to begin with.

---

## Value Trap Assessment

### Classic Value Trap Indicators

| Indicator | HRB Status | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| Cheap getting cheaper | YES: $64 -> $47 -> $41 -> $33 over 6 months | CRITICAL |
| Revenue growing but margins compressing | YES: Rev +8.6%, FCF -20% over 3 years | HIGH |
| Management buying back at highs | YES: $400M at $61 avg, stock now $33 | HIGH |
| Industry in secular decline | PARTIAL: assisted declining, DIY growing but commoditized | MODERATE |
| Stronger competitor on offense | YES: Intuit 600+ locations + AI + $100M OpenAI | HIGH |
| Negative book value | YES: -$4.36/share | MODERATE |
| Debt increasing while business softening | YES: Debt $1.14B -> $2.25B | HIGH |
| Low analyst coverage | YES: ~2 analysts | MODERATE |
| FTC regulatory action | YES: $7M fine + operational constraints | MODERATE |
| Stock at same price as 10 years ago | YES: ~$33 range | HIGH |

**Value Trap Score: 7-8 indicators flagged out of 10.**

The thesis's value trap checklist scored only "2-3 PARTIAL" factors. This dramatically understated the value trap risk by not counting indicators that were "partial" or by framing structural issues as temporary.

### The "Cheap for a Reason" Problem

The market is not stupid. When a stock trades at 7.7x earnings and 49% below its 52-week high, there are REASONS. The thesis argues the market is wrong. The evidence suggests the market may be right:

1. **Goldman Sachs SELL rating** -- the only major sell-side coverage is bearish
2. **Institutional investors have sold down** -- the stock decline was not caused by a single event but sustained selling over months
3. **The thesis's own FV has been wrong** -- the stock was at $38 when the thesis said FV was $59. It has gone to $33, not $59.
4. **Every comparable is declining** -- TaxAct was acquired at a declining valuation, Jackson Hewitt went private, the entire assisted tax prep model is under pressure

## Counter-Thesis Score

| Dimension | Score (0-3) | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 1. Business Quality Overstated | 2 | Thesis uses old 10-point QS (5/10 -> "Tier B"). Modern 100-point QS would likely score 45-55 (Tier C at best). Negative equity, FCF erosion, narrow weakening moat |
| 2. Moat Erosion Understated | 3 | Thesis says physical network is "unreplicable." Intuit just replicated it with 600+ locations + superior AI. This is the most critical miss |
| 3. Financial Risk Understated | 2 | Debt doubled to $2.25B, FCF declining, negative equity. 2x EBITDA manageable but 37% of shrinking market cap |
| 4. Valuation Assumptions Flawed | 2 | WACC reduced from 10% to 8.5% when risk INCREASED. Bear case probability understated. FV likely $38-50, not $59.58 |
| 5. Management Quality Overstated | 2 | Called capital allocation "Excellent" while documenting $413M in buyback value destruction. New CEO unproven at HRB |
| 6. Competitive Position Deteriorating | 3 | Intuit's $100M OpenAI deal + 600 physical locations + GenOS = existential competitive escalation. Thesis completely missed this |
| 7. Regulatory/Disruption Risk Understated | 1 | IRS Direct File discontinued (positive). FTC settlement modest. AI risk correctly identified but timeline too generous |
| 8. Capital Allocation Destroying Value | 3 | $413M destroyed in buybacks above intrinsic value. Debt increased to fund these purchases. Pro-cyclical capital allocation |

**TOTAL: 18/24 -- STRONG COUNTER**

---

## Kill Conditions Check

| Kill Condition | Status | Risk |
|----------------|--------|------|
| FCF drops below $400M | TTM ~$579M. Trend: $752->$657->$599->$579. At current decline rate, could breach in FY2027-2028 | MODERATE (2-3 year timeline) |
| Dividend cut | Current yield 5.1%, payout ~35%. Safe for now but FCF erosion could pressure by FY2028 | LOW |
| ROIC < WACC for 2+ years | ROIC ~32-35% (distorted by negative equity). True return on tangible capital is much lower. Not triggered | LOW |
| New CEO abandons core tax prep | Campbell is from TaxAct/Intuit -- tax prep is his DNA. Low risk | LOW |
| IRS Direct File expands to complex returns | Program discontinued. Zero risk for foreseeable future | ZERO |

**Assessment:** No kill conditions are immediately triggered. However, the FCF kill condition ($400M) may be reached within 2-3 years if the current decline trajectory continues. The thesis's bear case ($30-38) assumed FCF declining to $400M, and the stock is already at $32.88 -- which means the PRICE has reached bear case territory while FCF has not yet hit the kill condition.

**New kill condition I would add:** Intuit's physical locations achieve >3% share of assisted tax prep market within 2 years. This would confirm the moat is breached.

## Conflictos con Otros Analisis

No independent moat_assessment.md, risk_assessment.md, or valuation_report.md exist for HRB. This is itself a significant finding: every other position went through more rigorous analysis than HRB. The thesis was written under Framework v2.0 (8 gates, not 10), without the adversarial 4-round pipeline, and with the old Quality Score system.

The committee decision (2026-02-04) approved the ADD based on Framework v2.1 (8 gates). The current framework (v4.0) requires 10 gates including Gate 10: Counter-Analysis Gate. HRB has never been through this gate.

## Veredicto Global

| Metric | Valor |
|--------|-------|
| Desafios HIGH/CRITICAL | 10 de 19 total (53%) |
| Desafios no resueltos por thesis | 13 de 19 (thesis did not address Intuit physical expansion, buyback value destruction quantum, WACC critique, value trap score discrepancy) |
| Veredicto | **STRONG COUNTER** |

### Interpretacion:

**STRONG COUNTER:** The thesis has serious problems. Multiple HIGH and CRITICAL challenges remain unresolved. The fair value is likely materially overstated. The competitive landscape has changed materially since the thesis was written. The position should be reconsidered before any further capital is deployed.

## Recomendacion al Investment Committee

1. **DO NOT ADD** to HRB position. The thesis is the weakest in the portfolio by analytical rigor (v2.0 framework, no independent agent analysis, no counter-analysis until now).

2. **Recalculate FV** using WACC of 10% (original v1 assumption, which was more appropriate for a company with negative equity and structural disruption). This yields Base FV ~$50, not $59.58.

3. **Re-assess moat** given Intuit's 600+ physical locations launched in January 2026. The thesis's claim that "physical network is unreplicable" is now empirically false.

4. **Evaluate EXIT** using the exit protocol. Key considerations:
   - Position is -8% (small loss)
   - Opportunity cost: capital could be deployed in Tier A positions
   - Opportunity Score vs Tier A alternatives is very high (QS 45-55 / QS 79-82 * MoS 0% / MoS 29-38% = rotation clearly justified)
   - The position was sized at 5.7% (decisions_log), which is large for what is likely a Tier C company under the current 100-point QS framework

5. **If HOLD**, reduce position to 2-3% max and update kill conditions to include:
   - Intuit achieves >3% share of assisted tax prep within 2 years
   - FCF drops below $500M (tighter than current $400M threshold)
   - Q3 FY2026 (Apr-Jun 2026) assisted volume declines YoY

6. **Strong preference for SELL** based on Principle 9 (Quality Gravitation): every euro in HRB is a euro not in a Tier A compounder. The position was accumulated at avg $35.78; the current price is $32.88 (-8%). Taking the loss now and redeploying into existing Tier A positions is likely the highest expected return use of this capital.

## META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres
- I could not find specific insider ownership percentages for HRB management. If management owns significant stock, their alignment improves the bull case.
- The DOGE IRS cuts could be a double-edged sword: fewer audits means less fear-driven demand for professional tax prep, but also a more confusing filing season that drives people to seek help. Net effect unclear.
- Wave (small business segment) showed "double-digit growth" and "continued double-digit Wave growth" in Q2 FY2026. If this segment scales, it could partially offset assisted decline. I could not find specific revenue figures for Wave.
- The FY2026 guidance of $4.85-$5.00 EPS implies EBITDA $1.015-$1.035B, which is actually UP from FY2025 EBITDA of $976M. If guidance is hit, FCF might indeed stabilize. But guidance was "reaffirmed" not raised, and management credibility on FCF is low.

### Limitaciones de Este Analisis
- I could not access HRB's full 10-K filing to get exact debt maturity schedule, detailed capex breakdown, or segment-level profitability
- I could not find comprehensive data on HRB's total client count or volume trends over 5 years (only directional commentary)
- I could not run the quality_scorer.py tool on HRB during this analysis to get the modern 100-point QS
- The buyback value destruction calculation uses current price ($32.88) which is a point-in-time snapshot; if the stock recovers, the calculation changes

### Sugerencias para el Sistema
- HRB thesis should be upgraded to Framework v4.0 with full 4-round adversarial pipeline if the position is to be maintained
- All active positions should have their thesis dated and framework version tracked. Positions with pre-v4.0 theses should be prioritized for adversarial review.
- The decisions_log.yaml entry for HRB ADD (2026-02-05) assigned conviction "Media-Alta." After this counter-analysis, conviction should be downgraded to LOW.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator
1. Should HRB go through a full re-evaluation (review-agent) given that the thesis was written under Framework v2.0 and does not account for Intuit's physical expansion?
2. Is the opportunity cost of holding HRB at 5.7% of portfolio quantifiable vs deploying that capital in existing Tier A positions?
3. Should the modern quality_scorer.py be run on HRB to get the official 100-point QS and confirm the appropriate tier?
4. Given that 8/9 positions reviewed in the adversarial review (Sessions 50-51) had inflated FV (avg -15%), and HRB's thesis is OLDER and less rigorous than those, is it likely that HRB's FV inflation is even worse than average?
