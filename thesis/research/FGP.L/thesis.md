# FirstGroup plc (FGP.L) - Fundamental Thesis v2.0

**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Version:** 2.0 (Framework v2.0 compliant)
**Analyst:** Fundamental Analyst Agent
**Status:** RESEARCH - WATCHLIST with STANDING ORDER
**Tier:** B (Cyclical of Quality) - MoS required >=25%

---

## Executive Summary

FirstGroup is a UK-based transport operator running bus services (First Bus UK, First Bus London) and rail services (open access via Lumo/Hull Trains). After divesting US operations (Greyhound, First Student/Transit) in 2021-2022, it is now a pure-play UK transport company in transition: growing bus operations while DfT rail contracts wind down to nationalisation.

The stock trades at 188.8p (P/E ~9x FY2026E), with 4 analysts covering (all Buy, avg target ~250p). The 41.8% FCF yield from screening is **an IFRS 16 distortion** -- true normalized FCF yield is closer to 10-13%. Still attractive for a transport operator, but not the screaming bargain it initially appears.

**Verdict: Attractive at ~165p or below (MoS ~25% on conservative 220p fair value). Current price of 188.8p offers ~14-17% MoS -- insufficient for Tier B. MAINTAIN STANDING ORDER at 165p.**

## BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING (Framework v2.0 Section 1)

### 1.1 What Problem FirstGroup Solves

**Core value proposition:** Mass transportation of passengers in the UK via bus and rail.

- **Bus (Regional):** Essential transport for commuters, students, elderly without cars in regional UK cities (Bristol, Leeds, Glasgow, Manchester). "Must-have" for many customers without alternatives.
- **Bus (London):** TfL-contracted service covering ~12% of London bus routes. Essential public service.
- **Open Access Rail:** Budget long-distance rail competing with LNER/Avanti on price. "Nice-to-have" alternative to more expensive franchised operators.

### 1.2 How FirstGroup Generates Revenue

| Segment | Model | Revenue Type | % of Adj Rev |
|---------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| First Bus Regional | Fare revenue + local authority contracts | Mostly transaction-based, some contracted | ~55% |
| First Bus London | TfL cost-plus contracts | Contracted, fee-based | ~20% |
| Open Access Rail (Lumo, Hull Trains) | Fare revenue | Transaction-based | ~8% |
| Rail Services | Consulting, depot maintenance | Fee-for-service | ~7% |
| DfT TOCs (declining) | National Rail Contracts | Management fee | ~10% declining |

**Recurring vs one-time:** ~70% is effectively recurring (contracted services, repeat commuters). ~30% discretionary travel (leisure, coach).

### 1.3 Unit Economics

**Bus Operations (core business):**
```
Revenue per passenger-km: ~10-12p (regulated/capped)
Cost per passenger-km: ~8-10p (fuel, driver wages, fleet depreciation)
Operating margin: 6-10% depending on region

Customer acquisition: Near-zero CAC -- customers come to bus stops
Lifetime value: £200-500/year for regular commuter x 3-5 year average tenure
LTV/CAC: Very high (>10x) but low absolute margin

Payback period: Immediate (no CAC)
```

**Open Access Rail:**
```
Revenue per journey (avg): £30-40 (Lumo), £25-35 (Hull Trains)
Operating margin: 10-15% (higher than bus due to scale on ECML)
Capacity utilization: 70-80% on Lumo (very good for budget rail)
```

**Key insight:** Bus is a low-margin, high-volume business with minimal customer acquisition costs but heavy asset requirements (fleet, depots). Open access rail has better unit economics but higher regulatory barriers.

### 1.4 Margin Structure

```
Gross Margin: N/A (service business, use operating margin)
Operating Margin (adj):
  - Group: 6.6% FY2025, 7.5%+ target
  - First Bus Regional: 8.2% (H1 2026)
  - First Bus London: 2-3% (TfL contracts are thin margin)
  - Open Access: 10-15%
  - DfT TOCs: ~2-3% (management fee)

Trend: Improving. FY2024 was ~5.5%, FY2025 ~6.6%, FY2026E targeting 7%+.
vs Peers: In line. Mobico (National Express) similar 6-8% range.

Net Margin: ~4-5% after interest/tax
FCF Margin (normalized): ~8-10% of adj revenue
```

### 1.5 Capital Requirements

**Type: Asset-Medium/Heavy**
- Fleet: ~4,700 buses (depreciating assets, ~8-12 year life)
- Depots: Leased primarily (IFRS16 impact)
- Rolling stock (rail): Leased from ROSCOs (Eversholt, Angel, etc.)

```
Capex (FY2025): £156m (~10% of adj revenue)
  - Maintenance capex: ~£80m (fleet replacement)
  - Growth capex: ~£76m (new buses, zero-emission fleet)

Working capital: Slightly negative (advance ticket sales) - source of cash
IFRS16 lease payments: ~£467m annually (THIS IS THE BIG NUMBER)
```

**Critical insight:** The business looks more capital-light than it is because IFRS16 moves lease costs from OpEx to financing. True cash required to run the business is ~£500-600m/year when including leases.

## POR QUE ESTA BARATA (Framework v2.0 Section 2)

### 2.1 Narrativa del Mercado

The market believes:
- [x] **Sector out-of-favor:** UK transport is unloved, especially after COVID
- [x] **Regulatory risk:** Labour government nationalising rail, potential further bus regulation
- [x] **Margenes bajo presion:** Rising wages (NI increase), fuel costs, £3 fare cap limits pricing power
- [x] **Balance deteriorandose:** Rising adjusted net debt (£87m -> £208m H1 2026)
- [ ] Declive secular: NO - passenger numbers recovering
- [ ] Disrupcion tecnologica: NO - autonomous vehicles very distant threat
- [ ] Management issues: NO - capital allocation has been good
- [ ] Loss of market share: NO - gaining share via acquisitions

### 2.2 Mi Contra-Tesis

| Mercado cree | Yo creo | Mi evidencia | Prob. equivocado |
|--------------|---------|--------------|------------------|
| Rail nationalisation kills the business | Bus is now 75%+ of value; rail DfT was low-margin anyway; open access NOT nationalised | DfT TOC contribution ~£40m declining to £0 by 2027 vs bus £96m+ and growing | 20% |
| Cost inflation will crush margins | Restructuring savings £15m + fare increase £2->£3 + operational efficiencies offset NI increase | H1 2026 margin held at 6.1% despite 1.4pp NI headwind | 30% |
| Rising debt is a red flag | Debt increase is growth investment (RATP acquisition); FY2026E guidance £125-135m is reasonable | FCF generation covers debt service comfortably at 3x coverage | 25% |
| P/E of 9x reflects fair value | 9x is trough valuation for a growing bus operator with open access optionality | Historically 9-14x mid-cycle; peers Mobico at 12-14x | 25% |

### 2.3 Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | Status | Comentario |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Industria en declive secular | NO | UK bus passenger numbers +2% organic; open access rail growing 7%+ |
| Disrupcion tecnologica inminente | NO | Autonomous vehicles >10 years away for mass transit |
| Management destruyendo valor | NO | Strong capital allocation track record (US divestment, buybacks) |
| Balance deteriorandose | WATCH | H1 2026 net debt rose but guidance is £125-135m FY2026E |
| Insider selling masivo | NO | No significant insider selling; share buybacks ongoing |
| Dividend cut reciente o probable | NO | Dividend restored 2023, growing progressively (3.8p->5.0p->6.5p) |
| Perdida market share >2pp | NO | Gaining share via acquisitions (RATP London, Tootbus) |
| ROIC < WACC ultimos 3 anos | WATCH | ROIC ~8-10%, WACC ~9-10% -- marginal |
| FCF negativo >2 anos consecutivos | NO | FCF positive (normalized) every year since FY2023 |
| Goodwill >50% equity | NO | Goodwill is minimal post-US divestment |

**Value Trap Score: 2 factors (WATCH) out of 10 -- PASSES checklist (<3 SI)**

### 2.4 Mi Ventaja Informacional

- [x] **Horizonte temporal mas largo:** Market focused on rail nationalisation headwind; I see 2-3 year bus growth story
- [x] **IFRS16 distortion understood:** Many screeners show 40%+ FCF yield; I know it's really 10-13%
- [x] **Open access optionality undervalued:** Stirling/South Wales routes could add £50m revenue/£7m profit by 2029
- [ ] Entiendo el negocio mejor: Moderate - transport is not complex
- [ ] Analisis cuantitativo unico: Moderate - standard analysis

**Ventaja clara pero modesta.** Not a high-conviction edge.

## CATALIZADORES (Framework v2.0 Section 3)

| Catalizador | Timeframe | Probabilidad | Impacto |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| FY2026 results confirm EPS growth | June 2026 | Alta (80%) | +10-15% |
| Stirling open access launch | Mid-2026 | Alta (75%) | +5-10% (sentiment) |
| Further buyback announcements | H2 2026 | Media (60%) | +5% |
| Market recognizes bus growth story | 2026-2027 | Media (50%) | +20-30% re-rating |
| South Wales open access launch | Dec 2027 | Media (60%) | +10% |
| Private equity interest (takeout) | 2026-2028 | Baja (20%) | +30-50% premium |

### Que Tiene Que Pasar para que la Thesis Funcione

1. Bus margins hold at 7-8% despite cost inflation
2. Open access routes launch successfully and reach profitability within 2 years
3. No further adverse regulatory changes (fare caps tightened, etc.)
4. Adjusted net debt stays <£150m by FY2027

### Kill Conditions (vender inmediatamente si)

1. Bus operating margin falls below 5% for 2+ consecutive quarters
2. Open access routes delayed >12 months or cancelled
3. Labour government extends nationalisation to bus services
4. Dividend cut
5. Adjusted net debt >£250m with no clear path to reduction

---

## CONEXION CON CONTEXTO MACRO (Framework v2.0 Section 4)

### 4.1 Sensibilidad Macro

| Factor | Sensibilidad | Impacto actual |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Tasas de interes | Media | BoE at 3.75%; higher rates hurt via lease costs, but fleet largely hedged |
| Recesion | Media | Bus demand somewhat counter-cyclical (people trade down from car) |
| Inflacion | Alta | Wage inflation (drivers) is key cost; partially offset by fare increases |
| USD strength | Ninguna | Purely UK business post-US divestment |
| Oil/fuel prices | Media | ~15% of costs; hedged 12 months ahead typically |

### 4.2 Fit con World View Actual (2026-02-02)

From current_view.md:
- **UK economy:** Stable, 1.2% growth expected 2026. Neutral for transport demand.
- **Labour government:** Pro-public transport rhetoric, but nationalising rail (not bus). Mixed.
- **Inflation:** PCE ~3%, wage pressures. Negative for margins but £3 cap helps revenue.
- **Geopolitics:** Iran-US tension affects oil prices. Minor negative via fuel costs.

**Fit assessment: NEUTRAL to SLIGHTLY FAVORABLE**

Transport is not a geopolitically sensitive sector. UK domestic focus insulates from tariff wars. The £3 fare cap extension to March 2027 provides revenue visibility. Open access rail expansion is counter-cyclical (budget alternative to expensive rail).

---

## PROYECCION FUNDAMENTADA (Framework v2.0 Section 5)

### 5.1 TAM Analysis

```
UK Coach & Bus Transport Market: £4.2bn (2025)
  - Growth rate: Recovering from COVID. CAGR ~2-3% 2025-2030.
  - Drivers: Population growth, urbanization, sustainability push
  - Headwinds: Remote work, private car ownership

UK Open Access Rail: ~£300-400m (estimated addressable, small but growing fast)
  - Growth rate: 7-10% as new operators enter and expand
  - Drivers: Price-sensitive travelers, ECML congestion, green travel
```

### 5.2 Market Share Analysis

**Bus (ex-London):**
```
FirstGroup regional market share: ~15% (2nd largest after Stagecoach ~26%)
Trend: Stable to slightly gaining via organic growth and small acquisitions
Projection: 15-16% by 2028 (conservative)
```

**Bus (London):**
```
FirstGroup London share: ~12% (post-RATP acquisition)
Trend: Gained 5pp via acquisition
Projection: 12-13% stable (TfL contracts)
```

**Open Access Rail:**
```
Lumo: Only budget operator on ECML
Hull Trains: Established on Hull-London route
New routes: Stirling (2026), South Wales (2027), potentially Rochdale (2028)
Projection: Open access revenue doubles by 2028
```

### 5.3 Pricing Power

```
Pricing power score: WEAK to MODERATE

Bus fares: Capped at £3 nationally until March 2027. Can raise after, but political sensitivity.
Rail fares: More flexibility on open access but compete with franchised operators.
London bus: Cost-plus contracts - no pricing power, but no price risk either.

Projection: Pricing +1-2% per year after 2027 when cap potentially lifted or raised.
```

### 5.4 Revenue Projection

```
Revenue Growth = TAM Growth + Delta Market Share + Pricing + Acquisitions

Organic:
  TAM Growth: +2%
  Market Share: +0.5pp
  Pricing: +1%
  = Organic Revenue Growth: ~3.5-4%

With acquisitions (RATP London, Grand Union, Tootbus):
  FY2026 adj revenue: ~£1.6bn (+17% vs FY2025)
  FY2027E adj revenue: ~£1.7-1.8bn (+6-12% depending on rail nationalisation impact)
  FY2028E adj revenue: ~£1.8-2.0bn

Base case growth: 4-6% CAGR 2026-2030 (organic) after acquisition integration
Bear case: 2% (organic stagnant, cost pressures)
Bull case: 8% (open access expansion, M&A)
```

### 5.5 Margin Projection

```
Operating Margin:
  FY2025: 6.6%
  FY2026E: 7.0-7.5% (restructuring benefits, integration)
  FY2027E: 7.5-8.0% (DfT TOC drag removed, open access scales)
  FY2028E: 8.0-8.5% (target state)

Normalized FCF:
  FY2025: ~£130m
  FY2026E: ~£140-150m
  FY2027E: ~£150-170m
  FY2028E: ~£160-180m
```

### 5.6 WACC Derivation

```
Risk-Free Rate (UK 10Y Gilt): 4.5%
Equity Risk Premium: 5.0%
Beta: 0.72 (yfinance)
Cost of Equity (Ke) = 4.5% + 0.72 × 5.0% = 8.1%

Cost of Debt (estimated): 5.5% (based on similar UK corporates)
Tax Rate: 25%
After-tax Kd = 5.5% × (1 - 0.25) = 4.1%

Capital Structure:
  Market Cap: £1,023m (from price_checker)
  Adjusted Net Debt: £130m (FY2026E)
  EV: ~£1,153m
  E/V: 89%
  D/V: 11%

WACC = (89% × 8.1%) + (11% × 4.1%)
WACC = 7.2% + 0.5% = 7.7%

Sanity check: 7.7% seems low for a cyclical transport company.
Adjusted WACC (conservative): 9-10% to account for regulatory risk and IFRS16 uncertainty.
```

### 5.7 Terminal Growth

```
UK GDP growth: ~1.5-2.0% long-term
Transport sector: ~2% (population + urbanization)
FirstGroup terminal growth: 2.0% (in line with sector)

Justification: UK population stable, transport demand grows with economic activity.
Cannot exceed GDP growth sustainably.
```

## VALORACION MULTI-METODO (Framework v2.0 Section 6)

**Tipo de empresa:** Cíclica/Regulated Transport
**Métodos apropiados:** EV/EBIT normalizado (primary), P/E múltiples (secondary), DCF normalizado (tertiary)

### Método 1: EV/EBIT Normalizado

```
Normalized EBIT (FY2027E, post-DfT exit): ~£120-130m
  - First Bus Regional: £100m (8% margin on £1.25bn rev)
  - First Bus London: £15m (5% margin on £300m rev)
  - Open Access Rail: £15m (12% margin on £125m rev)
  - Rail Services: £10m
  - DfT TOCs: £0 (transferred)

EV/EBIT multiple for UK transport: 8-10x
  - Sector median: 8-9x (industrials/transport)
  - Adjustment for growth (open access): +1x
  - Adjustment for regulatory risk: -1x
  - Final multiple: 8-9x

EV = £125m × 8.5x = £1,063m
Equity = EV - Net Debt = £1,063m - £130m = £933m
Per share (543m shares) = 172p

Conservative EV/EBIT suggests: 172p (Bear), 195p (Base at 9x), 218p (Bull at 10x)
```

### Método 2: P/E Múltiples

```
EPS FY2026E: ~21-22p (company guiding for "modest growth" from 19.4p)
EPS FY2027E: ~24-25p (DfT drag gone, open access ramp)

UK transport historical P/E range:
  - Trough: 6-8x (crisis)
  - Mid-cycle: 9-12x
  - Peak: 13-16x

Current P/E: 9.0x (at 188.8p / 21p EPS)
This is LOW END of mid-cycle.

Fair value at mid-cycle P/E:
  Bear (8x): 8 × 21p = 168p
  Base (11x): 11 × 21p = 231p
  Bull (13x): 13 × 24p = 312p
```

### Método 3: DCF Normalizado (manual, NOT yfinance)

```
Normalized FCF: £130m (FY2025), growing 5% to FY2030, then 2% terminal
WACC: 9.5% (conservative)

Year 1: £137m → PV £125m
Year 2: £143m → PV £120m
Year 3: £151m → PV £115m
Year 4: £158m → PV £110m
Year 5: £166m → PV £105m
Terminal Value: £166m × 1.02 / (0.095 - 0.02) = £2,259m → PV £1,432m

Total PV: £575m + £1,432m = £2,007m
Less: Net debt £130m
Equity: £1,877m
Per share: 346p

Note: DCF gives highest value but is very sensitive to FCF estimate.
At FCF of £100m: 266p
At WACC 11%: 251p
```

### Reconciliación de Métodos

| Método | Bear | Base | Bull | Peso |
|--------|------|------|------|------|
| EV/EBIT (8-10x) | 172p | 195p | 218p | 40% |
| P/E (8-13x) | 168p | 231p | 312p | 40% |
| DCF (WACC 9.5-11%) | 251p | 300p | 346p | 20% |
| **Weighted** | **182p** | **224p** | **271p** | 100% |

**Divergencia:** P/E y EV/EBIT métodos dan ~195-230p. DCF da ~300p.
**Razón:** DCF assumes perpetual FCF growth which may be optimistic for a regulated business.
**Método más confiable:** EV/EBIT y P/E (sector-appropriate). DCF discounted due to IFRS16 complexity.

**Blended Fair Value: 220-230p (base), 180-190p (bear), 270-280p (bull)**

## ESCENARIOS (Framework v2.0 Section 7)

### Bear Case (25% probabilidad)

**Assumptions:**
- Bus margins compress to 5-6% (NI costs, £3 cap)
- Open access routes underperform (competition, delays)
- No re-rating (P/E stays at 8-9x)
- Revenue growth 2% CAGR

**Fair Value Bear:** 180p
**Downside from current:** -5%

### Base Case (50% probabilidad)

**Assumptions:**
- Bus margins hold 7-8%
- Open access launches on schedule, contributes £7-10m profit by 2028
- P/E re-rates to 10-11x as market recognizes growth
- Revenue growth 5% CAGR

**Fair Value Base:** 220-230p
**Upside from current:** +17-22%

### Bull Case (25% probabilidad)

**Assumptions:**
- Bus margins expand to 9%+ (restructuring, scale)
- Open access exceeds expectations (Stirling, South Wales, Rochdale all launch)
- P/E re-rates to 12-13x
- Private equity interest emerges
- Revenue growth 8% CAGR

**Fair Value Bull:** 280-300p
**Upside from current:** +48-59%

### Expected Value

```
EV = (180p × 25%) + (225p × 50%) + (290p × 25%)
EV = 45p + 112.5p + 72.5p = 230p

Precio actual: 188.8p
MoS vs EV: 18%
MoS vs Bear: -5% (negativo - precio cerca del bear case)
```

## MOAT ASSESSMENT (Framework v2.0)

**Moat Rating: NARROW**

| Factor | Strength | Evidence |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Scale | Moderate | Largest bus operator outside London; procurement and depot advantages |
| Regulatory barriers | Moderate | TfL contracts require approval; ORR track access for open access |
| Network effects | None | No network effects in bus/rail |
| Switching costs | Low | Passengers switch easily between operators |
| Brand | Low | Brand irrelevant for commodity transport |
| Cost advantages | Moderate | Scale gives some cost advantage vs smaller operators |

**ROIC vs WACC Test:**
- ROIC: ~8-10% historically
- WACC: ~9-10%
- ROIC vs WACC: Marginal/breakeven

**Conclusion:** Does NOT qualify as Wide moat (requires ROIC > WACC for 10+ years). Narrow moat from scale and regulatory barriers, but limited pricing power prevents Wide moat classification.

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT (Framework v2.0)

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigant |
|------|-------------|--------|----------|
| Rail nationalisation removes DfT TOC revenue | 100% | Low (£40m contribution declining to £0) | Already priced in; bus is core now |
| Cost inflation exceeds pricing power | 40% | Medium | £15m restructuring; £3 cap helps revenue |
| Open access routes fail/delayed | 25% | Medium | Track access secured; rolling stock ordered |
| Labour extends nationalisation to bus | 15% | Very High | No indication of this policy direction |
| Dividend cut | 10% | Medium | FCF covers dividend 5x |
| Acquisition integration fails (RATP) | 20% | Medium | Early results positive |

**Overall Risk Level: MEDIUM** - Rail nationalisation is certain but already reflected; bus growth execution is key risk.

---

## QUALITY SCORE (Framework v2.0)

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| ROE >15% consistently | 0/1 | ROE volatile, recently ~18% but thin equity base |
| FCF positive every year (5yr) | 0/1 | FY2022 negative (COVID) |
| Debt/Equity <1.0 | 0/1 | D/E 221% (IFRS16 distortion) |
| Dividend 10+ years | 0/1 | Cut during COVID, restored 2023 |
| Wide moat | 0/1 | Narrow moat only |
| Revenue stability | 0/1 | COVID disruption; nationalisation changes |
| Management quality | 1/1 | Strong capital allocation |
| Analyst coverage >10 | 0/1 | Only 4 analysts |
| Market cap >10B | 0/1 | ~£1B |
| Defensive sector | 0/1 | Transport is cyclical/regulated |
| **Total** | **1/10** | **Tier C technically** |

**Pragmatic Assessment:** Score is distorted by COVID (one-time), IFRS16 (accounting), and transformation (structural change). Post-2022 business quality is higher than score suggests.

**Classification: Tier B (25% MoS required)** - not Tier C because transformation story has evidence (US divestment, buybacks, acquisitions working).

## 7 GATES CHECK (Framework v2.0)

| Gate | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1. Business understanding complete | PASS | Business model, unit economics, margins documented |
| 2. Projection fundamentada | PASS | TAM, share, pricing, WACC derived |
| 3. Valoracion multi-metodo | PASS | EV/EBIT, P/E, DCF - all applied |
| 4. Margen de seguridad (Tier B = 25%) | FAIL | MoS at 188.8p is 17-18% vs 220-230p FV |
| 5. Contexto macro favorable | PASS | UK neutral; not geopolitically exposed |
| 6. Portfolio fit | PASS | Would be first UK transport position |
| 7. Autocritica explicita | PASS | See below |

**Gate 4 FAILS at current price.** Need 165p for 25% MoS.

---

## DECISION

### Precio actual: 188.8p
### Fair Value (base): 220-230p
### MoS actual: 17-18% (insuficiente para Tier B)

### Standing Order: MANTENER en 165p
- At 165p: MoS = 25-28% (meets Tier B threshold)
- Position size: 400 EUR = ~£345 = ~209 shares at 165p
- If price reaches 150p: MoS = 32% - consider larger position (500 EUR)

### Por que no comprar a 188.8p:
1. Gate 4 falla - MoS insuficiente
2. Precio cerca del bear case (180p) - riesgo asimetrico desfavorable
3. Solo 4 analistas - liquidez y visibilidad limitadas
4. Mejor esperar a que H2 FY2026 confirme margen trajectory

### Triggers para revisar thesis:
1. Precio toca 165p - ejecutar standing order
2. FY2026 results (June 2026) - verify EPS growth
3. Stirling route launch (mid-2026) - confirm execution
4. Any Labour policy change on bus sector

---

## AUTOCRITICA

### Asunciones hechas:
- Normalized FCF of £130m may be too conservative (could be £100m) or generous (could be £150m)
- P/E of 11x base case may be generous for company losing rail contracts
- 9.5% WACC may be too low for regulated business with IFRS16 complexity

### Sesgos detectados:
- Attracted by transformation narrative - need to verify bus is truly better business
- Low P/E bias - market may be correct that this deserves trough multiple
- Analyst unanimity (4/4 Buy) may indicate coverage only by bulls

### Evidencia potencialmente ignorada:
- Bus passenger volumes only +2% organic - is secular decline starting?
- H1 2026 net debt rose significantly - cash burn concern?
- Why do so few analysts cover? Institutional disinterest for a reason?

### Que haria un gestor top diferente:
- Probably PASS entirely: low ROIC, regulated, small cap, poor liquidity
- Or: Wait for true distress (150p or below) where even bear case is priced in
- Focus on higher-quality businesses with wider moats

### Lo que me estoy dejando:
- Detailed analysis of each bus region profitability
- Peer comparison with Mobico (formerly National Express) financials
- Deep dive on open access economics vs franchised operators
- Labour transport policy analysis from primary sources
