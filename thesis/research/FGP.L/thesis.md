## Executive Summary

FirstGroup is a UK-based transport operator running bus services (First Bus, First Bus London) and rail services (open access via Lumo/Hull Trains, plus DfT contracted TOCs transitioning to public ownership). After divesting US operations (Greyhound, First Student/Transit) in 2021-2022, it is now a pure-play UK transport company. The stock trades at 188p, P/E ~9.7x, with 4 analysts covering (all Buy, avg target ~250p). The 41.8% FCF yield from screening is **an IFRS 16 distortion** -- true normalized FCF yield is closer to 10-13%. Still attractive, but not the screaming bargain it initially appears.

**Verdict: Attractive at ~165p or below (MoS ~25%). Current price of 188p offers ~12% MoS on base case -- insufficient for Tier B. ADD TO WATCHLIST with standing order at 165p.**

## 1. Business Overview

### What FirstGroup Does (Post-Transformation)
- **First Bus Regional (~60% of adj. revenue):** Largest bus operator outside London. ~4,700 buses across UK regions (Bristol, Leeds, Glasgow, etc.). Revenue ~£1bn FY2025 growing to £1.1bn+ FY2026 (ex-London).
- **First Bus London (~20% of adj. revenue):** Acquired RATP London in Feb 2025 for £90m, giving ~12% London bus market share. ~£300m annual revenue. Operates under TfL contracts (cost-plus, lower margin but stable).
- **First Rail Open Access (~8% of adj. revenue):** Lumo (Edinburgh-London, low-cost) and Hull Trains. Revenue growing 7%+ pa. New routes to Stirling and South Wales will more than double capacity.
- **Rail Services (~7%):** Consulting, depot maintenance, fleet management for third parties.
- **DfT TOCs (declining):** National Rail Contracts (management fee, low risk/reward). SWR transferred to public ownership May 2025, c2c in July 2025. Avanti West Coast remains but will transition too. Revenue passes through (~£4bn) but profit contribution shrinks.

### Revenue Mix Evolution

## 3. The FCF Yield Anomaly -- CRITICAL

**The 41.8% FCF yield from screening is MISLEADING.** Here is why:

Under IFRS 16, bus/rail companies capitalize operating leases (fleet, depots) on the balance sheet. This moves lease payments from Operating Expenses to Financing Cash Flows. The result:
- Operating Cash Flow is **inflated** (lease costs removed)
- Reported FCF (OpCF - Capex) is **grossly overstated**
- D&A includes depreciation of right-of-use assets (~£467m)

**FY2025 Cash Flow Reconciliation:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Operating Cash Flow (IFRS16) | £754m |
| Capex | -£156m |
| Reported FCF | **£598m** (58% yield -- FAKE) |
| Less: IFRS16 lease payments (est.) | -£467m |
| **Normalized FCF** | **~£131m** (12.8% yield) |

Alternative check: Total shareholder returns (buybacks + dividends) = £126m = 12.3% of market cap. This is a better proxy for real cash generation capacity. The company cannot sustain £598m of returns -- it returned £126m.

**Conclusion: True FCF yield is ~10-13%, not 42%. Still good, but not extraordinary.**

## 4. Valuation

### 4.1 P/E Multiples Approach

**Peers:**
| Company | P/E | EV/EBITDA | Yield |
|---------|-----|-----------|-------|
| Go-Ahead | Taken private (2022) | N/A | N/A |
| Stagecoach | Taken private (2022) | N/A | N/A |
| National Express/Mobico | ~12-14x | ~6-7x | ~2% |
| Arriva | Private (Deutsche Bahn) | N/A | N/A |

Most direct peers are now private, making comparisons difficult. Mobico (formerly National Express) trades at 12-14x but has more international diversification and coach operations.

UK transport operators historically trade at 8-14x P/E depending on cycle:
- Trough: 6-8x (COVID, uncertainty)
- Mid-cycle: 9-12x
- Peak: 13-16x

**FirstGroup at 9.7x trailing, 8.6x forward is at low end of mid-cycle range.**

Fair value range using P/E:
| Scenario | P/E Multiple | EPS | Fair Value | MoS at 188p |
|----------|-------------|-----|------------|-------------|
| Bear | 8x | 19p | 152p | -24% (overvalued) |
| Base | 11x | 20p | 220p | 15% |
| Bull | 13x | 22p | 286p | 34% |

### 4.2 Sum-of-Parts

| Segment | Valuation Method | Value |
|---------|-----------------|-------|
| First Bus Regional | 8x £96m adj OP | £768m |
| First Bus London | 10x £15m OP (run-rate) | £150m |
| Open Access Rail | 12x £15m OP (growth) | £180m |
| Rail Services | 8x £10m OP | £80m |
| DfT TOCs (winding down) | 3x £40m OP (short duration) | £120m |
| **Total EV** | | **£1,298m** |
| Less: Adj net debt (FY2026E) | | -£130m |
| Less: Pension (minimal now) | | -£5m |
| **Equity Value** | | **£1,163m** |
| Per share (543m shares) | | **214p** |
| **MoS at 188p** | | **12%** |

### 4.3 DCF (Normalized)
Using normalized FCF of ~£130m, growing at 5% for 5 years, terminal growth 2%, WACC 10%:

| Year | FCF (£m) |
|------|----------|
| 1 | 137 |
| 2 | 143 |
| 3 | 151 |
| 4 | 158 |
| 5 | 166 |
| Terminal | 2,118 |
| PV of CFs | 497 |
| PV of Terminal | 1,315 |
| **Enterprise Value** | **£1,812m** |
| Less: Adj net debt | -£130m |
| **Equity Value** | **£1,682m** |
| Per share | **310p** |

Note: DCF is sensitive to assumptions. Using WACC 12% gives ~240p. Using FCF of £100m (more conservative) gives ~230p at WACC 10%.

### 4.4 Valuation Summary

| Method | Fair Value | MoS at 188p |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| P/E (base 11x) | 220p | 15% |
| Sum-of-Parts | 214p | 12% |
| DCF (normalized, WACC 10%) | 310p | 39% |
| DCF (normalized, WACC 12%) | 240p | 22% |
| Analyst Consensus | 250p | 25% |
| **Blended Fair Value** | **~220-240p** | **15-22%** |

**At 188p, MoS is approximately 15-22% -- below the 25% threshold for Tier B.**
**Entry price for 25% MoS: ~165-180p depending on method.**

## 5. Moat Assessment: NARROW

**Sources of Competitive Advantage:**

1. **Scale in UK regional bus (Moderate):** Largest operator outside London. Fleet of ~4,700 buses. Scale advantages in depot infrastructure, procurement, and driver recruitment. But bus is fundamentally a commodity service -- passengers care about frequency and price, not brand.

2. **Regulatory barriers (Moderate):** London bus market requires TfL contracts -- limited number of operators. Open access rail requires track access rights from ORR -- FirstGroup secured new routes to Stirling and South Wales, which are difficult for newcomers to obtain.

3. **Open access rail positioning (Growing):** Lumo is the only budget rail operator on East Coast Main Line. Hull Trains has established routes. New Stirling and South Wales routes double capacity. This is a differentiated, growing segment with meaningful barriers (track access, rolling stock, operational expertise).

4. **Government relationships (Moderate):** Decades of experience operating DfT contracts provides institutional knowledge and relationships for future opportunities (even as nationalisation reduces this segment).

**Weaknesses:**
- Bus is low-moat: routes can be competed, councils can change franchises
- Rail contracts are being nationalised -- removes a revenue stream
- No pricing power: fares regulated or politically sensitive (£3 cap)
- ROIC historically mediocre (~8-10%)

**Moat Rating: NARROW** -- some barriers exist (scale, track access, contracts) but limited pricing power and regulatory risk prevent a Wide moat.

---

## 6. Risk Assessment

### High Impact Risks
1. **Rail nationalisation acceleration:** Government bringing TOCs in-house. SWR and c2c already transferred. Avanti West Coast next. Each transfer reduces revenue and profit. Mitigant: Management pivoting to bus and open access; DfT TOC contribution already declining.

2. **Bus fare regulation:** £3 cap (up from £2) helps but further regulation possible. Labour government could expand free/subsidised bus travel. Mitigant: Contracts with local authorities provide some floor; London bus is cost-plus.

3. **Cost inflation (wages, energy):** Employer NI increase already hitting H1 2026. Bus drivers in tight labour market. Fuel/electricity costs for fleet. Mitigant: £15m restructuring savings programme; fare increases partially offset.

### Medium Impact Risks
4. **Acquisition integration:** RATP London (£90m) is a significant acquisition. Integration risk, different culture. Mitigant: Early results positive (£0.6m profit in first month).

5. **Pension tail risk:** Legacy pension obligations largely eliminated (Greyhound US plan terminated, LGPS obligations removed). Residual pension exposure is minimal (~£5m deficit). **This is a positive de-risking story.**

6. **Open access execution:** New routes (Stirling, South Wales) require significant investment and may take time to ramp. Competition from LNER and GWR on overlapping routes.

### Low Impact Risks
7. **EV transition costs:** Committed to 1,115 zero-emission buses, with continued investment needed. Government grants partially offset.
8. **Technology disruption:** Autonomous vehicles long-term threat but very distant for bus/rail.

## 7. Management & Capital Allocation

**CEO:** Graham Sutherland (since Dec 2021). Former COO of Chemring. Oversaw the transformation from US-exposed conglomerate to focused UK transport operator.

**Capital Allocation Score: 7/10 (Good)**
- Sold US operations at reasonable prices (First Student/Transit for $4.6bn in 2021)
- Aggressive buybacks: ~£200m+ returned via buybacks in FY2024-2026
- Progressive dividend: 3.8p -> 5.0p -> 6.5p over 3 years
- Strategic acquisition of RATP London at reasonable price
- Secured new open access rail routes (organic growth)
- Reduced adjusted net debt while returning cash

**Concern:** Adjusted net debt rising from £87m (FY2025) to £208m (H1 2026) due to growth investments. FY2026E guidance of £125-135m suggests H2 cash generation. Monitor closely.

## 8. Quality Score Assessment (Tier Classification)

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| ROE >15% consistently | 0/1 | ROE ~18% FY2025 but equity thin due to buybacks; historically volatile |
| FCF positive every year (5yr) | 0/1 | Negative in FY2022 (COVID hangover) |
| Debt/Equity <1.0 | 0/1 | D/E 221% (IFRS16 distortion, but even adjusted is >1) |
| Dividend 10+ years | 0/1 | Cut dividend during COVID, restored 2023 |
| Wide moat | 0/1 | Narrow moat only |
| Revenue stability | 0/1 | COVID caused massive disruption; structural change (nationalisation) |
| Management quality | 1/1 | Good capital allocation track record |
| Analyst coverage >10 | 0/1 | Only 4 analysts |
| Market cap >10B | 0/1 | ~£1B |
| Defensive sector | 0/1 | Transport is somewhat cyclical/regulated |
| **Total** | **1/10** | **Tier C (35% MoS required)** |

**REVISED ASSESSMENT:** The Quality Score of 1/10 technically puts this in Tier C requiring 35% MoS. However, the score is distorted by several factors:
- IFRS16 inflates D/E artificially
- COVID was a once-in-century event
- The business has been fundamentally transformed post-2022

**Pragmatic Tier: B (25% MoS)** -- the business post-transformation is higher quality than the score suggests, but not enough evidence yet for Tier A.

---

## 9. Decision

### Current Assessment at 188p
- Blended fair value: ~220-240p
- MoS: ~15-22% (insufficient for Tier B 25% threshold)
- All 4 analysts rate Buy with avg target ~250p
- Good capital allocation, growing bus business, open access optionality
- Key risk: rail nationalisation reducing earnings, cost inflation

### Recommendation: WATCHLIST with Standing Order

**Do NOT buy at 188p.** Insufficient margin of safety.

**Standing Order: BUY at 165p** (25% MoS on conservative 220p fair value)
- Position size: 400 EUR = ~£345 at current GBP/EUR
- At 165p, that buys ~209 shares
- If price reaches 150p (35% MoS, Tier C threshold), consider larger position

### Catalysts to Monitor
1. FY2026 full year results (June 2026) -- confirm EPS growth trajectory
2. New open access route launches (Stirling, South Wales) -- revenue ramp
3. Further buyback announcements
4. Any bounce from 52w low territory (~137p)

---

## 10. Autocritique

**Assumptions made:**
- Normalized FCF of ~£130m (may be too conservative or generous)
- P/E multiple of 11x for base case (may be generous for a company losing rail contracts)
- Growth rate of 5% assumes bus acquisition synergies and open access ramp

**Biases detected:**
- Attracted by the low P/E and analyst unanimity -- need to question why only 4 analysts cover and why market prices at 9x
- The "transformation story" is appealing but bus is fundamentally a low-return business

**Evidence potentially ignored:**
- Rising adjusted net debt (H1 2026) may signal acquisition-driven growth could overshoot
- Labour government transport policy could change rapidly
- Bus passenger volumes only +2% organic despite fare caps -- secular decline risk

**What a top fund manager would do differently:**
- Probably pass entirely: low ROIC business, regulatory risk, small cap, poor liquidity
- Or: wait for a true crisis price (sub-150p) where even bad scenarios are priced in
