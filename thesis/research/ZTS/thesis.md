# ZTS - Zoetis Inc.

> **Fair Value:** $120
> **Date:** 2026-02-13
> **Pipeline Stage:** R3_COMPLETE (Post-Adversarial Resolution)
> **R3 Resolution:** Analyst $140, DA $115-125, Weighted → $120. Librela 9x adverse events, Apoquel patent Nov 2026, vet visit decline. QS 78→73 (Tier A→B).
> **Analyst:** fundamental-analyst (Claude)

## TL;DR

Zoetis is the global #1 animal health company with a 17% market share, 70%+ gross margins, 30% ROIC, and a 21pp ROIC-WACC spread -- among the widest in all of healthcare. The business is a textbook quality compounder with durable moats (regulatory barriers, vet relationships, diagnostics ecosystem lock-in). At $126, the stock trades near its 52-week low (-29% from highs) due to Librela safety concerns, FX headwinds, and decelerating growth guidance (3-5% organic for 2026). However, the market is underpricing the long-term compounding engine: 6%+ organic revenue growth, margin expansion runway via diagnostics, and pet humanization megatrend. Fair value $140 implies only 10% MoS at current price -- insufficient for our framework. **WATCHLIST** with entry target $110-115.

## Quality Score

**QS Tool: 73/100 (Tier B)**

**QS Adjusted: 78/100 (Tier A) -- Adjustment: +5 points**

Adjustment rationale with quantitative evidence:
- **Market Position: +5 pts (0 -> 5/8):** quality_scorer.py defaults market_position to 0/8 (known tool bias, Session 61 lesson). Zoetis is undisputed global #1 in animal health with 17% market share, nearly 2x the #2 player (MSD Animal Health at ~10%). This earns 8/8 per the scoring rubric (#1-2 position), but the tool gives 0. Conservative adjustment: +5 (not full +8, acknowledging tool bias awareness from Session 61).
- Net adjustment: +5 points. Within the 5-point threshold, so no further documentation required, but I am providing it for completeness.

**QS Adjusted: 78/100 = Tier A (Quality Compounder)**

### Detailed Breakdown

| Category | Tool Score | Adjusted | Notes |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Financial | 38/40 | 38/40 | Exceptional. ROIC 30.3%, spread +21.3pp. FCF margin 24.8%. Only loses 2pts on leverage (1.3x = 8/10) |
| Growth | 13/25 | 13/25 | Revenue CAGR 6%, EPS CAGR 8.4%. Both above 5% but below 10%. GM stable. Adequate, not exceptional |
| Moat | 17/25 | 22/25 | Tool gives 0/8 market position (default bug). Adjusted to 5/8. GM premium +15.6pp. ROIC persistence 7/7 |
| Capital Allocation | 5/10 | 5/10 | Dividend yield 1.7%, payout 32.5%. But insider ownership only 0.1% (institutional 98.2%) |
| **TOTAL** | **73/100** | **78/100** | |

## Business Understanding

### Business Model

Zoetis (spun off from Pfizer in 2013) is the world's largest animal health company, operating across two segments:

**Companion Animal (~68% of revenue):** Pharmaceuticals, vaccines, diagnostics, and services for dogs, cats, and horses. Key franchises:
- **Simparica Trio** (parasiticides) -- market-leading combination product, FDA-approved label expansion for tapeworm prevention
- **Apoquel / Cytopoint** (dermatology) -- blockbuster anti-itch franchise for dogs
- **Librela / Solensia** (monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain) -- $568M in 2025 (-3% operational), under pressure from FDA safety warnings
- **Diagnostics** -- 13% operational growth in 2025; VETSCAN point-of-care platform, reference labs (acquired ZNLabs, VPG UK), emerging razor/blade model

**Livestock (~31% of revenue):** Vaccines, anti-infectives, and medicated feed additives for cattle, swine, poultry, fish, and sheep. More cyclical but provides geographic and business cycle diversification.

**Geographic Split:** ~50% US, ~50% International (Europe, LatAm, Asia). 2025 showed US flat, International +8% (operational).

### What Problem It Solves

Animal health is a **must-have** expenditure -- pet owners treat pets as family members (humanization trend), and livestock producers need to protect animal welfare for food production. The spend is non-discretionary and recurring.

### Revenue Model

The dominant model is **consumables/repeat purchase** -- medications administered monthly (Simparica Trio), annually (vaccines), or as needed (Apoquel). This creates high recurring revenue visibility. Diagnostics adds a **razor/blade** component (instruments placed in clinics, consumable cartridges generate revenue). Approximately 70-80% of revenue is recurring/repeat.

### Unit Economics

Zoetis's unit economics are excellent:
- **Customer acquisition:** Relationships are built through veterinarian detailing and clinical evidence. Once a vet adopts a product, switching is rare (habit + clinical familiarity + diagnostic ecosystem integration).
- **LTV/CAC:** Not directly available, but proxied by the 70%+ gross margins and 30%+ ROIC -- indicative of LTV/CAC well above 5x.
- **Payback:** Quick -- drugs are prescribed and sold immediately. No long sales cycle.

### Margin Structure

| Metric | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025E | Trend |
|--------|------|------|------|------|-------|-------|
| Gross Margin | 70.4% | 69.6% | 70.0% | 70.6% | ~71% | Stable, slight expansion |
| Operating Margin | 36.0% | 36.2% | 35.9% | 36.6% | ~37% | Stable, slight expansion |
| FCF Margin | 22.3% | 16.4% | 19.0% | 24.8% | ~25% | Improving |
| Net Margin | ~24% | ~25% | ~27% | ~28% | ~28% | Expanding |

The gross margin of 70.6% is 15.6pp above the healthcare sector median, reflecting pricing power and IP protection. Operating margins are consistently 36%+, demonstrating strong cost discipline and operating leverage.

### Capital Intensity

- **Capex/Revenue:** ~7% ($676M capex on ~$9.5B revenue). Asset-medium.
- **Maintenance capex** (approximate): ~$500M (depreciation ~$450M x 1.1)
- **Working capital:** Moderate user of working capital. Inventory + receivables management typical of pharma.

## Why Is It Cheap?

### Current Valuation Context

ZTS trades at $125.64, -29% from 52-week high of $177. P/E TTM ~21x, which is well below the 5-year average of ~35-40x.

### Market Narratives

1. **[X] Librela safety concerns** -- FDA "Dear Veterinarian" letter, adverse event reports (3,800+ in US, 20,000+ in EU), updated labeling. Revenue declined 3% operationally in 2025, with 11% drop in Q4. Class action lawsuit dismissed but more litigation expected.

2. **[X] Guidance decepcionante** -- 2026 organic growth guided at 3-5%, down from 6% in 2025 and 8%+ historical. FX headwinds of ~3% on reported revenue. Market sees deceleration.

3. **[X] Sector out-of-favor** -- Animal health / healthcare broadly under pressure as "higher for longer" compresses multiples on growth stocks.

4. **[X] Competitive pressure** -- Elanco's Credelio Quattro launch (6-in-1 parasiticide), increased promotional activity in dermatology and parasiticides.

### My Counter-Thesis

| Market Believes | I Believe | Evidence | Prob Wrong |
|----------------|-----------|----------|------------|
| Librela franchise is impaired | Librela headwinds are temporary; Lenivia (3-month formulation) approved in Canada/EU addresses compliance concerns | Class action dismissed, FDA requires labeling not withdrawal. Lenivia launch provides new growth vector. OA TAM growing 22% CAGR. | 25% |
| Growth is decelerating structurally | 2026 guidance conservative; diagnostics +13% growth is the new growth engine | Historical pattern: ZTS guides conservatively then beats. Diagnostics razor/blade model creates sticky recurring revenue with above-company-avg growth. | 20% |
| P/E compression is justified | P/E ~21x vs historical 35-40x overreacts; ROIC of 30% and 21pp spread justify premium | Companies with 30%+ ROIC and 70%+ GM rarely trade at 21x for extended periods. Mean reversion expected over 12-24 months. | 20% |
| Competition will erode margins | ZTS's ecosystem (drugs + diagnostics + data) creates lock-in that pure pharma competitors cannot replicate | GM has been 70%+ for 4+ years despite competition. Simparica Trio label expansion and diagnostics ecosystem differentiate. | 15% |

### Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | SI/NO | Commentary |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Secular decline | NO | Animal health TAM growing 6-10% CAGR through 2033 |
| Technological disruption | NO | Zoetis IS the innovator (mAbs, AI diagnostics, gene editing) |
| Management destroying value | NO | Consistent capital allocation, buybacks, growing dividend |
| Balance deteriorating | NO | Net Debt/EBITDA 1.3x, interest coverage 14.9x |
| Insider selling massive | NO | Low insider ownership (0.1%) but no mass selling |
| Dividend cut likely | NO | Payout 32.5%, well covered. Dividend growing annually |
| Market share loss >2pp 3yr | NO | Maintaining/gaining share. #1 position stable |
| ROIC < WACC 3yr | NO | ROIC 24-30% consistently, WACC 8.9%. Spread +21pp |
| FCF negative >2yr | NO | FCF positive 4/4 years, growing from $1.3B to $2.3B |
| Goodwill >50% equity | NO | Goodwill reasonable relative to asset base |

**Value Trap Score: 0/10** -- No value trap indicators.

### My Informational Advantage

- [X] Horizonte temporal mas largo -- Market is focused on 2026 guidance (3-5%). I see a 5-10 year compounder.
- [X] Mercado sobre-reacciona -- Librela safety narrative is overdone (class action dismissed, FDA requires labeling not withdrawal).
- [ ] Ninguna clara -- N/A. There is a reasonable informational advantage from multi-year horizon.

## Growth Projections

### TAM Analysis

- **Global Animal Health TAM (2025):** $63-67B (sources vary)
- **Projected TAM (2033):** $150-163B, implying ~10% CAGR
- **Companion Animal sub-TAM:** Growing faster (~8-12% CAGR) driven by pet humanization, rising pet ownership, aging pet population
- **Livestock sub-TAM:** Growing ~4-6% CAGR driven by food security, protein demand, aquaculture
- **Diagnostics sub-TAM:** Growing ~12-15% CAGR, increasingly integrated into veterinary workflows

**Zoetis targets the market growing to ~$90B** by management's estimates at their investor day.

### Market Share Analysis

- **Current Share:** ~17% global (#1, nearly 2x #2 MSD Animal Health)
- **Trend:** Stable to slightly gaining via diagnostics and new product launches
- **Projection Year +3:** ~17.5% (diagnostics share gains, new launches)
- **Projection Year +5:** ~18% (ecosystem lock-in from diagnostics + pharma integration)

### Pricing Power

- **Strong:** Zoetis has demonstrated ability to take 2-3% annual price increases across its portfolio
- **Evidence:** Gross margins stable at 70%+ despite inflation and competition
- **Risk:** Promotional intensity increasing in parasiticides/dermatology as Elanco and Boehringer compete. May compress pricing power in specific categories.

### Revenue Growth Derivation

```
Revenue Growth = TAM Growth + Delta Market Share + Pricing

TAM Growth: +5-6% (blended companion + livestock)
Market Share: +0.3pp/year (diagnostics-driven)
Pricing: +2% (historical average, conservative)
= Revenue Growth: ~7-8% organic

BUT: 2026 guidance is only 3-5% organic (conservative by management)
Adjusted for guidance: Year 1-2 at 5-6%, Years 3-5 at 7-8%
```

### Margin Projections

- **Gross Margin:** 70-71% (stable; slight expansion from diagnostics mix shift)
- **Operating Margin:** 37-38% by Year 3 (scale leverage on diagnostics infrastructure)
- **FCF Margin:** 25-27% (capex intensity normalizing after diagnostics lab buildout)

### WACC Derivation

```
Risk-Free Rate (10Y US Treasury): 4.5%
Equity Risk Premium: 5.0%
Beta: 0.96 (from quality_scorer.py)
Cost of Equity (Ke): 4.5% + 0.96 * 5.0% = 9.3%

Cost of Debt (Kd): 3.1% (from tool)
Tax Rate: 20.3% effective
Kd after-tax: 3.1% * (1 - 0.203) = 2.47%

Market Cap: $55.7B
Total Debt: $7.3B
E/V: 88.4%
D/V: 11.6%

WACC = (88.4% * 9.3%) + (11.6% * 2.47%)
WACC = 8.22% + 0.29%
WACC = 8.5%

Note: quality_scorer.py calculated WACC 8.9% using different approach.
I use 8.5% for base case (my derivation) and cross-check with tool's 9.0%.
```

### Terminal Growth

2.5% -- Justified because:
- Animal health TAM growing 6-10% long-term
- Pet humanization is a secular trend (not cyclical)
- Zoetis has pricing power to pass inflation
- 2.5% is below GDP growth, conservative for this industry

---

## Valuation

### Method 1: DCF (25% weight -- downweighted due to sensitivity)

Using derived parameters: Growth 7% (blended Y1-5), WACC 9%, Terminal 2.5%

From DCF tool:
- **Bear (Growth 5%, WACC 10%):** FV $67
- **Base (Growth 7%, WACC 9%):** FV $88
- **Bull (Growth 9%, WACC 8%):** FV $127 (interpolated from sensitivity)

**DCF Sensitivity Assessment:**
- FV Spread: 87% -- HIGH
- TV as % of EV: 75-77% -- HIGH
- **Conclusion:** DCF is UNRELIABLE as a point estimate. Use as range indicator.

The DCF overly penalizes ZTS because:
1. It uses trailing FCF ($2.30B) as base, but FCF was depressed in 2022-2023 by elevated capex during diagnostics lab buildout. Normalized FCF is closer to $2.5B.
2. The 5-year projection horizon is too short for a compounder with 20+ year moats.
3. Terminal value dominance (75%+) means the DCF is essentially a perpetuity valuation.

### Method 2: Owner Earnings Yield (30% weight)

```
FCF (2024): $2.30B
Depreciation: ~$450M
Maintenance Capex: ~$500M (D&A * 1.1)
Owner Earnings = $2.30B - $500M + $450M = $2.25B
Market Cap: $55.7B

Owner Earnings Yield = $2.25B / $55.7B = 4.04%

OEY + Expected Growth = 4.04% + 7% = 11.04%
vs WACC = 8.5%
Spread = +2.5pp -- positive but modest

Precedent comparison:
- ADBE at purchase: OEY + Growth ~10-12% (MoS 31%)
- NVO at purchase: OEY + Growth ~12-14% (MoS 38%)
- ZTS at current price: OEY + Growth = 11.0% -- in range but not exceptional
```

**OEY-implied Fair Value:**
- Target OEY + Growth = 12%: Required OEY = 5% -> FV ~$102/share
- Target OEY + Growth = 10%: Required OEY = 3% -> FV ~$170/share
- **OEY midpoint: ~$135**

### Method 3: EV/EBIT Relative (25% weight)

```
EBIT 2025: ~$3.5B (operating margin 37% x $9.47B revenue)
Quality adjustments for ZTS:
  Base (pharma sector median): 12x
  + Superior ROIC (+21pp spread): +2x
  + Wide moat (#1 position, 70% GM): +2x
  + Above-avg growth vs mature pharma: +1x
  - Low insider ownership: -0.5x
  = Justified multiple: 16.5x

Using 2026E EBIT (~$3.7B based on guidance):
EV = $3.7B * 16.5x = $61.05B
Equity = $61.05B - $5.2B = $55.85B
FV = $55.85B / 440.7M shares = $127/share
```

**Forward EV/EBIT suggests FV ~$127.**

### Method 4: Reverse DCF (Sanity Check, 20% weight)

The reverse DCF shows the market prices in ~15% FCF growth at current $126. My estimated FCF growth: 7-10% (base case). This means ZTS is pricing in growth above what I estimate, suggesting the stock is near fair value or modestly overvalued at $126 on a pure DCF basis.

Adjusting for normalized FCF ($2.5B base instead of $2.30B), implied growth drops to ~12%, closer to my bull case.

**Reverse DCF implies $126 = approximately fair value.**

### Reconciliation

| Method | Fair Value | Weight | Weighted |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| DCF Base | $88 | 25% | $22.00 |
| OEY Midpoint | $135 | 30% | $40.50 |
| EV/EBIT (2026E forward) | $127 | 25% | $31.75 |
| Reverse DCF | $126 (fair) | 20% | $25.20 |
| **Weighted Average** | | **100%** | **$119** |

**Divergence:** DCF ($88) vs OEY ($135) = 53%, which is >30%.

**Reason:** DCF mechanically uses trailing FCF and a 5-year horizon that penalizes quality compounders with long-duration moats. The EV/EBIT and Reverse DCF cluster at $126-127, suggesting ZTS is near fair value. The OEY method captures the compounding premium better.

**Final Fair Value: $140**

Rationale: The $119 weighted average uses current-year metrics. I add a 15-18% quality compounder premium based on:
- Forward EV/EBIT on 2027E earnings: ~$138-149
- OEY + Growth spread of +2.5pp vs WACC (positive, value-creating)
- 0/10 value trap score with secular TAM growth
- Historical P/E mean reversion potential (21x vs 35-40x historical)

This premium is conservative -- I am NOT relying on full multiple expansion to 35x (which would imply $210+). I am saying that a business with 30% ROIC, 21pp spread, #1 market position, and secular growth tailwinds deserves a modest premium to near-term mechanistic valuations.

## Scenarios

| | Bear | Base | Bull |
|--|------|------|------|
| Assumption | Librela pulled/massively impaired. Growth <3%. Multiple compresses to 18x P/E. Competition erodes margins. | 5-7% organic growth. Diagnostics +12%. Margins stable-expanding. P/E normalizes to 25x. | 8-10% organic growth. Librela/Lenivia fully recover. Diagnostics becomes dominant franchise. P/E 30x. |
| Revenue 2028 | $10.5B | $11.5B | $12.8B |
| EPS 2028 | $6.50 | $7.80 | $9.50 |
| FV | $105 | $140 | $190 |
| Prob | 25% | 50% | 25% |

### Expected Value

```
EV = (Bear * 25%) + (Base * 50%) + (Bull * 25%)
EV = ($105 * 0.25) + ($140 * 0.50) + ($190 * 0.25)
EV = $26.25 + $70 + $47.50
EV = $143.75

Current Price: $125.64
MoS vs Expected Value: +14.4%
MoS vs Bear: -16.4% (downside from bear scenario)
MoS vs Base: +11.4%
```

---

## Margin of Safety Assessment

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| MoS vs Base FV ($140) | +10.3% |
| MoS vs Expected Value ($143.75) | +14.4% |
| MoS vs Bear ($105) | -16.4% |
| Required for Tier A (per precedents) | 15-30% (ADBE 31%, NVO 38%, LULU 34%) |
| Required for Tier B (per precedents) | 20-25% |

**Verdict: Insufficient MoS at current price.**

The 10-14% MoS is below what we have historically required for Tier A or Tier B positions. Our precedents show:
- Tier A buys: ADBE at 31%, NVO at 38%, LULU at 34%, MONY.L at 36%, AUTO.L at 29%
- Even the lowest Tier A entry (AUTO.L at 29%) is nearly 3x the current MoS for ZTS

ZTS needs to trade at $110-115 to offer 20-25% MoS, which would be consistent with our Tier B precedents and approaching Tier A territory.

---

## Entry Price

**Target entry: $110-115 ($105 for full position)**

Rationale:
- At $110: MoS ~21% vs base FV, ~23% vs EV. Consistent with Tier B precedents.
- At $105: MoS ~25% vs base FV. Approaching Tier A MoS territory.
- At $115: MoS ~18% vs base FV. Minimum acceptable for a quality compounder.

The stock is at $126 today. It would need to decline another 8-16% to reach entry range. This is plausible given:
- Q4 2025 results just reported (Feb 12) -- market reaction will set near-term direction
- Librela concerns may persist through Q2-Q3 2026 safety updates
- FX headwinds if USD strengthens
- Broader market correction if CPI surprises hot tomorrow (Feb 13)

---

## Kill Conditions

1. **KC#1: ROIC falls below WACC for 2+ consecutive quarters** -- The 21pp ROIC-WACC spread is ZTS's core investment case. If ROIC compresses to <10% (from 30%), the compounding engine is broken.

2. **KC#2: Librela/Solensia pulled from market by FDA** -- Full product withdrawal (not just labeling changes) would eliminate the $568M mAb franchise and signal regulatory risk for pipeline products. Label changes alone are NOT a kill condition.

3. **KC#3: Gross margin falls below 65% for 2 consecutive years** -- The 70%+ GM reflects pricing power and IP moat. A sustained decline below 65% (>5pp compression) would signal competitive erosion.

4. **KC#4: Companion Animal revenue declines >5% organic for 2 consecutive quarters** -- This would signal structural demand destruction, not cyclical weakness.

5. **KC#5: Loss of #1 market position** -- If MSD Animal Health or Boehringer overtakes ZTS in global revenue, the scale moat is compromised.

6. **KC#6: Dividend cut** -- With 32.5% payout and growing FCF, a dividend cut would signal severe management concern about future cash flows.

7. **KC#7: Management change to aggressive acquirer** -- If ZTS shifts from organic innovation to serial M&A (goodwill >50% equity), the ROIC profile would deteriorate. Current strategy is organic innovation + bolt-on acquisitions (ZNLabs, VPG).

---

## Macro Connection

| Factor | Sensitivity | Current Impact |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| Interest rates | Medium | Higher rates compress P/E multiples, but business fundamentals unaffected. WACC impact modest. |
| Recession | Low | Animal health is defensive -- pet owners maintain vet spending even in recession (humanization trend). Livestock more exposed. |
| Inflation | Low-Medium | Strong pricing power (70%+ GM stable through inflation cycles). Input costs manageable. |
| USD strength | Medium | ~50% international revenue. Strong USD reduces reported growth. 2026 FX headwind ~3%. |
| Commodity prices | Low | Not a significant input cost driver for animal health. |

**Fit with World View:** ZTS fits well with the current macro environment:
- Defensive business in uncertain macro (inflation sticky, tariffs, rate uncertainty)
- Pet humanization is a structural megatrend (aligns with demographics, aging population)
- USD weakness (DXY ~96.8) is actually FAVORABLE for ZTS's international revenue
- Healthcare sector broadly out of favor = contrarian opportunity

---

## Compounder Assessment

### Quality Compounder Checklist

```
[X] Quality Score >=75 (adjusted 78)
[X] ROIC > WACC consistently 10+ years (ROIC 24-30% vs WACC 8.5-9%)
[X] FCF positive and growing ($1.3B -> $2.3B over 3 years)
[X] Moat identifiable and quantifiable (#1 position, 70%+ GM, diagnostics ecosystem)
[X] Sustainable growth (TAM $60B -> $150B+, pet humanization secular trend)
[X] Management with track record (consistent execution since 2013 spin-off)
[X] No structural disruption imminent (ZTS IS the innovator)
```

**All 7 criteria met. ZTS qualifies as Quality Compounder.**

However, the stock does not currently offer adequate MoS for entry. This is the classic compounder dilemma -- the market generally recognizes quality and prices it accordingly. The current -29% drawdown from highs is meaningful but not yet deep enough for our framework.

---

## Catalysts

| Catalyst | Timeframe | Prob | Impact |
|----------|-----------|------|--------|
| Librela/Lenivia safety concerns resolve (positive post-market data) | 6-12m | Medium | +15-20% (re-rates mAb franchise from $0 value to fair) |
| Next-gen chemistry diagnostics launch (2026) | 0-6m | High | +5-10% (accelerates diagnostics flywheel) |
| FX tailwinds if USD continues weakening | 0-6m | Medium | +3-5% (reverses 2025-2026 headwinds) |
| Broader healthcare sector re-rating | 6-18m | Medium | +10-15% (sector mean reversion) |
| New parasiticide or dermatology blockbuster | 12-24m | Medium | +10-15% (ZTS has 12 potential blockbusters in pipeline) |
| Market correction brings price to entry range | 0-12m | Medium | Creates entry opportunity at $110-115 |

---

## Veredicto: WATCHLIST

**NOT BUY at current $126.** MoS of 10-14% is insufficient per our framework and precedents.

**Entry target: $110-115** (20-25% MoS). Set standing order at $115 initially.

**Sizing at entry:** 3-4% initial position (consistent with Tier A/B precedents: ADBE 4.8%, NVO 3.4%, AUTO.L 3.4%).

**ADD trigger:** $105 (25% MoS, approaching deep value for a compounder of this quality).

**What could make me buy sooner at $126?**
- Nothing within the current framework. The price needs to come to us.
- Exception: A market-wide crash (S&P -15%+) that brings ZTS to $110-115 range.

---

## META-REFLECTION

### Incertidumbres/Dudas

1. **DCF vs OEY divergence is significant (53%).** The DCF suggests ZTS is overvalued at $126, while OEY and EV/EBIT suggest it's near fair value. This is a classic challenge with quality compounders -- DCF penalizes them because terminal value dominates. I resolved this by weighting OEY and EV/EBIT more heavily, which feels right for a compounder but introduces subjective judgment.

2. **Librela risk is hard to quantify.** The franchise is $568M (6% of revenue) but its impairment could signal broader regulatory risk for ZTS's mAb platform (Lenivia, Solensia, future products). I've treated it as temporary based on the class action dismissal, but if FDA takes stronger action, the bear case deepens.

3. **2026 guidance of 3-5% is notably below historical 6%+ growth.** Management says it's conservative and FX-driven, but it could also signal genuine deceleration in the companion animal segment. The diagnostics +13% growth partially offsets but doesn't fully compensate.

4. **Insider ownership of 0.1% is a weakness.** For a $56B company this is not unusual (institutional dominance), but it means management's incentives are stock-option-driven rather than owner-operator aligned.

### Sugerencias de Mejora

- **Tool improvement:** quality_scorer.py should have market_position override capability (`--market-position 8` flag) instead of defaulting to 0/8 for all companies. This is a known bias (Session 61 lesson) affecting every analysis.

- **Compounder valuation framework:** For Tier A compounders, the DCF tool consistently undervalues because of the 5-year horizon and terminal value sensitivity. Consider a 10-year DCF option or a dedicated "compounder DCF" that extends the projection period.

### Anomalias Detectadas

- **ZTS reported Q4 2025 earnings TODAY (Feb 12).** The price ($126) already reflects post-earnings reaction. Revenue $2.4B beat, EPS $1.48 adj beat $1.40 estimate. Stock appears flat-to-slightly-up post-earnings. Beats without upside suggest expectations were already baked in.

- **FCF trajectory shows unusual 2022 dip** ($1.33B from $1.74B) before recovering to $2.30B in 2024. This was driven by elevated capex during the diagnostics lab buildout and working capital timing, not business deterioration.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator

1. Should we add ZTS to the quality_universe.yaml with entry price $115 and FV $140?
2. Given ZTS just reported earnings today, should we wait for the market to fully digest results before setting the standing order entry?
3. Does the pharma-healthcare sector view need updating to include Animal Health as a distinct subsector?
