# Proximus (PROX.BR) - Investment Thesis v2

**Date:** 2026-02-01 (updated from 2026-01-31)
**Analyst:** Claude Fundamental Analyst
**Previous Decision:** AVOID (2026-01-31)
**Current Decision: CONDITIONAL BUY -- wait for Feb 27 strategic plan**

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Proximus is Belgium's largest telecom incumbent (53% state-owned), trading at EUR 7.68 with extreme valuation discount (EV/EBITDA 3.1x vs 6-7x sector). The previous thesis (Jan 31) concluded AVOID based on value trap concerns. This update refines the analysis with deeper capex normalization modeling and peer comparisons. The core question is: **is the market pricing permanent impairment, or temporary capex-driven FCF depression?**

**My conclusion: somewhere in between.** The stock is likely undervalued, but the magnitude depends heavily on capex normalization speed and DIGI's competitive impact. Fair value range: EUR 8-14/share. At EUR 7.68, there IS margin of safety on the base case, but it is thin on the pessimistic scenario. The Feb 27, 2026 strategic plan is the key near-term catalyst that will clarify the trajectory.

## 3. Moat Assessment: NARROW (stable, not weakening)

| Factor | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Infrastructure (fiber+mobile) | 8/10 | EUR 3B fiber program, 41% coverage, 2.5M premises. Irreplaceable. |
| Incumbency/Scale | 6/10 | 43% national share, 60%+ in Brussels. #1 in broadband. |
| Switching costs (bundles) | 5/10 | Converged TV+internet+mobile creates friction, but DIGI tests this. |
| Regulatory position | 4/10 | State backing protects but limits flexibility. |
| **Overall** | **NARROW** | Infrastructure is the core moat. DIGI threatens pricing but not the physical network advantage. |

**Key nuance vs previous thesis**: The previous thesis said moat is "weakening." I disagree -- DIGI threatens PRICING, not the moat itself. The fiber network is a 30-year asset that DIGI cannot replicate. Proximus's moat is the infrastructure, not the pricing power. Pricing power was never the moat -- it was oligopoly rent. Losing that rent is painful but the underlying infrastructure moat remains intact.

## 4. Financial Analysis

### Historical (from yfinance via previous thesis)
| Year | Revenue | EBITDA | Net Income | FCF |
|------|---------|--------|------------|-----|
| 2021 | EUR 5.54B | EUR 1.82B | EUR 443M | EUR 484M |
| 2022 | EUR 5.85B | EUR 1.81B | EUR 450M | EUR 276M |
| 2023 | EUR 5.99B | EUR 1.77B | EUR 357M | EUR 167M |
| 2024 | EUR 6.38B | EUR 1.96B | EUR 447M | EUR 128M |

### 2025 Guidance (from Proximus IR, Q3 2025)
- Domestic revenue: stable
- Domestic EBITDA: up to +2%
- Group EBITDA: up to +1%
- Capex: ~EUR 1.25B (revised DOWN from ~1.35B)
- Organic FCF: ~EUR 100M (revised UP)
- Net debt/EBITDA: improving to ~2.8x
- **Management confirmed 2024 was PEAK CAPEX**

### FCF Collapse Context
The FCF collapse (EUR 484M -> EUR 128M) is driven ENTIRELY by capex growth (EUR 1.1B -> EUR 1.47B), NOT by EBITDA decline. EBITDA is actually stable to growing. This is the critical distinction between a "value trap" and a "capex cycle opportunity."

### Dividend
- EUR 0.60/share (rebased from EUR 1.20 in 2023)
- Total cost: ~EUR 195M
- Current FCF: ~EUR 100M (not covering dividend)
- BUT: as capex normalizes, FCF expands. At maintenance capex of EUR 700-800M, FCF would be EUR 800-900M -- dividend easily covered 4-5x.

---

## 5. Valuation (Revised)

### Critical Assumption: What is Maintenance Capex?

This is the single most important variable. The entire thesis hinges on it.

| Capex Level | Implied FCF | Fair Value Range |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| EUR 1.2B (current) | EUR 100-200M | EUR 5-8 (value trap) |
| EUR 900M (moderate decline) | EUR 500-600M | EUR 10-14 |
| EUR 700M (full normalization) | EUR 800-900M | EUR 18-23 |

**My estimate**: Maintenance capex for a full-service telecom with fiber network is EUR 750-900M. The fiber build will complete ~2028, but some ongoing expansion + 5G + IT refresh is needed. I use EUR 850M as my central case.

### Method 1: DCF (Central Case)
- EBITDA: EUR 1.9B (flat -- conservative, no growth assumed)
- Normalized capex (post-2028): EUR 850M
- Tax + interest + WC: EUR 300M
- Normalized FCF: EUR 750M
- WACC: 9%, Terminal growth: 1.5%
- 10-year DCF with capex declining from EUR 1.25B (2025) to EUR 850M (2029+)
- **Fair value: ~EUR 14-16/share**

### Method 2: DCF (Pessimistic -- DIGI + Global drag)
- EBITDA declines to EUR 1.7B (-10% from DIGI pricing pressure)
- Capex stays at EUR 950M (slower decline)
- **Fair value: ~EUR 8-10/share**

### Method 3: DDM
- EUR 0.60 dividend, 10% cost of equity, 0-1.5% growth
- **Fair value: EUR 6.00-7.06** (floor valuation, assumes zero FCF expansion)

### Method 4: EV/EBITDA Comparables

| Peer | P/E | Yield | EV/EBITDA (est) |
|------|-----|-------|-----------------|
| Deutsche Telekom | 11.4x | 3.3% | ~7x |
| KPN | 18.7x | 5.3% | ~8x |
| Swisscom | 26.3x | 3.5% | ~11x |
| Telefonica | N/A | 8.8% | ~6x |
| Telia | 31.4x | 5.1% | ~8x |
| **Proximus** | **5.2x** | **7.8%** | **3.1x** |

Proximus trades at a massive discount to every peer. Even applying a 30% "DIGI + small market + leverage" discount to the cheapest peer (Telefonica 6x), implied fair value at 4.2x EBITDA = EUR ~14/share.

### Valuation Summary

| Method | Bear | Base | Bull |
|--------|------|------|------|
| DCF | EUR 8 | EUR 14 | EUR 20+ |
| DDM | EUR 6 | EUR 7 | EUR 7 |
| EV/EBITDA comp | EUR 10 | EUR 14 | EUR 25 |
| **Weighted** | **EUR 8** | **EUR 12** | **EUR 18** |

**At EUR 7.68:**
- Bear case MoS: 4% (insufficient)
- Base case MoS: 36% (exceeds Tier B 25% requirement)
- Bull case MoS: 57%

## 6. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Notes |
|------|------------|--------|-------|
| DIGI disruption compresses ARPU | HIGH (70%) | HIGH | EUR 5/month mobile, EUR 10/month fiber. Will force industry response. |
| Capex does not normalize as expected | MEDIUM (40%) | HIGH | Rural fiber, 5G, IT refresh could keep capex elevated. |
| Global segment continues declining | MEDIUM-HIGH (55%) | MEDIUM | EBITDA dropping to EUR 100-130M. Feb 27 plan critical. |
| Dividend cut | MEDIUM (35%) | MEDIUM | Already rebased. Further cut possible if FCF stays depressed. |
| Regulatory (network sharing JV) | MEDIUM (40%) | MEDIUM | Belgian/EU regulators may impose conditions. |
| State ownership limits value creation | STRUCTURAL | LOW-MED | No LBO, no activist, no aggressive restructuring. |

---

## 7. Quality Score: 4/10 => Tier B (with capex cycle adjustment)

Not Tier A (too many quality issues). Not Tier C (not a turnaround -- business is stable, just capex-heavy). Tier B requires 25% MoS.

---

## 8. Decision: CONDITIONAL BUY

### Recommended Action:
**WAIT until after Feb 27, 2026 strategic plan announcement.** Then:

- If strategic plan confirms capex decline trajectory and credible Global turnaround: **BUY at EUR 7.50-7.70, position 3-4% (~EUR 300-400)**
- If strategic plan disappoints (capex stays elevated, no Global clarity): **AVOID until EUR 5-6 range**

### Why upgrade from AVOID to CONDITIONAL BUY:
1. The EV/EBITDA discount (3.1x vs 6-7x sector) is too extreme to ignore entirely
2. Management confirmed 2024 was peak capex and revised 2025 capex DOWN
3. Even the pessimistic DCF (EUR 8-10) is close to current price, limiting downside
4. 7.8% yield provides income while waiting
5. Feb 27 strategic plan is only 26 days away -- low opportunity cost to wait

### Why not outright BUY today:
1. Bear case MoS is only 4% -- insufficient
2. DIGI impact is genuinely unknown and could be severe
3. Previous thesis correctly identified that dividend is not covered by FCF
4. Feb 27 event could provide much better visibility at similar price

### Sizing rationale (if buying):
- 3% position (EUR 300): lower than standard 4-5% due to narrow moat + DIGI risk + leverage
- Not 5%+ because of quality concerns (Quality Score 4/10)

### Target price: EUR 10-12 (12-18 months)
### Stop-loss thesis: EBITDA declines >10% AND capex does not decline per guidance

## 9. Reconciliation with Previous Thesis (Jan 31)

The previous thesis concluded AVOID with fair value EUR 6.00-7.00. This update arrives at EUR 8-14 range. The difference:

1. **Previous used more conservative capex normalization** -- kept capex near EUR 1.1-1.2B as "new normal." I believe EUR 850M is more realistic once fiber completes.
2. **Previous dismissed EV/EBITDA comparables** as misleading. I agree they are distorted by leverage but the 3.1x vs 6-7x gap is too large to dismiss entirely.
3. **Previous focused more on DIGI threat.** I agree DIGI is real risk but believe it will compress margins 5-15%, not destroy the business.
4. **Both agree**: Feb 27 is the key catalyst. Both agree DDM gives EUR 6-7 as floor.

**Net assessment**: The truth is between the two theses. Previous was too bearish, my initial revised DCF too bullish. Fair value EUR 8-14 with central estimate EUR 12 is where I land.

---

## 10. Autocritique

**Assumptions:**
- Maintenance capex EUR 850M (could be EUR 950M+ if fiber rural build is more expensive)
- EBITDA stays flat at EUR 1.9B (could decline with DIGI)
- DIGI impact is 5-15% on ARPU (could be worse in a small market)

**Biases detected:**
- Anchoring bias: I may be anchoring to the screening data (P/E 5.2, FCF yield 20%) which looks compelling
- Contrarian temptation: wanting to disagree with previous AVOID thesis
- Yield trap: 7.8% yield is seductive

**What Buffett/Klarman would do:**
- Wait for the Feb 27 catalyst -- free option with minimal cost
- Size very small if entering (2-3%)
- Focus on whether DIGI truly disrupts or just takes marginal share
- Would want to see 2-3 quarters of capex decline before committing
