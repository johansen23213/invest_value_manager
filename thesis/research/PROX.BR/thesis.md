# Proximus (PROX.BR) - Investment Thesis
**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Analyst:** Claude Fundamental Analyst
**Decision: AVOID (at current price)**

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Proximus is Belgium's incumbent telecom operator (53% state-owned), trading at EUR 7.68 with optically cheap metrics (P/E 5.2x, EV/EBITDA 4.7x, yield 5.2%). However, deeper analysis reveals this is a **value trap**, not a value opportunity. The low P/E is driven by depressed earnings quality, massive capex cycle (fiber), heavy debt (net debt/EBITDA ~2.8x), declining FCF, and a troubled international segment (Proximus Global). DCF valuation yields EUR 6.43 weighted fair value -- **the stock is overvalued by ~19% vs intrinsic value**. No margin of safety exists for a value fund requiring >25% MoS.

---

## 2. Business Overview

**What Proximus does:**
- **Domestic (~70% revenue):** Fixed/mobile telecom, broadband, TV, ICT services in Belgium. Market leader with ~43% revenue share. #1 in broadband (~45% share), strong in converged bundles.
- **Proximus Global (~30% revenue):** International carrier services (BICS), digital identity (Telesign), CPaaS (Route Mobile). Restructured under single brand Dec 2024.

**Ownership:** Belgian state 53.3%, free float 46.7%. This limits strategic optionality (M&A, delisting, aggressive restructuring).

**Competitive position in Belgium:**
- #1 operator, incumbent advantage in fixed infrastructure
- Fiber rollout: 2.3M homes passed (43% coverage by Q1 2025), EUR 3B total program
- Key competitors: Telenet (#2, ~32% share, owned by Liberty Global), Orange Belgium (#3, ~22.5%, acquired VOO)
- **NEW THREAT: Digi Belgium** entered Dec 2024 with disruptive pricing (EUR 10/month fiber, EUR 5/month mobile) -- this is a material risk to ARPU

## 3. Moat Assessment: NARROW (weakening)

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| Switching costs | Moderate -- converged bundles create stickiness but Digi disrupts this |
| Network infrastructure | Strong -- fiber + mobile network, but Orange/Proximus JV under regulatory scrutiny |
| Scale | Moderate -- #1 in small market (11.5M population) |
| Brand/incumbent | Moderate -- state backing, trusted brand, but commoditizing |
| Regulatory | Mixed -- state ownership protects but limits flexibility |

**Moat trend: Deteriorating.** Digi entry, Orange/VOO consolidation, and regulatory pressure on the Proximus-Orange network sharing JV are all eroding competitive advantages. Morningstar recently downgraded multiple European telecoms' moat ratings.

## 4. Financial Analysis

### Revenue Trend (yfinance)
| Year | Revenue (EUR B) | EBITDA (EUR B) | Net Income (EUR M) | FCF (EUR M) |
|------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 2021 | 5.54 | 1.82 | 443 | 484 |
| 2022 | 5.85 | 1.81 | 450 | 276 |
| 2023 | 5.99 | 1.77 | 357 | 167 |
| 2024 | 6.38 | 1.96 | 447 | 128 |

**Key observations:**
- Revenue growing but driven by Route Mobile consolidation (acquired 2023), not organic
- EBITDA flat to slightly up -- Domestic +1.8% YoY offset by Global decline
- **FCF collapsing:** EUR 484M (2021) -> EUR 128M (2024). Capex eating all cash generation.
- OCF stable ~EUR 1.6B but capex jumped from EUR 1.1B to EUR 1.47B (fiber build)
- **Dividend not covered by FCF:** Paid EUR 360M dividends on EUR 128M FCF in 2024

### Debt Profile
- Net financial debt (ex-leases): EUR 3,593M (Q3 2025)
- Net debt/EBITDA: ~2.8x (improved from 3.0x)
- Rating: BBB+ (S&P), A2 (Moody's) -- investment grade
- Recent bond: EUR 750M at 3.75% maturing 2035 (April 2025)
- Debt well-laddered, no near-term cliff
- BUT: leverage is high for a company with declining FCF

### Dividend Sustainability
- EUR 0.60/share guided for 2025 (two tranches of EUR 0.30)
- Total cost: ~EUR 195M
- Organic FCF guided: ~EUR 100M
- **Dividend payout ratio >100% of FCF.** Funded partially by debt. Unsustainable long-term unless capex normalizes.

## 5. Valuation

### Method 1: DCF (3 scenarios, 10-year horizon)

Key assumption: capex peak ends 2025-2026, FCF normalizes toward EUR 400-500M as fiber build completes.

| Scenario | Weight | WACC | Terminal g | Fair Value |
|----------|--------|------|-----------|------------|
| Conservative | 30% | 9.0% | 1.5% | EUR 2.50 |
| Base case | 50% | 8.5% | 2.0% | EUR 6.63 |
| Optimistic | 20% | 8.0% | 2.0% | EUR 11.83 |
| **Weighted** | | | | **EUR 6.43** |

The DCF is highly sensitive to the capex normalization timeline. If fiber build extends or Global deteriorates further, the conservative scenario dominates.

### Method 2: EV/EBITDA Comparables

| Peer | EV/EBITDA |
|------|-----------|
| KPN | 8.6x |
| Swisscom | 11.7x |
| Telia | 8.6x |
| Telefonica | 6.5x |
| Orange | 6.8x |
| Deutsche Telekom | 7.3x |
| **Peer median** | **7.9x** |
| **Proximus** | **4.7x** |

Applying a justified discount (leverage, Global issues, Digi threat, small market): 5.5-6.5x range -> EUR 22-28/share implied.

**BUT this is misleading.** The EV/EBITDA comparables produce inflated equity values because Proximus has disproportionately high debt relative to its market cap. At 4.7x EV/EBITDA, the market is saying the EBITDA quality is poor (and it is -- high capex, declining Global segment, dividend not covered).

### Method 3: Dividend Discount Model

| Growth | Fair Value |
|--------|-----------|
| 0.0% | EUR 6.00 |
| 1.0% | EUR 6.67 |
| 1.5% | EUR 7.06 |

At 10% cost of equity and current EUR 0.60 dividend, DDM gives EUR 6.00-7.06.

### Valuation Summary

| Method | Fair Value Range |
|--------|-----------------|
| DCF (weighted) | EUR 6.43 |
| DDM | EUR 6.00 - 7.06 |
| EV/EBITDA (discounted) | Misleading due to leverage |
| **Consensus** | **EUR 6.00 - 7.00** |

**Current price EUR 7.68 is ABOVE fair value.** No margin of safety.

Morningstar fair value estimate: EUR 8.60 (they are more optimistic on Global turnaround).

## 6. Risk Assessment

| # | Risk | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation |
|---|------|------------|--------|-------|------------|
| 1 | **Digi disruption** -- aggressive pricing compresses ARPU across Belgian market | HIGH (75%) | HIGH | 5.6 | No clear mitigation; structural market change |
| 2 | **Proximus Global fails to recover** -- EBITDA dropping to EUR 100-130M in 2026, growth inflection delayed beyond 2027 | MEDIUM-HIGH (60%) | HIGH | 4.8 | New strategic plan Feb 27, 2026 |
| 3 | **Dividend cut** -- FCF doesn't cover dividend, leverage constrains payout | MEDIUM (50%) | MEDIUM | 3.0 | Capex normalization post-fiber could help |
| 4 | **Fiber overbuild / low take-up** -- EUR 3B invested but insufficient monetization | MEDIUM (40%) | HIGH | 3.2 | 43% coverage achieved, take-up data pending |
| 5 | **Regulatory risk** -- Proximus-Orange network JV blocked or restricted by competition authority | MEDIUM (45%) | MEDIUM | 2.7 | Can operate independently |
| 6 | **Correlation with DTE.DE** -- adding another European telecom to portfolio increases sector concentration | LOW-MEDIUM (30%) | LOW | 0.9 | Different geographies, but same macro drivers |

---

## 7. Correlation with Existing Portfolio (DTE.DE)

| Factor | DTE.DE | PROX.BR |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Market cap | EUR 140B | EUR 2.5B |
| Primary market | US (T-Mobile) | Belgium |
| Growth profile | Growing (T-Mobile US) | Stagnant/declining |
| FCF trend | Strong, improving | Collapsing |
| Leverage | Managed, deleveraging | High, not deleveraging |
| Moat | Wide (T-Mobile US dominance) | Narrow, weakening |

**Correlation is moderate.** Both are European telecoms exposed to same rate environment and sector sentiment. However, DTE is fundamentally superior (T-Mobile US growth engine). Adding PROX.BR would increase telecom sector weight without diversification benefit.

---

## 8. Investment Decision: AVOID

### Why AVOID (not BUY despite optically cheap metrics):

1. **No margin of safety.** Fair value EUR 6.00-7.00 vs price EUR 7.68. The stock is 10-28% OVERVALUED on DCF and DDM.
2. **FCF destruction.** From EUR 484M to EUR 128M in 3 years. Dividend not covered. This is not a "cheap cash cow."
3. **Digi disruption is real.** EUR 10/month fiber and EUR 5/month mobile in a previously cozy 3-player market. This will compress margins across the industry.
4. **Global segment is a drag.** EBITDA declining -10% YoY, heading to EUR 100-130M in 2026. The Route Mobile acquisition premium has yet to show returns.
5. **Leverage limits flexibility.** Net debt/EBITDA 2.8x with declining FCF means limited capacity for dividends, buybacks, or strategic moves.
6. **State ownership (53%) limits value creation.** No activist pressure, no LBO, no delisting, employment constraints.
7. **Better alternatives exist.** DTE.DE already in portfolio offers superior telecom exposure. Cash should be deployed in opportunities with genuine >25% MoS.

### What would change my mind:
- Price below EUR 5.00 (approaching conservative DCF)
- Capex normalization to <EUR 1.1B demonstrating FCF recovery toward EUR 400M+
- Strategic plan (Feb 27, 2026) showing credible Global turnaround
- Digi's Belgian operations failing/exiting

### Catalyst calendar:
- **Feb 27, 2026**: New strategic plan + full-year 2025 results -- KEY EVENT
- Q1 2026 results: first read on 2026 trajectory
- Digi Belgium subscriber data: competitive impact visibility

---

## 9. Autocritique

**Assumptions made:**
- Capex normalization from EUR 1.45B to EUR 1.1-1.2B post-fiber (management has not confirmed timeline)
- Net debt ex-leases of EUR 3,593M (Q3 2025 reported, used as-is)
- Digi will maintain aggressive pricing (may moderate)

**Biases checked:**
- Contrarian temptation: "it's so cheap it must be good" -- NO, cheap for a reason
- Yield trap: 5.2% yield is attractive but not sustainable from FCF
- Confirmation bias: I actively sought bull case (Global recovery, fiber monetization) but data doesn't support it yet

**Evidence potentially ignored:**
- EV/EBITDA gap vs peers could close (mean reversion argument)
- Fiber asset has real long-term value once capex normalizes
- Feb 27 strategic plan could be a positive catalyst

**Verdict:** The honest assessment is that Proximus is a capex-heavy, leveraged incumbent in a commoditizing market facing a new disruptor, with declining FCF and a dividend it cannot afford. The optically low P/E of 5.2x is a mirage created by one-time factors. AVOID.
