# Diageo PLC (DGE.L) - Investment Thesis

**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Analyst:** Fundamental Analyst Agent
**Status:** CONDITIONAL BUY - Wait for earnings (25-Feb-2026)

---

## Executive Summary

Diageo is the world's largest spirits company trading at a historically depressed valuation (fwd P/E ~13x vs 5yr avg 27x) after a 29% decline from 52-week highs. The business has a wide moat built on iconic brands, global distribution scale, and premiumization tailwinds. However, elevated leverage (3.4x net debt/EBITDA), a ~100% payout ratio on trailing earnings, and near-zero organic growth create real risks that justify a discount to historical multiples.

**Verdict:** At 1,679 GBp, DCF base case suggests ~26% upside to fair value (2,120 GBp). This exceeds the 15% Tier A threshold for wide-moat defensives. However, the Feb 25 earnings report is a critical catalyst -- payout sustainability and deleveraging trajectory will determine whether the thesis holds. Recommend waiting for earnings confirmation before entering.

## Business Model

Diageo manufactures, markets, and distributes premium spirits and beer globally. Revenue is ~75% spirits (scotch, vodka, gin, tequila, rum) and ~25% beer (Guinness). Operations span ~180 countries with a portfolio of 200+ brands across all price tiers.

**Revenue by region (approx):** North America ~35%, Europe/Turkey ~20%, Africa ~15%, Asia Pacific ~15%, Latin America ~15%.

**Key economics:**
- Capital-light manufacturing (distillation/aging) with high gross margins (~60%)
- Brands appreciate with age and marketing investment (unlike physical assets)
- Premiumization trend: premium-and-above grew from 26% to 35% of category in last decade
- Scotch requires years of aging = natural barrier to entry and working capital commitment

---

## Moat Assessment: WIDE (8/10 confidence)

### 1. Brand Power (PRIMARY MOAT)
- 13 billion-dollar brands: Johnnie Walker, Guinness, Smirnoff, Tanqueray, Captain Morgan, Baileys, Don Julio, etc.
- Consumer loyalty in spirits is extremely sticky -- brand switching is low
- Premiumization trend favors established heritage brands over newcomers

### 2. Scale & Distribution
- #1 spirits company globally, 1.5x the size of nearest competitor (Pernod Ricard)
- 2x larger than #2 in the US (largest market)
- Distribution network across 180 countries is nearly impossible to replicate
- Bigger than 4 of top 10 competitors combined

### 3. Regulatory Barriers
- Alcohol regulation creates barriers to entry in most markets
- Age-statement scotch (10yr, 12yr, 18yr) = natural time barrier
- Licensing requirements in distribution

### 4. Pricing Power
- Premium spirits are relatively price-inelastic
- Premiumization allows mix improvement without volume growth
- Demonstrated ability to pass through inflation (price/mix +0.8% in FY25)

### Moat Risks
- Gen Z drinking less alcohol (structural long-term risk)
- Cannabis/alternatives emerging in some markets
- Private label penetration low but possible at value end

**Moat verdict:** Wide moat. The brand portfolio + global distribution is one of the strongest in consumer staples. The moat is NOT eroding, but growth within the moat is slowing.

## Financial Analysis

### Profitability
| Year | Revenue ($B) | Op Profit ($B) | Op Margin | ROE |
|------|-------------|----------------|-----------|-----|
| FY22 | 17.1 | 4.4 | 25.7% | ~40% |
| FY23 | 20.2 | 5.6 | 27.7% | ~38% |
| FY24 | 20.3 | 6.0 | 29.6% | ~35% |
| FY25 | 20.2 | 4.3 | 21.4% | ~21% |

FY25 operating profit decline of 28% was driven by exceptional items (impairments, restructuring). Underlying (organic) op profit declined only 1%. This is a critical distinction -- the earnings power is closer to $5.5-6.0B operating profit on a normalized basis.

### Free Cash Flow
- FY25 FCF: $2.7B (up from $2.6B in FY24)
- FY26 guidance: ~$3.0B FCF
- FCF is resilient even as reported profits declined -- good sign for cash generation quality
- Capex declining from $1.5B to $1.2-1.3B in FY26

### Balance Sheet -- KEY CONCERN
- Net debt: $21.9B (3.4x EBITDA)
- Target: 2.5-3.0x by FY28
- Total liabilities: $36.1B vs equity $13.2B (D/E ~2.7x)
- This is the weakest aspect of the investment case
- Deleveraging requires: profit growth + capex discipline + potential disposals
- Interest costs eat into FCF available for dividends

### Dividend Sustainability
- FY25 dividend: 103.48 cents/share (+5% YoY)
- EPS (basic): 105.9 cents → payout ratio ~98% on reported earnings
- EPS (adj, ex-exceptionals): 164.2 cents → payout ratio ~63% on adjusted
- On adjusted earnings, dividend is well covered
- 25 consecutive years of dividend payments, never cut
- But: if adjusted earnings don't recover, the payout becomes unsustainable
- **FY26 guidance of mid-single-digit organic op profit growth should improve coverage**

## Valuation

### Method 1: DCF (via dcf_calculator.py --scenarios)

| Scenario | Fair Value (GBp) | Margin of Safety |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Bear | 1,686 | +0.4% (no margin) |
| Base | 2,120 | +26.3% |
| Bull | 2,735 | +63.0% |

Base case assumptions: 5% FCF growth, 2.5% terminal, 9% WACC.

**DCF assessment:** Base case offers 26% MoS, well above 15% Tier A threshold. Bear case essentially at current price, meaning downside is limited if growth stalls.

### Method 2: Earnings Multiple Valuation

**On trailing P/E (22.1x):** Not useful -- distorted by exceptional charges.

**On forward P/E (~13x):**
- Forward EPS implies ~129 GBp per share
- At 15x multiple (conservative for wide-moat staple): 129 x 15 = 1,935 GBp → 15% upside
- At 18x multiple (fair for quality compounder): 129 x 18 = 2,322 GBp → 38% upside
- At 20x multiple (10yr average): 129 x 20 = 2,580 GBp → 54% upside
- Average analyst target: 2,197 GBp → 31% upside

**Earnings multiple assessment:** Even at a conservative 15x forward earnings (significant discount to 5yr avg of 27x), there is 15% upside. At 18x (reasonable for this quality), 38% upside.

### Method 3: Yield-Based Valuation
- Current yield: 4.8%
- 10yr average yield: ~2.5%
- If yield normalizes to 3.5% (still above historical): implied price = 1,679 x (4.8/3.5) = 2,302 GBp → 37% upside
- Market is pricing in either a dividend cut or permanently impaired growth

### Valuation Summary
| Method | Fair Value (GBp) | MoS |
|--------|-----------------|-----|
| DCF Base | 2,120 | 26% |
| DCF Bear | 1,686 | 0% |
| Fwd P/E 18x | 2,322 | 38% |
| Fwd P/E 15x | 1,935 | 15% |
| Yield normalization | 2,302 | 37% |
| Analyst consensus | 2,197 | 31% |

**Central estimate: ~2,100-2,200 GBp (25-31% MoS)**

## Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISKS
1. **Leverage (3.4x EBITDA)** -- Highest among consumer staple peers. Limits buybacks, constrains dividend growth, increases vulnerability to downturn. Target 2.5-3.0x by FY28 requires execution.
2. **Payout ratio on trailing earnings (~98%)** -- If adjusted earnings don't recover to normalized levels, dividend cut becomes real possibility. A dividend cut would trigger significant selling.
3. **US tariffs** -- ~$150M annual impact from UK/EU spirits tariffs. Uncertain duration.
4. **Organic growth near zero** -- FY25 organic net sales +1.7%, FY26 guided similar. For a P/E of 13x to re-rate, growth needs to inflect.

### MEDIUM RISKS
5. **Gen Z alcohol consumption decline** -- Structural but very slow-moving. 600M new legal-age consumers by 2035 partially offsets.
6. **Moat Hennessy associate income** -- Significant decline in FY25, driven by cognac weakness. Partially outside Diageo's control.
7. **Currency exposure** -- Reports in USD but listed in GBP. Major operations in many currencies.
8. **Competition from tequila/agave newcomers** -- Celebrity-backed brands taking share in fastest-growing category, though Don Julio remains strong.

### LOW RISKS
9. **Regulatory risk** -- Alcohol advertising restrictions could tighten. Slow-moving.
10. **Inventory/aging risk** -- Scotch requires years of aging; demand forecasting errors are costly.

## Quality Score (Tier Assessment)

| # | Criterion | Score | Notes |
|---|-----------|-------|-------|
| 1 | ROE >15% (5yr) | 1/1 | 5yr avg ~34%, declining but still >15% |
| 2 | FCF positive 5yr | 1/1 | Consistently positive |
| 3 | Debt/Equity <1.0 | 0/1 | **FAIL** -- D/E ~2.7x, Net Debt/EBITDA 3.4x |
| 4 | 10+ yr dividend streak | 1/1 | 25 years unbroken |
| 5 | Wide moat | 1/1 | Clear wide moat |
| 6 | Revenue stability | 1/1 | Max drawdown ~5% in recessions |
| 7 | Management quality | 0.5/1 | Adequate but leverage buildup is concerning |
| 8 | Analyst coverage >10 | 1/1 | 21+ analysts |
| 9 | Market cap >EUR 10B | 1/1 | ~EUR 43B |
| 10 | Defensive sector | 1/1 | Consumer staples |

**Quality Score: 7.5/10 → Tier A (15% MoS required)**

The debt level is the main quality detractor. Without it, this would score 8.5+/10. The deleveraging trajectory is therefore the key variable to monitor.

## Autocritica (Pre-Recommendation)

- **Assumptions:** I assume normalized earnings recover to ~165 cents EPS. If FY25 exceptionals recur, the thesis weakens.
- **Biases detected:** Diageo is a well-known name (popularity bias check: justified here because it genuinely has the widest moat in spirits).
- **Evidence ignored:** Gen Z alcohol trend could be more severe than I model. I may be anchoring to historical premiums.
- **Validation:** DCF and earnings multiple methods converge on ~2,100-2,200 GBp. Analyst consensus at 2,197 GBp aligns. Convergence adds confidence.
- **Alternatives considered:** Pernod Ricard (RI.PA) trades at similar discount. Could be worth comparing.

## Decision

### CONDITIONAL BUY

**Target entry:** 1,600-1,700 GBp (current range is acceptable)
**Fair value estimate:** 2,100-2,200 GBp
**Margin of Safety:** 25-31% (exceeds 15% Tier A threshold)
**Position size:** 4-5% (moderate -- leverage risk warrants smaller than max)

### Conditions (must ALL be met):
1. **Feb 25 earnings must confirm:**
   - Adjusted EPS trajectory supports dividend coverage (payout <75% on adjusted)
   - No dividend cut announced
   - Leverage trajectory on track (3.4x or improving)
   - Organic growth at least flat
2. **Sector allocation check:** With IMB.L and TATE.L, adding DGE.L increases consumer staples exposure. Must verify <25% sector limit.

### If conditions met:
- Enter at market price post-earnings (assuming no gap up >10%)
- Set stop-loss mental level at 1,400 GBp (thesis invalidation: dividend cut or leverage >4x)
- Target: hold for 2-3 years for re-rating + dividend collection

### Price monitor:
- Alert if price drops below 1,500 GBp (increase position sizing analysis)
- Alert if price rises above 1,900 GBp pre-earnings (reduced MoS, reconsider entry)

## Comparables Context

| Company | Fwd P/E | Yield | Net Debt/EBITDA | Moat |
|---------|---------|-------|-----------------|------|
| Diageo (DGE.L) | ~13x | 4.8% | 3.4x | Wide |
| Pernod Ricard (RI.PA) | ~14x | 4.2% | 3.0x | Wide |
| Remy Cointreau | ~25x | 3.0% | 2.5x | Narrow |
| Brown-Forman | ~28x | 2.0% | 1.5x | Wide |

Diageo is the cheapest of the wide-moat spirit names on forward P/E. Brown-Forman (Jack Daniel's) at 28x fwd shows what premium the market assigns to lower leverage and US-centric operations.
