# Counter-Analysis: DOM.L (Domino's Pizza Group PLC)

## Fecha: 2026-02-09

---

## CRITICAL ALERT

The thesis's expected Fair Value of 294p is overstated by approximately 20-25%. Independent analysis from three sources (risk-identifier, valuation-specialist, and this devil's advocate) converges on a fair value range of 197-269p, with the bear case (177-190p) dangerously close to the current price of 191p. At current price, the real Margin of Safety is 3-29%, NOT the 37% claimed by the thesis. The position is not a strong buy -- it is at best a speculative hold with asymmetric downside risk ahead of FY25 results on March 5.

---

## Resumen Ejecutivo

The DOM.L bull thesis rests on 10 claims that together paint a picture of a dominant, asset-light franchise with a wide moat, cheap valuation, and imminent recovery. After independent adversarial research including review of 3 independent agent reports, web research across 25+ sources, and cross-referencing with actual financial data, I find that 4 of the 10 claims are materially wrong, 4 are partially right but overstated, and only 2 hold up to scrutiny. The thesis survives as a speculative hold but NOT as a high-conviction position. The claimed 37% MoS is a fiction -- real MoS is 3-29% depending on methodology, with the bear case essentially at current price.

## The 10 Claims: Counter-Arguments

### CLAIM 1: "Master franchise = legal monopoly with 54% UK pizza delivery share"

**Counter-Score: STRONG COUNTER (3/3)**

The 54% figure is narrowly defined to mean branded pizza delivery/takeaway only. In the broader food delivery market where consumers actually make decisions, Domino's has only 7.2% of total UK takeaway share (H1 2025 data) and 11.0% of foodservice brand share.

The competitive landscape has fundamentally shifted. Uber Eats now holds 27.2% of ALL UK delivery occasions, Just Eat 25.2%, and Deliveroo 16.2%. These platforms make every restaurant a pizza competitor with "just a few taps." When a consumer opens Uber Eats, they see not just Pizza Hut and Papa John's but hundreds of independent pizzerias, ghost kitchens, and Italian restaurants -- all at the same delivery cost.

Pizza delivery as a UK QSR category is the ONLY segment in decline (-0.8% in 2025, per IBIS World). The pizza delivery/takeaway market has declined at a -1.4% CAGR between 2019 and 2024. Having 54% of a shrinking market is fundamentally different from having 54% of a growing one.

Furthermore, Domino's itself now uses Just Eat and Uber Eats for demand acquisition -- meaning it is PAYING commissions to the very platforms that promote its competitors. 24% of Domino's orders already flow through aggregators where Domino's has less pricing power and data ownership.

### CLAIM 2: "Asset-light, high FCF" - GBP 87M FCF, 12% FCF yield

**Counter-Score: MODERATE COUNTER (2/3)**

The GBP 87M FCF figure is from FY24 and is BACKWARD-LOOKING. H1 2025 underlying free cash flow was only GBP 28.7M, on an EBITDA that fell 7.4% to GBP 63.9M. If H2 follows a similar trajectory (even with seasonal uplift), FY25 FCF is likely GBP 70-80M, not GBP 87M.

The "asset-light" claim ignores IFRS 16 lease liabilities. yfinance reports total debt (including leases) of GBP 547M, giving leverage of approximately 4.2x on guided FY25 EBITDA of GBP 130-140M. The quality scorer calculated leverage at 4.6x and awarded 0 points for the leverage component.

The FCF yield of 12% uses trailing FY24 data and current depressed market cap. On forward FCF (GBP 70-80M), the yield drops to 9.6-11.0%. Still decent, but the direction is DOWN, not stable.

Additionally, DPG is now spending GBP 7-9M/year in franchisee profitability support through the PGF framework. This is a recurring margin transfer that reduces effective DPG-level FCF margins.

The ROIC claim of "~30%" is mathematically meaningless on negative equity. The quality scorer's ROIC spread was 6.4pp -- decent but far from the 21.5pp spread the thesis claims. The valuation specialist confirmed this.

**Evidence sources:** DPG H1 2025 interim results, quality_scorer.py output, valuation_report.md, risk_assessment.md.

### CLAIM 3: "CEO departure doesn't matter" - franchise runs itself

**Counter-Score: STRONG COUNTER (3/3)**

This is the thesis's weakest claim. The evidence is overwhelming that the CEO departure DOES matter:

1. **Forced exit, not planned succession.** Andrew Rennie left "by mutual agreement with immediate effect" after underlying profits dropped 15% in H1 2025 and the stock hit its worst performance in company history (-47% in 2025). Bloomberg described it as "unexpected."

2. **2.5-month vacuum and counting.** As of February 9, 2026, no permanent CEO has been appointed. The board has "commenced a search process" with NO timeline. Typical CEO searches take 6-12 months. There is a realistic scenario where DPG has no permanent CEO for 12+ months.

3. **Dual leadership vacuum.** The CFO position is also in transition -- Andy Andrea starts March 16, 2026, which is 11 DAYS AFTER FY25 results are released on March 5. The company will present its most important results with an interim CEO and an outgoing finance team. This is material governance risk.

4. **Strategy in limbo.** The company explicitly stated it "does not envisage pursuing a second brand acquisition until the new CEO is in place." CHICK'N'DIP (fried chicken trial in 187 stores) was Rennie's initiative -- now orphaned. The entire growth-beyond-pizza strategy is paused.

5. **Deutsche Bank downgraded specifically on this.** They moved from Buy to Hold, cutting target from 309p to 235p, citing the "materially changed" investment case.

6. **The franchise model runs OPERATIONS, not STRATEGY.** Stores can deliver pizza without a CEO. But capital allocation decisions, store expansion targets, menu innovation, brand acquisitions, and the new PGF framework all require strategic leadership. These are on hold.

The thesis assigns only 25% probability to "CEO vacuum prolongs." Given 2.5 months have already passed with no timeline, this should be 50-60%.

### CLAIM 4: "UK consumer recovering" - rate cuts coming H2 2026

**Counter-Score: STRONG COUNTER (3/3)**

Every authoritative macro source contradicts the recovery narrative:

- **KPMG (Dec 2025):** UK economy expected to SLOW to 1.0% in 2026 from 1.4% in 2025
- **Unemployment:** Forecast to RISE to 5.2% in 2026
- **GfK Consumer Confidence:** -16 in January 2026 (weak)
- **Deloitte Consumer Tracker:** Fell to -11.1% in Q4 2025, lowest in 2 years
- **Spending intentions:** 27% plan to spend LESS in 2026 vs only 13% MORE; 49% cutting discretionary spend
- **BMI/Fitch:** "Weak spending outlook" for UK 2026
- **Wage growth:** Expected to slow to 3% by mid-2026

UK Bank of England rates are at 4.5%. The thesis claims "rate cuts coming H2 2026" but rate cuts are increasingly uncertain. The world/current_view.md shows BCE at 2.0% pause and Fed at 3.5-3.75%. UK rates are HIGHER than both and have NOT been cut yet. Even if rate cuts arrive in H2 2026, the transmission to consumer spending takes 6-12 additional months.

The thesis treats consumer recovery as the base case (50% probability). The data suggests consumer weakness persisting through 2026 is the more likely scenario (60-65% probability).

### CLAIM 5: "FY25 is trough" - EBITDA 130-140M then recovery

**Counter-Score: STRONG COUNTER (3/3)**

The "trough" narrative requires evidence that conditions are at their worst and improving. The evidence shows they may be WORSENING:

1. **Guidance already cut once.** Initial FY25 EBITDA consensus was GBP 146.4M. Cut to GBP 130-140M in August 2025 -- a 10% downward revision. There is no guarantee it won't be cut again.

2. **H1 2025 showed margin compression.** EBITDA fell 7.4% to GBP 63.9M despite revenue growing 1.4%. This means margins are compressing, not just revenue softening.

3. **Employment costs are STRUCTURAL headwinds.** National Living Wage increased 10% in April 2024. Employer NI increased April 2025. NLW will rise a further 4.1% in April 2026. UK Hospitality estimates GBP 1.4 BILLION in additional sector costs. These costs do not reverse.

4. **Store openings collapsed.** From 54 in FY24 to "mid-twenties" guided for FY25 (only 11 in H1). This signals franchisee reluctance to invest. If franchisees are pulling back, the "recovery" requires organic SSS growth, which has been running at -0.1% to +1.0%.

5. **The CEO himself said the market is "nearing saturation."** Andrew Rennie stated there was no "massive growth" left in UK pizza delivery. This admission from the company's own CEO directly contradicts the "trough then recovery" narrative.

6. **Q3 2025 showed orders DECLINING.** Total orders fell 1.5% in Q3 despite sales up 2.1%. This means pricing is compensating for volume declines -- a pattern that has limits.

7. **LFL volumes have declined cumulatively 7% since 2019.** Pricing has driven system sales up 26% since 2019, but pricing power is not infinite, especially with 49% of consumers cutting discretionary spend.

The more honest characterization is that FY25 may represent a NEW NORMAL of GBP 130-140M EBITDA, not a temporary dip.

**Evidence sources:** DPG H1 2025 results, Q3 2025 trading statement, FT interview with Rennie, Seeking Alpha analysis, ainvest analysis.

### CLAIM 6: "Cheap at 9.2x P/E" - value with growth

**Counter-Score: MODERATE COUNTER (2/3)**

The 9.2x P/E (now 9.5x at 191p) looks cheap vs global franchise peers (DPZ 24x, YUM 22x, MCD 25x). But there are valid reasons for the discount:

1. **Single geography.** DOM.L operates ONLY in UK and Ireland. Global franchisors diversify across 100+ countries. This alone warrants a 30-50% multiple discount.

2. **Small cap.** GBP 730M market cap with only 9 analysts covering. There is a real illiquidity/size discount.

3. **Declining metrics.** EBITDA declined FY24-to-FY25. P/E looks cheap on PEAK earnings, which may have occurred in FY23.

4. **No permanent CEO.** An executive vacuum for a company in strategic transition warrants a governance discount.

5. **Negative equity.** Makes P/E the only usable ratio, which flatters the valuation. EV/EBITDA of 6.9x looks cheap until you consider it includes GBP 280M net debt that is RISING.

However, even the bear case analysis shows DOM.L deserves more than the current multiple at 6.9x EV/EBITDA, which implies a 60% discount to global franchise peers and 45% discount to Greggs (UK domestic comparable). The market may be somewhat overcorrecting. This is why the counter is MODERATE, not STRONG.

**Evidence sources:** Valuation_report.md, comparable company analysis, Yahoo Finance.

### CLAIM 7: "Pizza = affordable luxury, resilient"

**Counter-Score: MODERATE COUNTER (2/3)**

Pizza IS relatively cheap vs dining out. But "affordable luxury" positioning is under attack from BOTH sides:

**From below:** Supermarket chilled pizza value sales grew 4.8%. IGD projects a 0.5pp shift from away-from-home to retail spending. A Domino's pizza costs GBP 15-20; a supermarket Chicago Town pizza costs GBP 3-4. When 49% of consumers are cutting discretionary spend, the cheapest option wins.

**From above:** Aggregator platforms make restaurant-quality meals available at competitive prices. A consumer who would have ordered Domino's can now order from their favorite Italian restaurant on Uber Eats for a similar price.

**Volume evidence contradicts "resilience":** Like-for-like order volumes have declined cumulatively 7% since 2019. Q3 2025 total orders fell 1.5%. This is not a picture of demand resilience -- it is a picture of a convenience product losing occasions to cheaper (supermarket) and more varied (aggregators) alternatives.

The "affordable luxury" claim works in a mild downturn. In a prolonged squeeze with rising unemployment (5.2% forecast) and falling confidence, even "affordable" luxuries get cut.

**Evidence sources:** The Grocer, IGD retail forecasts, KPMG consumer research.

---

### CLAIM 8: "Competitors closing, DOM gaining share"

**Counter-Score: WEAK COUNTER (1/3)**

This is ACTUALLY TRUE for traditional competitors. Domino's gained +560bps in UK pizza takeaway share and +20bps in total UK takeaway share in H1 2025. Papa John's and Pizza Hut are struggling (Pizza Hut H1 profit fell 15%). Independent pizza shops are closing.

However, the counter-argument is about the RELEVANCE of this metric. Gaining share in pizza delivery is like gaining share in DVD rentals in 2010. The relevant competitive arena is shifting to food delivery broadly, where Domino's is a 7-11% player, not a 54% dominant.

Also, Domino's own store opening rate collapsed from 54 (FY24) to mid-twenties (FY25), with only 11 in H1. If Domino's itself is slowing expansion, the "gaining share" narrative weakens.

This is the thesis's strongest claim, which is why the counter is WEAK.

**Evidence sources:** DPG H1 2025 data, The Grocer.

### CLAIM 9: "Franchisee economics strong" - 14% margin, 45-50% ROI

**Counter-Score: MODERATE COUNTER (2/3)**

The GBP 168K average store profit and 45-50% ROI are FY24 BACKWARD-LOOKING figures calculated BEFORE:

1. **April 2024:** NLW increased 10% (GBP 11.44 to GBP 12.21/hr)
2. **April 2025:** Employer NI increase (described as adding "millions" by CEO Rennie)
3. **April 2026:** NLW rising further 4.1% to GBP 12.71/hr; youth rates up 8.5%

UK Hospitality estimates GBP 1.4 BILLION in additional costs for the hospitality sector from these combined hits.

The evidence that franchisees are ALREADY feeling the squeeze:

- Store openings collapsed from 54 to mid-twenties. If economics were so strong (45-50% ROI), franchisees would be opening MORE stores, not fewer.
- DPG launched a GBP 7-9M/year PGF (Profitability and Growth Framework) to subsidize franchisee profitability. You don't subsidize franchisees if their economics are genuinely strong.
- H1 2025 revenue grew only 1.4% while costs escalated -- franchisees absorb the gap.
- The estate is "top heavy" with the big 3 franchisees controlling approximately 50% of stores. Smaller franchisees are more vulnerable to cost squeezes.

The forward-looking picture for franchisee economics is materially worse than the backward-looking data the thesis cites.

**Evidence sources:** UK Government NLW data, UK Hospitality, DPG PGF announcement, ainvest analysis, Johan Lunau analysis.

### CLAIM 10: "Negative equity is feature not bug" from buybacks

**Counter-Score: MODERATE COUNTER (2/3)**

The "buybacks reduce share count, negative equity is a feature" argument works when:
- EBITDA is growing (it is not -- FY25 declined)
- FCF comfortably covers buybacks AND dividends AND debt service (it is stretched)
- The company is buying back shares at attractive prices (buying at 280p when FV may be 197-269p is questionable)

Recent evidence undermines the thesis:

1. **September 2025:** DPG launched a GBP 20M buyback program at the SAME TIME as guiding net debt HIGHER (GBP 280-300M vs previous GBP 260-280M). Buying back shares while net debt is rising is financially imprudent for a company with declining EBITDA.

2. **Negative equity means no equity cushion.** If EBITDA deteriorates further and the company needs to refinance debt, negative equity makes it harder. The GBP 300M RCF refinanced to 2030 provides liquidity but does not eliminate the structural concern.

3. **GBP 460M distributed in buybacks and dividends over 4 years while equity went MORE negative.** This is value redistribution during a period when the business needed reinvestment (new store formats, technology, chicken concept).

4. **Dividend sustainability.** Dividend grew 2.9% in H1 2025 while EPS fell 14.3%. Payout ratio is rising. A dividend cut (kill condition in thesis) becomes more probable if EBITDA stays at GBP 130-140M.

For franchise models like DPZ US (global, diversified, growing EBITDA), negative equity from buybacks is indeed defensible. For DOM.L (single market, saturating, declining EBITDA), it introduces real financial fragility.

## Additional Risks NOT in Thesis

| # | Risk | Severity | Notes |
|---|------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Estate is "top heavy" -- Big 3 franchisees control ~50% of stores | HIGH | Key-man risk. If a major franchisee exits, disruption would be massive. DPG would need to buy back stores at 8x+ EBITDA. |
| 2 | DoorDash/Deliveroo merger creates mega-aggregator in UK | HIGH | DoorDash closed USD 3.86B acquisition of Deliveroo, creating a combined entity with deeper pockets and more aggressive pizza competition. |
| 3 | Supermarket chilled pizza growing 4.8% per year | MEDIUM | Cannibalizes "affordable meal" occasions. IGD projects structural shift from away-from-home to retail food. |
| 4 | Quality Scorer gives 0/40 for financial quality leverage | HIGH | Thesis claims "manageable" leverage but quantitative tool strongly disagrees. |
| 5 | LFL order volumes -7% cumulative since 2019 | HIGH | The pricing lever is masking genuine demand erosion. Volume declines eventually compress revenue. |
| 6 | PGF framework costs DPG GBP 7-9M/year in franchisee subsidies | MEDIUM | Not mentioned in thesis. Reduces effective DPG margins by ~1pp. |
| 7 | No ESG/sustainability narrative | LOW | Increasingly relevant for institutional capital allocation. |

## Overall Assessment

### Is the 290p FV realistic?

**NO.** The thesis FV of 290p (base) requires:
- Consumer recovery in H2 2026 (data contradicts)
- 3% revenue growth from Year 1 (actual LFL is 0-1%)
- WACC of 8.5% (too low for no-CEO small cap in consumer discretionary)
- Net debt of GBP 280M (rising, not stable)

Three independent sources converge on significantly lower fair values:
- **Valuation specialist:** 269p expected (263p base) -- delta -8.5%
- **Risk-identifier:** 225-240p risk-adjusted -- delta -18% to -22%
- **Devil's advocate (this analysis):** 197p ex-IFRS 16 -- delta -33%

Weighted average across the three independent assessments: approximately 230-245p.

### What is the bear case FV?

Three independent bear estimates:
- Valuation specialist: 184p
- Risk-identifier: 200-220p (risk-adjusted bear)
- Devil's advocate: 142p (IFRS 16-inclusive) to 189p (ex-IFRS 16)

**Central bear estimate: 180-190p** -- essentially AT current price.

### What would make me SHORT this stock?

1. FY25 results (March 5) show EBITDA below GBP 128M (below guided floor)
2. No CEO appointment by mid-2026
3. FY26 guidance is flat-to-down (no recovery)
4. Dividend flat or cut
5. Stock re-rates from 9.5x to 7x P/E = 130p (32% downside)

Probability of this scenario: 15-20%.

### Rate the overall thesis

**MODERATE BEAR (leaning toward STRONG BEAR)**

Rationale:
- 4 of 10 claims receive STRONG COUNTER (3/3)
- 5 of 10 claims receive MODERATE COUNTER (2/3)
- Only 1 of 10 claims survives with WEAK COUNTER (1/3)
- Total 23/30 adversarial points = the thesis is materially challenged
- The position at 191p has minimal MoS vs realistic FV of 230-245p (16-22% upside, not 53%)
- The bear case is AT or BELOW current price
- Asymmetric risk: 15-20% chance of 130p (-32%) vs 20-25% chance of 290p (+52%)
- Expected value accounting for all scenarios: approximately 220-240p (15-25% upside, not 53%)

## Fair Value Range from Bear Perspective

| Method | Bear | Base | Bull |
|--------|------|------|------|
| Devil's Advocate (ex-IFRS 16) | 189p | 197p | 250p |
| Devil's Advocate (IFRS 16 incl) | 120p | 142p | 189p |
| Valuation Specialist | 184p | 263p | 367p |
| Risk-Identifier adjusted | 200p | 237p | 310p |
| **Adversarial Consensus** | **180-190p** | **220-245p** | **300-330p** |

**At 191p, the risk/reward is approximately:**
- Downside to bear: 0-6% (essentially at bear FV already)
- Upside to adversarial base: 15-28%
- Upside to adversarial bull: 57-73%

This is NOT the 37-58% upside the thesis claims. The real risk/reward is mediocre at current price.

## Veredicto Global

| Metric | Valor |
|--------|-------|
| Claims with STRONG COUNTER (3/3) | 4 of 10 |
| Claims with MODERATE COUNTER (2/3) | 5 of 10 |
| Claims with WEAK COUNTER (1/3) | 1 of 10 |
| Total adversarial score | 23/30 (18/24 scale) |
| Thesis FV vs Adversarial Consensus FV | 294p vs 230-245p (-17% to -22%) |
| Bear case vs current price | 180-190p vs 191p (AT current price) |
| Desafios HIGH/CRITICAL | 8+ across thesis + independent reports |
| Veredicto | **STRONG COUNTER** |

### Interpretacion:
**STRONG COUNTER:** The thesis has serious problems across multiple dimensions:
1. Consumer recovery assumption contradicted by every macro source
2. CEO vacuum prolonging with no timeline
3. Market share metric misleadingly narrow
4. Fair value materially overstated
5. Bear case at current price provides no downside protection
6. Multiple correlated risks create negative feedback loop potential

---

## Recomendacion al Investment Committee

1. **IMMEDIATELY reassess conviction.** The current position (175 shares at 183p, now 191p) has a small gain. But the adversarial evidence suggests minimal further upside (15-25%) with meaningful downside risk (30%+ if FY25 disappoints).

2. **DO NOT ADD before FY25 results (March 5).** The thesis has ADD triggers at 170p and 160p. Given the adversarial findings, these triggers should be suspended until after FY25 results provide clarity on the "trough" assumption.

3. **Revise Fair Value to 230-245p (adversarial consensus).** This still provides approximately 20-28% MoS at 191p, which is acceptable for Tier B. But it is NOT the 37% the thesis claims.

4. **Add new kill conditions:**
   - No permanent CEO by September 2026 (12 months)
   - FY25 EBITDA below GBP 125M
   - Net store openings below 20/year for 2 consecutive years
   - Same-store sales negative for 3 consecutive reporting periods
   - Aggregator share of DOM orders exceeds 35%

5. **Consider TRIM to minimal position (1-2%).** Given Principle 9 (Quality Gravitates Upward), DOM.L at QS 61 (Tier B) is not the best use of capital when the portfolio has multiple Tier A opportunities with 30%+ MoS. The small position size (GBP 320 invested) means exit friction is negligible.

6. **Resolve the IFRS 16 leverage question.** The thesis claims 1.93x; the quality scorer shows 4.6x. This is a 2.5x discrepancy that materially affects the risk assessment. The valuation specialist's deep dive suggests company-reported ex-IFRS 16 net debt of GBP 265.5M is the correct figure for franchise models, but this should be documented as a policy.

7. **Wait for FY25 results before any action other than TRIM.** March 5 is the critical date. If EBITDA comes in at GBP 135-140M (high end of guidance) and FY26 guidance shows recovery, the thesis gains credibility. If EBITDA is below GBP 130M or FY26 guidance is flat, the thesis is likely broken.

---

## 🔄 META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres
- The IFRS 16 treatment creates a massive swing in fair value (120-189p inclusive vs 189-250p exclusive). For a franchise model where DPG holds head leases backed by franchisee income, the truth is likely closer to the ex-IFRS 16 figure, but this uncertainty alone spans 60p per share.
- I could not access the FY24 annual report PDF to verify exact covenant terms, lease maturity schedules, and net lease liability details.
- The CHICK'N'DIP trial is running in 187 stores but I could not find trial results (sales mix, incremental traffic). If successful, this could be genuinely transformative -- chicken is a GBP 6B+ UK market. But without data, it is speculative.
- Q4 2025 / FY25 full-year data is not yet available. FY25 results on March 5 will be the single most important data point for this thesis.

### Limitaciones de Este Analisis
- Could not access paywalled sources (Proactive Investors detail, IBIS World full report, Mintel foodservice delivery report)
- Franchisee-level economics rely on company-disclosed averages (GBP 168K). Median and bottom-quartile franchisee profitability may be materially worse.
- No access to sell-side research notes beyond headlines (Deutsche Bank downgrade rationale partially visible)
- The "big 3 franchisees control 50% of estate" claim from ainvest/Johan Lunau could not be verified from primary sources

### Sugerencias para el Sistema
- All thesis files should run quality_scorer.py and use standardized QS, not ad-hoc scoring. The thesis uses a 6/10 scoring system that is not comparable to the 0-100 QS system.
- The IFRS 16 treatment in DCF calculations needs a documented policy across the system. This affects ALL companies with significant leases.
- Kill conditions should ALWAYS include governance metrics (CEO vacancy duration) for companies in leadership transition.
- Add UK consumer confidence (GfK index) to standing monitoring metrics in state/system.yaml for all UK consumer discretionary positions.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator
1. Given that three independent analyses converge on FV 20-25% below thesis, should the thesis FV be formally revised before March 5 results?
2. Should the ADD triggers (170p, 160p) be formally suspended given the adversarial findings?
3. Is the position size (GBP 320, approximately 3-4% of portfolio) justified given QS 61 and the adversarial FV suggesting minimal MoS? Principle 9 suggests this capital would be better deployed in Tier A.
4. Should we treat FY25 results (March 5) as a binary event and reduce position BEFORE to manage risk?
