## Top 5 Riesgos Criticos

### 1. CEO + CFO Vacuum During Critical Reporting Period (CRITICAL)

- **Categoria:** Governance
- **Descripcion:** Andrew Rennie stepped down Nov 25, 2025, "by mutual agreement with immediate effect" after underlying profits dropped 15% in H1 2025. As of Feb 9, 2026 (2.5 months later), NO permanent CEO has been announced. The Board has "commenced a search process" with NO timeline. Nicola Frampton (COO) serves as Interim CEO. The new CFO Andy Andrea does not start until March 16, 2026 -- meaning FY25 results on March 5 will be presented by an interim CEO and the outgoing interim finance team. This is a dual leadership vacuum during the most critical reporting event of the year.
- **Evidencia:**
  - CEO departure was not planned succession -- it was a forced exit after profit decline and stock collapse (-47% in 2025, steepest single-day decline on H1 results)
  - The company explicitly stated: "we do not envisage pursuing a second brand acquisition until the new CEO is in place"
  - Chick'N'Dip chicken strategy (Rennie's initiative) is now orphaned with no champion
  - Deutsche Bank DOWNGRADED from Buy to Hold citing "materially changed" investment case
  - Browning West (5% activist shareholder) published open letter in Sept 2025 demanding strategic pause and GBP 100M+ buyback, calling the Board's second brand strategy into question
  - Previous CEO Wild also departed under pressure (2019), suggesting a pattern of management instability
- **Probabilidad:** Alta (65%) -- CEO searches for a GBP 730M market cap company with declining earnings and an activist shareholder are difficult. Typical timeline 6-12 months.
- **Impacto si materializa:** -15-25% further downside. Strategic drift with all growth initiatives paused. Franchisee confidence erodes. Analyst target prices continue declining (average already down 12.1% from 306p to 269p).
- **Mitigante:** Franchise model is operationally autonomous. Board has appointed experienced NEDs. COO has operational credibility. But none of this replaces strategic leadership.
- **Kill condition?:** YES -- suggested. No permanent CEO by Sep 2026 (12 months) = SELL.

### 2. UK Consumer Weakness Is Structural, Not Cyclical (CRITICAL)

- **Categoria:** Macro
- **Descripcion:** The thesis assumes UK consumer is recovering and rate cuts will help. Every authoritative data source contradicts this for 2026.
- **Evidencia:**
  - **KPMG (Dec 2025):** UK GDP expected to SLOW to 1.0% in 2026 (from 1.4% in 2025)
  - **Unemployment:** Forecast to RISE to 5.2% in 2026
  - **Wage growth:** Expected to slow to 3% by mid-2026 (vs 6%+ in 2024)
  - **Consumer confidence:** Deloitte index fell to -11.1% in Q4 2025, lowest in 2 years
  - **Spending intentions:** 27% plan to spend LESS in 2026; only 13% MORE; 49% cutting discretionary
  - **Bank of England:** Rate at 4.5% with no cuts expected near-term. Thesis catalyst of "H2 2026 rate cuts" is increasingly uncertain
  - **BMI/Fitch:** "Weak spending outlook" for UK 2026
  - **DPG's own data:** LFL sales -0.1% in H1 2025; first 10 weeks of FY25 only +0.7%; pizza delivery category -0.8% overall
- **Probabilidad:** Alta (60%) -- multiple authoritative sources converge on the same direction
- **Impacto si materializa:** -20-30%. Consumer discretionary spending is the SOLE revenue driver for pizza delivery. If UK consumer stays weak, FY26 EBITDA will be flat-to-down vs thesis recovery assumption. Fair value drops from thesis 290p to ~200-220p.
- **Mitigante:** Pizza is relatively cheap vs dining out. Deals-focused strategy. But when 49% of consumers are cutting discretionary spend, even "affordable" luxuries get squeezed.
- **Kill condition?:** YES -- suggested. If SSS remain negative for 3 consecutive reporting periods while consumer confidence stays below -10%, the "cyclical trough" thesis is wrong. This is structural.

### 3. Franchisee Profitability Double-Squeeze: Legislated and Compounding (CRITICAL)

- **Categoria:** Operational / Fundamental
- **Descripcion:** UK franchisees face a historic, legislated double cost shock that is NOT one-time but compounds year-over-year. The thesis mentions NLW generically but does not quantify the cumulative, compounding nature of this squeeze.
- **Evidencia:**
  - **April 2024:** NLW increased 10% (GBP 11.44 to GBP 12.21/hr)
  - **April 2025:** Employer NI increased from 13.8% to 15.0% AND threshold dropped from GBP 9,100 to GBP 5,000/yr. For a typical franchisee with 20 part-time workers, this adds GBP 6,000-12,000/yr in NI alone
  - **April 2026:** NLW rising further 4.1% to GBP 12.71/hr; youth rates up 8.5% to GBP 10.85/hr
  - **UKHospitality:** GBP 1.4 BILLION additional cost for hospitality sector; 70% of hospitality businesses plan to reduce employment
  - **Impact on franchisee P&L:** Thesis claims GBP 168K average store profit (14% margin, 45-50% ROI). But this is FY24 data BEFORE the double hit. A GBP 15-25K annual cost increase per store (NLW + NI combined) reduces store profit to GBP 143-153K and ROI to ~38-41%. This makes marginal locations uneconomic.
  - **Leading indicator already flashing red:** Store openings collapsed from 54 in FY24 to "mid-twenties" guided for FY25 (only 18 opened by Q3 2025). Franchisees are voting with their wallets.
  - **Margin compression visible:** H1 2025 EBITDA down 7.4% to GBP 63.9M DESPITE revenue growing 1.4%. This is pure margin squeeze.
  - **Meal deal pricing pressure:** Pizza meal deals' share of menus grew from 16% to 20%, while average pizza meal deal prices FELL 2% (vs +8% for other fast food). Franchisees cannot pass costs through because they are already discounting to compete.
- **Probabilidad:** Alta (55%) -- the cost increases are ALREADY LEGISLATED. The question is only the severity of the pass-through failure.
- **Impacto si materializa:** -15-20%. Fewer store openings = less growth. Lower franchisee profits = less reinvestment = structural deceleration. DPG's supply chain revenue (67% of total) depends on franchisee volume.
- **Mitigante:** PGF 2025-2030 framework. DPG subsidizes franchisees GBP 7-9M/year (but this directly reduces DPG margins). AI logistics. Third-party delivery partnerships reduce in-house staffing needs.
- **Kill condition?:** YES -- suggested. Net store openings below 20/year for 2 consecutive years = growth thesis is broken.

### 4. Aggregator Platform Commoditization of Delivery + Shrinking Category (HIGH)

- **Categoria:** Competitive / Strategic
- **Descripcion:** The thesis frames competition as "Domino's vs Papa John's vs Pizza Hut" where Domino's is winning. The actual competitive battleground has shifted fundamentally to "Domino's vs everything on Uber Eats/Deliveroo/Just Eat," where Domino's is a small player. Moreover, pizza delivery as a standalone category is the ONLY QSR segment in decline.
- **Evidencia:**
  - **Uber Eats:** 27.2% of ALL UK delivery occasions (market leader by occasion, overtook Just Eat in 2024)
  - **Just Eat:** 25.2% share (declining but massive)
  - **Deliveroo:** 16.2% share
  - **Pizza delivery category:** -0.8% decline in 2025 -- the only QSR category declining
  - DOM's share in total UK takeaway is only 7.2% (gained just +20bps in H1 2025). The "54% market share" is of a narrowly defined, SHRINKING niche.
  - Even Domino's itself now lists on Just Eat and Uber Eats, PAYING commissions to platforms that simultaneously promote competitors
  - 24% of Domino's digital orders already go through aggregators (not the own app) -- each one costs margin and customer data
  - Supermarket chilled pizza value sales grew 4.8% in 2025, with supermarket "meal deals taking a bite out of higher-ticket orders"
  - Ghost kitchens and independent restaurants on aggregators now offer pizza at lower price points
- **Probabilidad:** Media (45%) -- trend clearly accelerating but Domino's brand, speed, and app ecosystem provide real defenses
- **Impacto si materializa:** -15-25%. If aggregator share of pizza delivery grows structurally, Domino's loses pricing power, customer data, and margin. The "captive supply chain" moat is only as strong as franchisee volume, which is already under pressure.
- **Mitigante:** 9.5M app users. Loyalty program (630K enrolled, targeting 3M). 24.5 minute average delivery. Brand recognition. But these are defenses, not expanding moats.
- **Kill condition?:** YES -- suggested. If aggregator share of Domino's orders exceeds 35% (from ~24% now), the direct-to-consumer moat is eroding.

### 5. Activist Shareholder Pressure + Worsening Balance Sheet Trajectory (HIGH)

- **Categoria:** Financial / Governance
- **Descripcion:** The thesis cites "Net Debt/EBITDA 1.93x manageable." But the balance sheet trajectory is deteriorating on every metric, an activist shareholder is demanding capital allocation changes, and net debt guidance has ALREADY been revised upward.
- **Evidencia:**
  - **Net debt trajectory:** GBP 233M (FY23) to GBP 265M (FY24) to GBP 280-300M guided (FY25) -- consistently RISING
  - **Shareholder equity:** NEGATIVE GBP 134M. Total liabilities GBP 646.5M vs Total assets GBP 512.5M
  - **Quality Scorer leverage:** 4.6x (0 out of 10 points) -- vs thesis claim of 1.93x. The discrepancy is IFRS 16 leases (GBP ~230M gross)
  - **FY25 net debt guidance revised UPWARD:** Company now guides GBP 280-300M (originally implied ~265M continuation). This is a warning sign.
  - **Browning West (5% shareholder):** Published open letter Sept 2025 demanding: (a) pause brand acquisitions for 6 months, (b) GBP 100M+ buyback, (c) consider take-private with PE partner. Board responded with only GBP 20M buyback -- far less than demanded.
  - **Dividend sustainability:** Dividend growing +2.9% while earnings declining -14.3% in H1 2025. Payout ratio is rising. Previous COVID dividend cut shows willingness to cut if needed.
  - **Interest expense:** GBP 27M on GBP 551M total debt = 4.9% average cost. If refinanced at higher rates (UK rates at 4.5%), this could increase.
- **Probabilidad:** Media (40%) -- current levels manageable but trajectory is wrong direction, and activist pressure complicates capital allocation
- **Impacto si materializa:** -20-30%. If Browning West escalates (board seats, take-private bid), creates governance distraction during CEO search. If debt continues rising and EBITDA declining, covenant pressure emerges. Dividend cut (existing kill condition) becomes more probable.
- **Mitigante:** Asset-light model generates GBP 70-85M FCF/year. GBP 52M cash. GBP 300M RCF refinanced to 2030.
- **Kill condition?:** Existing: Net Debt/EBITDA > 3.0x. Should be tightened to 2.5x given worsening trajectory and IFRS 16 discrepancy.

---

## Additional Risks (Not in Top 5 but Material)

### 6. Franchisee Concentration Risk (HIGH)

- **Description:** Top 3 franchisees generate >50% of system sales. Two franchisees alone account for ~40%. This is fundamentally different from the US Domino's model where the largest franchisee is a small percentage of total.
- **Evidence:** Company disclosures. Historical precedent: 2017-2021 franchisee dispute took 4 years to resolve and cost GBP 20M settlement + management distraction.
- **Impact:** If one major franchisee has a dispute, financial difficulty, or decides to exit, it could disrupt 15-20% of system sales and supply chain revenue.
- **Thesis treatment:** NOT MENTIONED. The thesis assumes franchisee alignment without acknowledging this concentration risk.

### 7. Master Franchise Agreement Dependency (MEDIUM)

- **Description:** DPG pays 2.7% of system sales to DPZ Inc (US parent) as royalty. This is a non-negotiable cost that flows to the US parent regardless of DPG's profitability. DPZ has been pushing master franchisees globally on store growth and performance.
- **Evidence:** DPZ class action in the US re: store growth guidance. DPZ closed 200+ stores internationally (Japan). Global franchisee challenges.
- **Impact:** If DPZ increases royalty rates at renewal, or imposes stricter performance requirements (store opening minimums), DPG has limited bargaining power.
- **Thesis treatment:** Mentioned briefly. Risk appropriately rated as low probability but high impact.

### 8. FY25 Results Event Risk - March 5 (HIGH, near-term)

- **Description:** FY25 results release March 5, 2026, will be presented by interim CEO (Frampton) and outgoing interim finance team (new CFO Andrea starts March 16). Last results release (H1 2025, Aug 2025) caused a 20%+ single-day stock decline.
- **Evidence:** H1 2025 EBITDA GBP 63.9M needs H2 of GBP 66-76M to hit GBP 130-140M guidance. Q3 trading update showed 2.1% system sales growth and maintained guidance. But the gap between "maintaining guidance" and "delivering it" is where risk lies.
- **Risk scenarios:**
  - EBITDA at low end (GBP 130M) or below: stock drops 10-15%
  - EBITDA miss (<GBP 128M): stock drops 15-25% (repeat of H1 reaction)
  - No CEO announcement at results: stock drifts further as hope fades
- **This is only 24 days away and represents the highest near-term risk.**

## Kill Conditions Sugeridas

(In addition to existing thesis kill conditions: Net Debt/EBITDA > 3.0x, FCF < GBP 50M, market share < 45%, dividend cut)

1. **No permanent CEO appointed by Sep 2026 (12 months from departure)** -- 12 months without strategic leadership is unacceptable for a company in transition. If still searching at 12 months, sell.

2. **FY25 EBITDA below GBP 125M** (below even the guided GBP 130-140M range) -- would signal accelerating deterioration and management inability to forecast. Results due March 5, just 24 days away.

3. **Net store openings below 20/year for 2 consecutive years** -- growth thesis depends on 50+ stores/year. FY25 already likely to be "mid-twenties." If FY26 is also <20, the model is breaking.

4. **Same-store sales negative for 3 consecutive reporting periods** -- H1 2025 was -0.1% LFL. If this continues through H2 2025 and H1 2026, the demand problem is structural.

5. **Aggregator share of Domino's orders exceeds 35%** -- currently ~24%. Would indicate erosion of direct-to-consumer moat and increasing margin pressure.

6. **Tighten existing Net Debt/EBITDA kill from 3.0x to 2.5x (ex-IFRS 16)** -- given net debt already guided to GBP 280-300M on GBP 130-140M EBITDA, the company could breach 2.0x in FY25. The 3.0x threshold gives false comfort.

## Riesgo Agregado

- **Number of HIGH+CRITICAL risks:** 10 (3 CRITICAL + 7 HIGH)
- **Correlated risks?** YES -- Five of the top risks form a **negative feedback loop**:

```
UK Consumer Weakness (R2)
    |
    v
LFL Sales Decline / Negative SSS (R8)
    |
    v
Franchisee Margin Squeeze (R3) <-- Amplified by legislated NLW + NI costs
    |
    v
Franchisee Reluctance to Invest (R6)
    |
    v
Store Openings Collapse --> Growth Slows --> EBITDA Declines
    |
    v
Net Debt/EBITDA Worsens (R5) --> Dividend Risk --> Stock Price Falls
    |
    v
CEO Recruitment Harder (R1) --> Strategic Vacuum Extends
    |
    v
Activist Escalation (R9) --> Governance Distraction
```

This feedback loop is the single most concerning finding. The thesis treats each risk independently. In reality, they are deeply interconnected and each one amplifies the others. The probability that NONE of these risks materialize is very low, and the probability that SEVERAL materialize simultaneously is material (~30-40%).

- **Risk Score Final: HIGH (borderline VERY HIGH)**

The score is HIGH rather than VERY HIGH because:
- The franchise model does generate real, positive FCF even in downturns (GBP 70-85M)
- The master franchise provides genuine exclusivity and brand power
- The RCF refinancing to 2030 removes near-term liquidity risk
- The dividend yield (5.8%) provides some downside support
- The stock has already declined 47% in 2025, pricing in much (but not all) bad news

But the direction of every key metric is WRONG: EBITDA declining, leverage rising, store openings collapsing, consumer weakening, management departing. The thesis's "trough and recovery" narrative is not supported by current evidence.

---

## Valuation Impact

The thesis fair value of 290p (base) / 294p (expected) assumes:
- FY26 FCF of GBP 85M (likely optimistic: H1 2025 run rate implies GBP 70-80M)
- 3% revenue growth (SSS was -4.2% FY24, -0.1% LFL H1 2025)
- Consumer recovery in H2 2026 (data contradicts: KPMG, Deloitte, BMI all negative)
- WACC of 8.5% (should be 9.1-9.5% per independent valuation: size premium + CEO risk)
- EV/EBIT multiple of 12.5x (independent suggests 11.5x: small cap illiquidity discount)

**Independent Valuation Specialist FV: 269p (expected)**
**Devil's Advocate FV range: 142-197p** (bear case using IFRS 16-inclusive debt)

**Risk-adjusted fair value estimate (my independent view):**
- Bear probability: 30% (not thesis 25% -- given consumer data and feedback loop)
- Base case FCF: GBP 75-80M (not 85M -- reflecting H1 2025 trends)
- Bull probability: 20% (not 25% -- CEO vacancy dampens upside catalysts)
- Bear scenario FV: 184p (valuation specialist) to 190p (EV/EBIT 9x on GBP 110M EBIT)
- Base scenario FV: 240-265p (valuation specialist range)
- Bull scenario FV: 350-367p (dependent on CEO + consumer recovery)

**Weighted expected value:**
(187p x 0.30) + (253p x 0.50) + (358p x 0.20) = 56 + 126.5 + 71.6 = **254p**

**Further risk-correlation discount (-10%):** 254p x 0.90 = **229p**

**Risk-Adjusted FV: ~225-235p** vs thesis 290p, a reduction of **-19% to -22%**

At current price 191p, this gives MoS of ~18-23% -- still positive but MATERIALLY lower than the thesis's claimed 37.6%.

The bear case FV of 184-190p is DANGEROUSLY close to the current price of 191p. This means the downside protection is minimal on a bear-weighted basis. The thesis's bear case (220p) provides a 15% cushion; the independent bear case provides effectively NONE.

## Adversarial Challenges to Thesis Claims

### Claim 1: "54% UK pizza delivery market share"
**Assessment: PARTIALLY VALID but MISLEADING in context.**
The 54% refers to branded pizza delivery/takeaway only. In the broader food delivery market, DOM's total UK takeaway share is only 7.2% (gained just +20bps in H1 2025). The relevant market is shifting from "pizza delivery" to "food delivery" -- where Uber Eats (27.2%), Just Eat (25.2%), and Deliveroo (16.2%) are the actual gatekeepers. Claiming 54% share of a -0.8% declining category is not the same as dominance.

### Claim 2: "FCF GBP 87M"
**Assessment: HISTORICAL, NOT FORWARD-LOOKING.**
FY24 FCF was GBP 85M (valuation specialist figure) to 87M (thesis). But H1 2025 EBITDA was GBP 63.9M (down 7.4%), and H1 underlying FCF was only GBP 28.7M. Full-year FY25 FCF could be GBP 65-75M. The thesis base case of GBP 85M for FY26 requires a recovery that the consumer data does not support.

### Claim 3: "ROIC ~30%"
**Assessment: MATHEMATICALLY MEANINGLESS.**
ROIC calculated on negative shareholder equity (GBP -134M) produces artificially inflated figures. The quality scorer shows ROIC spread of only 6.4pp -- decent but not exceptional. Thesis should use ROIC on total capital employed (debt + equity), which would be far lower.

### Claim 4: "Net Debt/EBITDA 1.93x manageable"
**Assessment: UNDERSTATED and WORSENING.**
The 1.93x excludes IFRS 16 leases. Quality scorer shows 4.6x. More critically, the company ALREADY revised FY25 net debt guidance UPWARD to GBP 280-300M. On GBP 130-140M EBITDA, that is 2.0-2.3x ex-IFRS 16 -- breaching the midpoint of the 1.5-2.5x target range.

### Claim 5: "Franchise model runs itself without CEO"
**Assessment: PARTIALLY TRUE operationally, FALSE strategically.**
Day-to-day stores run autonomously. But brand acquisition paused, store expansion halved, chicken strategy orphaned, capital allocation uncertain, activist shareholder demanding changes. The franchise model generates cash; leadership determines what to do with it.

### Claim 6: "UK consumer recovering"
**Assessment: FALSE based on current data.**
KPMG, Deloitte, BMI/Fitch, GfK all show deteriorating UK consumer outlook for 2026. Unemployment rising, wage growth slowing, confidence at 2-year lows, 49% cutting discretionary spend.

### Claim 7: "Pizza = affordable luxury, resilient"
**Assessment: UNDER PRESSURE from multiple angles.**
Supermarket chilled pizza (growing 4.8%) is cheaper. Pizza delivery meal deal prices are falling (-2%) while costs are rising. 70% of hospitality businesses plan to reduce employment. "Affordable luxury" works when consumers have disposable income -- with 5.2% unemployment forecast and 49% cutting discretionary, this assumption weakens.

### Claim 8: "Competitors closing, DOM gaining share"
**Assessment: TRUE HISTORICALLY, STALLING NOW.**
DOM added 90+ stores in FY23-FY24 while competitors contracted. But DOM's own openings collapsed to 18 by Q3 2025 (vs 54 in FY24). DOM gained +560bps in pizza takeaway share but only +20bps in total UK takeaway. The real competitive threat is not Papa John's closing -- it is aggregators making every restaurant a pizza competitor.

## 🔄 META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres
- **IFRS 16 treatment is the central analytical ambiguity.** The valuation specialist correctly identified this: excluding leases gives ND/EBITDA 1.93x and FV ~269p; including gives 4.6x and significantly lower FV. For a franchise model where DPG holds head leases and sub-leases to franchisees (net lease liability only GBP 23M per company), the exclusion may be justified. But the thesis should be EXPLICIT about this choice and its impact.
- **Q3 2025 trading update showed 2.1% system sales growth and maintained guidance** -- this is more positive than H1 suggested. If H2 came in strong, the feedback loop concern may be premature. FY25 results on March 5 are the critical data point.
- **The 54% market share methodology** is unclear. Is it by value? Volume? Branded outlets? This matters enormously for assessing the competitive moat.
- **Franchisee-level economics** are based on company disclosures (GBP 168K average). Median or bottom-quartile franchisees may be significantly worse. I could not access granular franchisee profitability data.

### Riesgos que Podrian Estar Subestimados
- **Aggregator disruption (R4):** Rated at 45% probability. But Uber Eats went from minor player to 27.2% of all UK delivery occasions in a few years. If this trend continues, Domino's moat erodes structurally even if the 54% pizza share holds numerically. The thesis treats aggregators as complementary (additional demand channel); I believe they are fundamentally threatening (commoditize delivery, erode brand premium).
- **Franchisee concentration (R11):** Top 3 franchisees generating >50% of sales is a single-point-of-failure risk that the thesis does not address at all. The 2017-2021 dispute took 4 years and cost GBP 20M to resolve. If a major franchisee exits or enters dispute during the CEO vacuum, impact would be severe.
- **Pattern of management instability:** Both Wild (2019) and Rennie (2025) departed under pressure. Two forced CEO exits in 6 years at a company with a GBP 730M market cap suggests either the Board or the business itself is fundamentally challenging to lead. This may make CEO recruitment harder and could warrant a permanent governance discount.

### Discrepancias con Thesis
1. **Consumer recovery assumption:** Thesis says "recovering." Every macro source says "deteriorating." This is the SINGLE LARGEST factual discrepancy.
2. **Leverage figure:** Thesis says 1.93x. Quality scorer says 4.6x. Regardless of IFRS 16 treatment, the TRAJECTORY is worsening, and net debt guidance was revised upward.
3. **ROIC claim:** Thesis says ~30%. On negative equity this is meaningless. QS ROIC spread is 6.4pp.
4. **Store expansion:** Thesis treats 2,000-store target as achievable. At 20-25 stores/year actual pace (from 1,372 now), reaching 2,000 would take ~25 years.
5. **SSS omission:** Thesis does not highlight that SSS turned negative. FY24 was -4.2%, H1 2025 LFL was -0.1%.
6. **Pizza category decline:** Thesis does not mention that pizza delivery is the ONLY UK QSR segment in decline (-0.8%).
7. **Activist shareholder:** Browning West's demands and public letter are not in the thesis. This is a live governance risk.
8. **Franchisee concentration:** Not mentioned at all. Top 3 = >50% of sales.
9. **Net debt guidance revision:** Thesis uses GBP 280M static. Company already guided upward to GBP 280-300M.

### Sugerencias para el Sistema
- **Add lease-adjusted leverage to quality_scorer.py output** alongside IFRS 16-inclusive figure, with a flag when the two diverge by >1.5x
- **Consumer confidence tracker:** Add UK GfK/Deloitte consumer confidence index to world/current_view.md as monitoring metric for all UK consumer discretionary positions (DOM.L, IMB.L, FUTR.L)
- **Franchisee health metrics:** For franchise-model investments, track store openings vs targets as a leading indicator
- **Activist shareholder monitoring:** For all positions, periodic check for activist involvement (can impact capital allocation, governance, and strategy)

### Preguntas para Orchestrator
1. **FY25 results on March 5 are 24 days away.** Should we consider reducing position size BEFORE results, given that the last results release caused a -20% single-day decline? The risk-reward of holding through results is asymmetric: if results are good, stock may rise 5-10%; if results disappoint, stock could fall 15-25%.
2. **The leverage discrepancy (1.93x vs 4.6x) needs policy resolution.** For franchise models where head leases are offset by franchisee sub-leases (net lease liability only GBP 23M), should we use ex-IFRS 16 or inclusive? This affects not just DOM.L but any future franchise investments.
3. **Conviction level:** With 10 HIGH/CRITICAL risks, 5 of which form a negative feedback loop, and near-zero bear-case MoS, should conviction be LOW? The adversarial evidence suggests this position has significantly worse risk-reward than the thesis claims.
4. **Principle 9 (Quality Gravitates Upward):** DOM.L at QS 61 (Tier B, with Financial Quality only 17/40) -- is this the best use of GBP 335 (175 shares x 191p)? The capital could be redeployed to Tier A positions with higher conviction and better risk-reward.
