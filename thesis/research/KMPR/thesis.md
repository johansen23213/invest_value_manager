# KMPR - Kemper Corporation

> Analysis Date: 2026-02-04
> Framework Version: 3.0 (Quality First)
> Status: **WATCHLIST** (NOT BUY)

## TL;DR

Kemper is a specialty auto insurer focused on underserved markets (non-standard auto, Hispanic/Latino communities) trading at 0.89x P/B and P/E ~10x. However, the stock is down 46% from 52w high for GOOD REASONS: Q3 2025 combined ratio deteriorated to 99.6% (from 91.3% YoY), multiple analyst downgrades citing "peak earnings" concerns, and fundamental deterioration in auto insurance sector. **Quality Score 45/100 = Tier C** requires 30-40% MoS, which the current valuation does not provide with sufficient confidence given operational headwinds.

## Quality Score: 45/100 -> Tier C

### FINANCIAL QUALITY (40 pts max) -> 17/40

| Metric | Value | Points | Max |
|--------|-------|--------|-----|
| **ROIC Spread** | ROIC 8.2% - WACC ~9% = -0.8pp | 0 | 15 |
| **FCF Margin** | ~6-7% (insurance metrics differ) | 2 | 10 |
| **Leverage** | Net Debt/EBITDA <2x, Debt/Capital 22.9% post-redemption | 8 | 10 |
| **FCF Consistency** | Mixed: 2022-2023 losses, 2024 positive | 3 | 5 |
| **Subtotal Financial** | | **17** | **40** |

Notes:
- ROIC at 8.2% (2024) is BELOW estimated WACC of ~9%, meaning negative spread
- Balance sheet improved after $450M debt redemption (Feb 2025), debt-to-capital now 22.9%
- FCF volatile due to underwriting cycle - losses in 2022-2023, recovery in 2024

### GROWTH QUALITY (25 pts max) -> 5/25

| Metric | Value | Points | Max |
|--------|-------|--------|-----|
| **Revenue CAGR 5yr** | Flat to negative (-6% in 2024) | 0 | 10 |
| **EPS CAGR 5yr** | Negative (-2% annual avg) | 0 | 10 |
| **Gross Margin Trend** | Improving (CR 91.5% 2024 vs 107% 2023) but Q3 2025 deteriorating | 5 | 5 |
| **Subtotal Growth** | | **5** | **25** |

Notes:
- Revenue DECLINED from $4.91B (2023) to $4.63B (2024)
- EPS has been negative for 5-year period due to underwriting losses in 2022-2023
- Combined ratio IMPROVED dramatically in 2024 (91.5%) but Q3 2025 shows 99.6% - trend reversing

### MOAT EVIDENCE (25 pts max) -> 12/25

| Metric | Value | Points | Max |
|--------|-------|--------|-----|
| **GM Premium vs Sector** | Combined ratio competitive but no premium | 4 | 10 |
| **Market Position** | #17 in US auto insurance, ~0.4% market share | 2 | 8 |
| **ROIC Persistence** | ROIC < WACC multiple years recently | 2 | 7 |
| **Subtotal Moat** | | **12** | **25** |

Notes:
- Focus on underserved Hispanic/Latino communities is differentiated but not defensible moat
- 22,000+ agent network is competitive advantage but easily replicable
- Progressive, GEICO, State Farm dominate with superior scale and telematics

### CAPITAL ALLOCATION (10 pts max) -> 11/10

| Metric | Value | Points | Max |
|--------|-------|--------|-----|
| **Shareholder Returns** | 31 years consecutive dividends | 5 | 5 |
| **Insider Ownership** | 0.77% - 4.1% (sources vary) | 3 | 5 |
| **Subtotal CapAlloc** | | **8** | **10** |

Notes:
- 31-year dividend history is excellent
- Dividend increased recently, yield 3.4%
- $14M share repurchases in 2024, modest but positive
- Insider ownership low but not concerning for insurance company

### QUALITY SCORE TOTAL: 42/100 -> **TIER C**

| Category | Score | Max |
|----------|-------|-----|
| Financial | 17 | 40 |
| Growth | 5 | 25 |
| Moat | 12 | 25 |
| Cap Alloc | 8 | 10 |
| **TOTAL** | **42** | **100** |

**Tier C Requirements:**
- MoS Required: 30-40%
- Max Position Size: 5%
- Requires CLEAR CATALYST
- Higher bar for conviction

## Business Understanding

### What Does Kemper Do?

Kemper Corporation is a specialty insurance provider focused primarily on **non-standard auto insurance** for underserved markets. Two segments:

1. **Specialty P&C Insurance (90% of premiums)**
   - Non-standard personal auto insurance
   - Commercial auto insurance
   - Target market: High-risk drivers, Latino/Hispanic communities, urban areas
   - Distribution: 22,000+ independent agents and brokers

2. **Life Insurance (10% of premiums)**
   - Term and whole life insurance
   - Medicare supplement products
   - Specialty health products

### Business Model

- **Revenue model**: Insurance premiums (transaction-based, renewable annually)
- **Unit economics**: Combined Ratio is key metric
  - CR <100% = underwriting profit
  - CR >100% = underwriting loss
- **Capital intensity**: HIGH - requires regulatory capital reserves, investment portfolio
- **Moat**: Weak - niche market focus but no structural barriers

### Recent Strategic Shift

In August 2023, Kemper exited standard/preferred personal lines (auto and home) to focus exclusively on non-standard insurance. This is a strategic pivot to higher-margin niche, but also reduces diversification.

### Revenue Breakdown (2024)
- Specialty P&C: ~$4.2B (90%)
- Life: ~$0.4B (10%)

## Por Que Esta Barata (Why Is It Cheap)

### Market Narrative (What the Market Believes)

1. **Peak earnings thesis**: Analysts (Piper Sandler, William Blair, Raymond James) believe 2024-early 2025 was peak profitability and margins will compress
2. **Auto insurance sector deterioration**: Rising claims severity (inflation, medical costs, litigation) is structural headwind
3. **Q3 2025 disaster**: Combined ratio jumped to 99.6% from 91.3% YoY, triggering multiple downgrades
4. **Premium growth decelerating**: From 28%+ growth to 7% YoY in Q2 2025
5. **Restructuring announcement**: $30M cost savings program signals management expects tough times

### Why Down 46% from 52w High

| Date | Event | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| Q2 2025 | Earnings miss ($1.30 vs $1.52 est) | -21% single day |
| Q3 2025 | Net loss $21M, CR 99.6% | -14% single day |
| Nov 2025 | Multiple analyst downgrades | Continued decline |
| Jan 2026 | William Blair: "auto fundamentals materially deteriorated" | Sentiment crusher |

### My Counter-Thesis (IF I Were to Buy)

1. **Valuation floor**: Trading at 0.89x book value with 31-year dividend history
2. **Turnaround history**: Improved from CR 107% (2023) to 91.5% (2024), can do it again
3. **Restructuring**: $30M cost savings will help margins
4. **Niche positioning**: Hispanic/Latino market is fastest growing demographic in US
5. **Investment income**: High-rate environment benefits insurance float

### BUT - Why Counter-Thesis is WEAK

1. **ROIC < WACC**: The business is NOT creating value at current returns
2. **No structural moat**: Progressive has telematics advantage, GEICO has cost advantage
3. **Cyclical bottom unclear**: CR deterioration in Q3 suggests we're not at trough
4. **Small scale disadvantage**: 0.4% market share means no pricing power
5. **Management credibility**: CEO "vowed swift action" in Q3 but Q4 results still weak

### Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | SI/NO | Comments |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Industry in secular decline | NO | Auto insurance stable |
| Technological disruption | MAYBE | Telematics favors larger players |
| Management destroying value | NO | Recent actions reasonable |
| Balance sheet deteriorating | NO | Improved, debt reduced |
| Insider selling | NO | Stable insider holdings |
| Dividend cut recent/likely | NO | 31-year track record, recently raised |
| Market share loss >2pp | MAYBE | Small player, unclear trend |
| ROIC < WACC 3+ years | **YES** | Multiple years below |
| FCF negative >2 years | MAYBE | 2022-2023 problematic |
| Goodwill >50% equity | NO | |

**Value Trap Score: 2-3/10** - Borderline, but ROIC<WACC is concerning

## Valuation

### Method 1: P/B vs ROE (60% weight) - Appropriate for Insurance

**Current metrics:**
- Price: $38.90
- Book Value Per Share: $43.68
- P/B: 0.89x
- ROE (TTM): 9.03%
- ROE (Q1 2025): 14% / Adjusted 21%

**Justified P/B calculation:**
```
P/B Justified = (ROE - g) / (Ke - g)

Using sustainable ROE of 10% (conservative):
g = 2% (terminal growth)
Ke = 10% (cost of equity)

P/B Justified = (10% - 2%) / (10% - 2%) = 1.0x

Book Value: $43.68
Fair Value (P/B 1.0x): $43.68
```

**If ROE improves to 12% (optimistic):**
```
P/B Justified = (12% - 2%) / (10% - 2%) = 1.25x
Fair Value: $43.68 * 1.25 = $54.60
```

### Method 2: EV/EBIT Mid-Cycle (40% weight)

Using normalized operating income:
- 2024 Operating Income: $520M (exceptional, up 662%)
- 2023 Operating Income: $68M (depressed)
- Mid-cycle estimate: $300M

**Valuation:**
```
Sector EV/EBIT: 8-10x (insurance)
Conservative multiple: 8x (given ROIC<WACC, no moat)

EV = $300M * 8 = $2.4B
Net Debt: ~$1B
Equity Value: $1.4B
Shares: 64M
Fair Value: $21.88/share
```

This suggests current price MAY be overvalued if earnings normalize lower.

### Weighted Fair Value

| Method | Fair Value | Weight | Weighted |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| P/B vs ROE (10% ROE) | $43.68 | 60% | $26.21 |
| EV/EBIT Mid-Cycle | $21.88 | 40% | $8.75 |
| **Weighted Average** | | | **$34.96** |

**With optimistic ROE (12%):**
| Method | Fair Value | Weight | Weighted |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| P/B vs ROE (12% ROE) | $54.60 | 60% | $32.76 |
| EV/EBIT Mid-Cycle | $28.00 | 40% | $11.20 |
| **Weighted Average** | | | **$43.96** |

### Fair Value Range: $35 - $55

The wide range reflects uncertainty:
- Bear (ROE 8%, EV/EBIT 6x): ~$30
- Base (ROE 10%, EV/EBIT 8x): ~$40
- Bull (ROE 14%, EV/EBIT 10x): ~$55

---

## Scenarios

| Scenario | Probability | Fair Value | Assumptions |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| **Bear** | 35% | $30 | CR stays >98%, ROE ~8%, no pricing power |
| **Base** | 45% | $40 | CR improves to 94-95%, ROE ~10% |
| **Bull** | 20% | $55 | Full turnaround, ROE >12%, market re-rates |

**Expected Value:**
```
EV = (0.35 * $30) + (0.45 * $40) + (0.20 * $55)
EV = $10.50 + $18.00 + $11.00
EV = $39.50
```

**Current Price: $38.90**
**MoS vs Expected Value: 1.5%** (INSUFFICIENT for Tier C)
**MoS vs Bear Case: -23%** (UNDERWATER)

---

## Margin of Safety Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current Price | $38.90 |
| Fair Value (Base) | $40.00 |
| Expected Value | $39.50 |
| MoS vs Base | **3%** |
| MoS vs EV | **1.5%** |
| MoS vs Bear | **-23%** (negative) |
| **MoS Required (Tier C)** | **30-40%** |
| **Verdict** | **FAIL** |

The current valuation does NOT provide sufficient margin of safety for a Tier C company.

---

## Analyst Consensus

| Source | Price Target | Rating |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| UBS (Seth Rosenberg) | $79 | Buy |
| Citizens JMP | $75 | - |
| Piper Sandler | $35 | Underweight |
| Average | $58.67 | Mixed |
| GuruFocus GF Value | $50.65 | - |

Wide dispersion reflects uncertainty. Bear case analysts (Piper Sandler) have been more accurate recently.

---

## Kill Conditions

If any of these occur, thesis is INVALID:

1. **Combined ratio stays >98% for 2+ consecutive quarters** (Q4 2025 results critical)
2. **ROE falls below 8%** sustainably
3. **Dividend cut or freeze** (would break 31-year streak)
4. **Market share loss accelerates** (evidence of competitive disadvantage)
5. **CEO/CFO departure** during turnaround
6. **Further analyst downgrades** with price targets below $35

---

## Catalysts

| Catalyst | Timeline | Probability | Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Q4 2025 earnings show CR improvement | Feb 4, 2026 | 40% | High |
| Restructuring benefits materialize | Q2-Q3 2026 | 50% | Medium |
| Auto insurance sector stabilizes | H2 2026 | 45% | High |
| Rate filings approved | H2 2026 | 70% | Medium |

**CRITICAL: Q4 2025 earnings on February 4, 2026 is the key data point.**

---

## Recommendation: WATCHLIST (NOT BUY)

### Why NOT BUY Now

1. **Insufficient MoS**: Tier C requires 30-40% MoS, current is ~3%
2. **Negative MoS vs Bear**: If bear case plays out, significant downside
3. **No clear catalyst**: Turnaround not yet evident in Q3 data
4. **Peak earnings risk**: Multiple analysts citing this concern
5. **ROIC < WACC**: Business not creating value at current returns

### What Would Make It a BUY

1. **Price below $30**: Would provide 25%+ MoS vs Bear case
2. **Q4/Q1 combined ratio <93%**: Proves turnaround is real
3. **ROE sustained >12%**: Shows business can create value
4. **Analyst upgrades**: Sentiment shift

### Entry Price Target

For Tier C with 30% MoS:
- Entry price = $40 * 0.70 = **$28**

For Tier C with 35% MoS:
- Entry price = $40 * 0.65 = **$26**

**WATCHLIST at price alert: $28**

---

## Comparison to Portfolio Holdings

We already own:
- **ALL (Allstate)**: P/E 6.6x, Tier B, better turnaround track record
- **GL (Globe Life)**: P/E 10x, ROE 20%, cleared regulatory overhang

KMPR does NOT offer superior risk/reward vs current insurance holdings.

---

## Meta-Reflection

### Dudas/Incertidumbres
1. Is the Q3 2025 deterioration temporary (weather, severity spike) or structural?
2. Will restructuring $30M savings materially impact profitability?
3. Is the Hispanic/Latino niche a real competitive advantage or marketing?

### Sugerencias de Mejora
1. Create insurance-specific valuation tool that incorporates combined ratio trends
2. Add auto insurance sector view to world/sectors/

### Anomalias Detectadas
1. Wide analyst target dispersion ($35 to $81) suggests high uncertainty
2. Insider ownership data conflicting (0.77% vs 4.1%) across sources

### Preguntas para Orchestrator
1. Should we wait for Q4 2025 earnings (Feb 4) before final decision?
2. Given we own ALL and GL, is insurance sector already adequately covered?
