## Valuation (3 Methods)

### Method 1: NAV-Based (Weight 50%)
EPRA NTA = EUR 1.1594/share. For a value-add business parks operator:
- Premium factors: internal platform, proven track record, 77% German occupancy = upside
- Discount factors: secondary asset quality, German RE headwinds, small cap
- **Fair multiple: 0.95x NAV** (slight discount for sector risk)
- **FV = EUR 1.1014 (95.5p)**

### Method 2: FFO Yield-Based (Weight 30%)
FY2025 FFO/share = EUR 0.0844. Target FFO yield for German business parks:
- Peer group: 7-9% FFO yield typical for secondary RE
- **Target: 8% FFO yield** (mid-range, reflects asset quality)
- **FV = EUR 1.055 (91.5p)**

### Method 3: Dividend Discount Model (Weight 20%)
Dividend = EUR 0.0615, growth = 2% (conservative, last year 1.7%), required return = 9%
- **FV = EUR 0.896 (77.7p)**

### Composite Fair Value
| Method | FV (EUR) | FV (GBp) | Weight |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| NAV 0.95x | 1.1014 | 95.5p | 50% |
| FFO 8% yield | 1.0550 | 91.5p | 30% |
| DDM 9%/2% | 0.8961 | 77.7p | 20% |
| **Composite** | **1.0464** | **90.7p** | 100% |

**Current price 98.25p is 8.3% ABOVE composite fair value.**

## Moat Assessment: NARROW

**Evidence FOR moat:**
1. Internal operating platform (digital marketing + call center + on-site sales) - difficult to replicate at scale
2. Deep German SME tenant relationships - 10,958 tenants, highly fragmented
3. Local market knowledge across 153 sites in Germany
4. Scale advantages in property management and procurement
5. Track record: 12 consecutive dividend increases

**Evidence AGAINST wide moat:**
1. Business parks are commodity assets - no structural scarcity
2. Low barriers to entry for new developments in many German locations
3. Short lease terms (flexibility cuts both ways)
4. No pricing power - tenants are cost-sensitive SMEs
5. UK expansion (BizSpace) dilutes German expertise

**Verdict: Narrow moat** - The internal platform creates operational edge but assets themselves are not scarce or irreplaceable.

## Risk Matrix (Top 5)

| # | Risk | Probability | Impact | P x I | Mitigation |
|---|------|-------------|--------|-------|------------|
| 1 | EUR 400M bond refinancing June 2026 | LOW (already covered by cash + RCF) | HIGH | MEDIUM | EUR 389M cash + EUR 150M undrawn RCF available |
| 2 | German commercial RE further devaluation | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | 77% occupancy = already conservative; value-add model less exposed to prime/grade A cycle |
| 3 | Interest rate sensitivity on refinancing | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | New 2032 bond at 4% vs 2.5% WACOD = cost of debt rising; net LTV 38.3% manageable |
| 4 | German economic recession hits SME tenants | MEDIUM | HIGH | HIGH | 10,958 tenants = extreme diversification, but all exposed to same macro |
| 5 | UK expansion risk (BizSpace) | LOW-MED | MEDIUM | LOW-MED | 15% of portfolio; different market dynamics; FX risk |

**Key concern**: Net LTV 38.3% is moderate but rising cost of debt (from 2.5% to 4%+ on refinancing) will compress FFO growth. The EUR 400M June 2026 maturity is well-covered but will reset at significantly higher rates.

## Quality Score: 5.5/10 = TIER B (25% MoS Required)

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| ROE >15% consistent | 4/10 | REIT ROE typically 8-10%, below threshold |
| FCF positive 5yr | 8/10 | FFO consistently positive and growing |
| D/E <1.0 | 5/10 | D/E 0.85, net LTV 38.3% - manageable but elevated |
| Dividend 10yr+ | 9/10 | 12 consecutive increases |
| Wide moat | 6/10 | Narrow - platform edge but commodity assets |
| Revenue stability | 7/10 | 10,958 tenants, diversified, but short leases |
| Management quality | 7/10 | Proven track record, Fitch BBB, disciplined acquisitions |
| Analyst coverage >10 | 2/10 | Only 5 analysts (undiscovered = opportunity but also risk) |
| Market cap >EUR 10B | 2/10 | ~EUR 1.7B - small cap |
| Defensive sector | 5/10 | RE semi-defensive but business parks more cyclical |
| **TOTAL** | **55/100** | **5.5/10** |

**Tier B requires minimum 25% margin of safety. Current MoS is NEGATIVE (-8.3%).**

## Margin of Safety Analysis

| Scenario | Fair Value | MoS at 98.25p |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Bull (1.0x NAV) | 100.5p | -2.2% |
| Base (Composite) | 90.7p | **-8.3%** |
| Bear (0.85x NAV) | 85.4p | -15.0% |

The stock is trading near or above NAV, which for a Tier B quality score requires a 25% discount. **No margin of safety exists at current levels.**

---

## Strengths (Bull Case)
1. Proven value-add model: buy at 82% occupancy, fill to 90%+
2. Internal platform = operational moat competitors lack
3. 12 consecutive dividend increases, well-covered by FFO (73% payout)
4. German SME market fragmented = acquisition runway
5. Low analyst coverage = potential for market inefficiency
6. Mid-term FFO target EUR 150M (22% upside from FY25)

## Weaknesses (Bear Case)
1. German commercial RE still under pressure post-rate cycle
2. Rising cost of debt: 2.5% WACOD will increase as old bonds roll off
3. Net LTV 38.3% leaves limited headroom for further acquisitions
4. Small cap, low liquidity, only 5 analysts
5. Business parks are secondary assets - vulnerable in downturn
6. FFO/share diluted by equity raises (grew 11.8% total but -5.7% per share in FY25)

---

## RECOMMENDATION: WATCHLIST (WAIT)

**Rationale**: Sirius is a well-run operator with a genuine operational edge in German business parks. The value-add model (buy underutilized, improve, fill vacancies) works and generates consistent FFO growth. However:

1. **No margin of safety**: At 98.25p, the stock trades at a 2% discount to NAV at best, vs the 25% MoS required for Tier B.
2. **Rising cost of debt**: The 2.5% WACOD is an artifact of cheap legacy debt. Refinancing at 4%+ will pressure FFO.
3. **FFO dilution**: Equity raises have diluted per-share metrics even as total FFO grew.

### Target Entry Price
To achieve 25% MoS on composite fair value of 90.7p:
- **Target entry: 68p (EUR 0.78)** = 25% below composite FV
- More aggressive: **75p (EUR 0.87)** = 17% below composite (borderline acceptable if thesis strengthens)

### Position Size (if entry achieved)
- Standard Value: 4% (EUR 400)
- Adjusted: -0.5% for RE sector overlap with VICI = **3.5% (EUR 350)**
- Total RE exposure would be ~8.4% (VICI 4.9% + SRE 3.5%) - within 25% sector limit

### Catalyst to Monitor
1. EUR 400M bond refinancing June 2026 - watch terms/cost
2. German occupancy trend (currently 77.2% - improving or deteriorating?)
3. FY2026 full year results (March 2026 year-end, reported ~June 2026)
4. Any price weakness below 80p = re-evaluate urgently

## Portfolio Fit Assessment
- Geographic diversification: YES - adds German RE vs US REIT (VICI)
- Sector diversification: PARTIAL - both are RE, but very different sub-sectors
- Correlation with VICI: LOW (German business parks vs US casino triple-net)
- Income contribution: Good - 5.4% yield, growing

**Conclusion**: Good portfolio fit IF price drops to entry zone. Not at current levels.

---

## Autocritique (Protocol 2 - Bias Check)
1. **Bias affecting me**: CONFIRMATION - the screening flagged SRE as attractive, tempting me to find reasons to buy. I actively searched for bear arguments.
2. **Contramedida**: Calculated fair value with 3 independent methods; all show stock is at or above fair value.
3. **Alternative ignored**: None - the conclusion is clear: wait for better price.
