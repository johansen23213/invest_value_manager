**Earnings Date**: February 5, 2026
**Prepared**: February 3, 2026
**Current Price**: 565.20 SEK

---

## Pre-Earnings Context

### Macro Environment (from world/current_view.md)
- Geopolitics: Iran-US tension HIGH, tariffs escalating
- Impact on EVO: MINIMAL - EVO is B2B digital services, not exposed to tariffs or commodity prices
- Gambling sector: Not mentioned as a focus in current macro view
- Risk: ESG/regulatory headwinds persist globally

### Position Status
- **Standing Order**: Trigger at 650 SEK, size EUR 400 (~7 shares)
- **Current Price**: 565.20 SEK - ALREADY 13% BELOW trigger
- **Decision Required**: BUY NOW or WAIT for earnings clarity?

### Key Metrics to Watch in Q4 Report
1. **Revenue growth YoY** (Q3 was -2.4% YoY - first decline)
2. **Asia revenue trend** (Q3 was -9.6% QoQ)
3. **Europe/US growth** (offsetting Asia?)
4. **UKGC investigation update** (license status, timeline)
5. **EBITDA margin** (Q3 was ~66%)
6. **Guidance for 2026**

---

## SCENARIO A: BEAR CASE

### Trigger Conditions
- Revenue miss: Q4 revenue <EUR 560M (Q3 was EUR 559M)
- Asia continues deteriorating: >-10% QoQ decline
- UKGC negative update: investigation escalating, potential conditions on license
- EBITDA margin compression: <60%
- No 2026 guidance or cautious outlook

### Probability
- **25%** (based on trend but UKGC update is binary risk)

### Expected Market Reaction
- Stock falls 15-25%: 425-480 SEK range
- P/E contracts to 7-8x

### Valuation Impact
- DCF Bear: 942 SEK (still 66% upside from 565)
- EV/EBITDA Bear: 712 SEK (26% upside from 565)
- P/E Bear: 786 SEK (39% upside from 565)
- **Bear Average: 813 SEK**

### Kill Conditions Check
| Condition | Q4 Bear Status | Breached? |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| UKGC license revoked | Escalating, not revoked | NO |
| Revenue declines 3+ consecutive quarters | Q3 was 1st decline, Q4 would be 2nd | NO |
| EBITDA margin <55% | Compressed to 58-60% | NO |

### ACTION IF BEAR MATERIALIZES

**DO NOT PANIC SELL. EVALUATE:**

1. **If UKGC license explicitly threatened/revoked**:
   - SELL IMMEDIATELY (thesis invalidated)
   - This is the only kill condition

2. **If revenue miss + Asia decline but UKGC stable**:
   - **HOLD position** (if already bought)
   - **BUY SMALL** (50% of intended size = EUR 200)
   - Rationale: Even Bear FV of 813 SEK = 44% upside from 565
   - Add remaining 50% after Q1 2026 if trend reverses

3. **If margin compression <60% but revenue stable**:
   - **HOLD** - one-quarter margin hit is noise
   - Investigate cause (investment in new studios? Competition pricing?)

**BEAR ACTION SUMMARY**:
| Sub-scenario | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| UKGC license at risk | SELL / DO NOT BUY |
| Revenue miss + Asia decline | BUY 50% (EUR 200), WAIT for Q1 |
| Margin compression only | BUY full (EUR 400) |

---

## SCENARIO B: BASE CASE

### Trigger Conditions
- Revenue inline: Q4 revenue EUR 560-580M (flat to +3% QoQ)
- Asia stabilizes: flat to -5% QoQ (improvement from -9.6%)
- UKGC neutral: "investigation ongoing, no material update"
- EBITDA margin: 64-67%
- Conservative 2026 guidance: low-single-digit growth

### Probability
- **50%**

### Expected Market Reaction
- Stock neutral to +5%: 565-595 SEK
- Relief rally possible if UKGC fears overdone

### Valuation Impact
- DCF Base: 1,163 SEK
- EV/EBITDA Base: 881 SEK
- P/E Base: 983 SEK
- **Base Average: 1,009 SEK** (MoS: 44% from 565)

### Kill Conditions Check
| Condition | Q4 Base Status | Breached? |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| UKGC license revoked | Investigation ongoing | NO |
| Revenue declines 3+ consecutive quarters | Q4 stable = only Q3 decline | NO |
| EBITDA margin <55% | 64-67% | NO |

### ACTION IF BASE MATERIALIZES

**BUY FULL POSITION (EUR 400)**

Rationale:
- 44% MoS far exceeds Tier B requirement (25%)
- Thesis intact: Wide moat, dominant position, 15% capital return
- UKGC risk priced in at 9.7x P/E
- No kill conditions breached
- Stock at 52-week low = buying when fearful

**Execution**:
- Human executes in eToro: BUY ~7 shares at market (~SEK 565)
- Estimated EUR cost: EUR 400 / 11.52 SEK/EUR = ~3,470 SEK = ~6 shares
- Adjust to EUR 400 equivalent at market price

---

## SCENARIO C: BULL CASE

### Trigger Conditions
- Revenue beat: Q4 revenue >EUR 590M (+5% QoQ)
- Asia stabilizes or recovers: >0% QoQ
- US/LatAm strong growth: double-digit
- UKGC positive: investigation closed or "no adverse findings expected"
- EBITDA margin: >67%
- Confident 2026 guidance: mid-single-digit growth, new market entries
- Buyback acceleration announced

### Probability
- **25%**

### Expected Market Reaction
- Stock rallies 15-25%: 650-700 SEK
- P/E re-rates to 11-12x

### Valuation Impact
- DCF Bull: 1,547 SEK
- EV/EBITDA Bull: 1,049 SEK
- P/E Bull: 1,179 SEK
- **Bull Average: 1,258 SEK** (MoS: 55% from 565)

### Kill Conditions Check
All conditions clearly NOT breached in bull scenario.

### ACTION IF BULL MATERIALIZES

**BUY FULL POSITION (EUR 400) IMMEDIATELY**

Rationale:
- Even at 650-700 SEK, MoS is still 30-35%
- UKGC risk removed = multiple re-rating catalyst
- Wait costs you the initial 15-25% rally

**CRITICAL**: If price gaps above 750 SEK before you can act:
- Reduce size to EUR 300 (MoS drops to ~25%)
- If gaps above 850 SEK: WAIT for pullback (MoS <15% = Tier A threshold only)

## PRE-EARNINGS DECISION FRAMEWORK

### Current Situation Analysis

| Factor | Status | Implication |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Price vs trigger | 565 << 650 | BUY trigger already exceeded |
| MoS current | 44% | Far above Tier B 25% requirement |
| Days to earnings | 2 | Binary event risk |
| UKGC uncertainty | HIGH | Main risk factor |
| Downside in Bear | 425-480 SEK | -16% to -25% from here |
| Upside in Base | 565-595 SEK | 0% to +5% |
| Upside in Bull | 650-700 SEK | +15% to +24% |

### Expected Value Calculation

```
EV = P(Bear) x Bear_Outcome + P(Base) x Base_Outcome + P(Bull) x Bull_Outcome

Price scenarios (midpoint):
- Bear: 450 SEK (25%)
- Base: 580 SEK (50%)
- Bull: 675 SEK (25%)

EV = 0.25 x 450 + 0.50 x 580 + 0.25 x 675
EV = 112.5 + 290 + 168.75
EV = 571.25 SEK

Current price: 565 SEK
Expected return: +1.1% on earnings
```

**Conclusion**: Expected value is slightly positive, but uncertainty is HIGH.

---

## RECOMMENDATION

### OPTION 1: WAIT UNTIL POST-EARNINGS (RECOMMENDED)

**Rationale**:
1. Binary UKGC risk is the key uncertainty
2. Expected value is only +1.1% - not compelling to take binary risk
3. Even if Bull materializes and stock goes to 675, MoS is still 33% - acceptable entry
4. If Bear materializes, can buy at 450 SEK with 54% MoS

**Action**:
- DO NOT BUY before Feb 5 earnings
- Monitor earnings call for UKGC update
- Execute post-earnings based on scenario that materializes

### OPTION 2: BUY HALF NOW, HALF POST-EARNINGS

**Rationale**:
1. Price is already 13% below original trigger
2. 44% MoS provides significant buffer even in Bear
3. Reduces timing risk (missing Bull rally)
4. Diversifies entry points

**Action**:
- BUY EUR 200 (~3 shares) NOW
- Reserve EUR 200 for post-earnings
- Add in Bear (if no kill conditions) or Base/Bull

### OPTION 3: BUY FULL NOW

**Rationale**:
1. Conviction in thesis is high
2. 44% MoS exceeds requirements significantly
3. Even Bear FV of 813 SEK = 44% upside
4. Waiting has opportunity cost if Bull materializes

**Action**:
- BUY EUR 400 (~7 shares) NOW
- Accept binary earnings risk
- Set mental stop if UKGC license revoked

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**WAIT UNTIL AFTER EARNINGS (Option 1)**

Primary reason: **The UKGC outcome is the one kill condition that would invalidate the entire thesis.** Buying before knowing the UKGC status is taking unnecessary binary risk when the expected value is only +1.1%.

### Post-Earnings Decision Tree

```
Q4 Earnings Released (Feb 5)
           |
     UKGC Update?
    /            \

           (200 EUR)   BUY FULL
           add later   (400 EUR)
```

### Human Instructions for Feb 5

1. **Watch for earnings release** (typically pre-market Europe)
2. **Key things to check**:
   - Press release: Search for "UKGC", "investigation", "license", "Gambling Commission"
   - Revenue: Compare to EUR 559M (Q3) - want >=560M
   - Asia segment: Compare to -9.6% QoQ (Q3) - want improvement
   - EBITDA margin: Want >=64%
3. **If UKGC license at risk**: DO NOT BUY
4. **If UKGC stable + revenue inline**: BUY EUR 400 at market
5. **If UKGC stable + revenue miss**: BUY EUR 200, reserve EUR 200
