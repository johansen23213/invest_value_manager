## SECTION 1: BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING (Business Analysis Framework)

### 1.1 What Problem Does Evolution Solve?

**Problem**: Online gambling operators need live casino content to compete. Live casino (real dealers streaming games) is the highest-engagement, highest-GGR segment of iGaming. Building and operating live casino studios requires:
- Massive capital (studios, technology, dealers)
- Regulatory licenses in 20+ jurisdictions
- Deep technical integration expertise
- Constant game innovation (100+ new titles/year)

**Solution**: Evolution provides B2B live casino as a service. Operators integrate Evolution's API and get instant access to 300+ live tables, 374 game titles (2024), and coverage in 20+ jurisdictions. Evolution handles all the complexity; operators pay ~10% of GGR.

**Must-have or nice-to-have?** MUST-HAVE. Evolution content is "table stakes" for any serious online casino operator. In regulated US states, Evolution has ~90% share - operators literally cannot compete without it.

### 1.2 Revenue Model

| Type | % Revenue | Characteristics |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| Live Casino (B2B) | 85-90% | Revenue share (~10% of operator GGR). Recurring, scales with operator volume |
| RNG Games (NetEnt, Red Tiger) | 10-15% | From acquisitions. Transaction-based but recurring |

**Revenue Quality**:
- High visibility: long-term operator contracts
- High retention: switching costs are massive (technical integration, re-licensing)
- Organic growth: as iGaming legalizes in new markets, TAM expands

### 1.3 Unit Economics (CRITICAL)

Evolution's B2B model doesn't have traditional CAC/LTV, but we can analyze per-table economics:

```
Revenue per table: ~EUR 750K/year (approximation based on 300 tables, EUR 2.2B revenue)
Cost per table: ~EUR 250K/year (studio cost + dealers + technology)
Gross margin per table: ~EUR 500K = 66% (matches reported EBITDA margin)

Marginal cost of adding table: LOW (incremental dealers, minimal capex)
Operating leverage: VERY HIGH (fixed studio costs, variable revenue)
```

**Key insight**: Once a studio is built, incremental tables and operators add minimal cost. This explains 66% EBITDA margins.

### 1.4 Margin Structure and Trend

| Metric | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | Q1-Q3 2025 | Trend |
|--------|------|------|------|------------|-------|
| Revenue Growth | +35% | +18% | +15% | +2% | Decelerating |
| Gross Margin | ~95% | ~95% | ~95% | ~95% | Stable |
| EBITDA Margin | 69% | 68% | 68% | 66-67% | Slight compression |
| Net Margin | 52% | 51% | 50% | 48% | Compressing |
| FCF Margin | 60% | 60% | 55% | 55% | Stable |

**Concerning trend**: Revenue growth decelerated from +35% (2022) to +2% (2025 YTD). Asia decline (-10% QoQ in Q3) is dragging overall growth. EBITDA margin held at 66-67% but net margin compressing due to higher taxes (Swedish tax authority investigations resolved but higher going-forward rate).

### 1.5 Capital Requirements

**Asset-light model**:
- Capex: ~EUR 50-60M/year (2-3% of revenue) for studio expansion
- Working capital: Negative (cash collected before paid to suppliers)
- No significant debt needs
- Cash: EUR 787M (Jan 2026), essentially debt-free

**FCF conversion**: ~80-85% of EBITDA converts to FCF. Exceptional.

---

## SECTION 2: WHY IS IT CHEAP? (CRITICAL)

### 2.1 Market Narrative

The market believes:

1. **UKGC investigation is serious** - First-ever Section 116 review of a B2B live casino supplier. Could result in license revocation.
2. **Asia is structurally impaired** - Grey market crackdowns in Philippines, Thailand, China. Permanent TAM shrinkage.
3. **Growth is over** - Revenue declined 2.4% YoY in Q3 2025. First decline in company history.
4. **Competition is intensifying** - Pragmatic Play gaining share in LatAm/Asia with lower-cost offerings.
5. **CFO departure is a red flag** - Jacob Kaplan left in Jan 2025 amid regulatory scrutiny.

### 2.2 My Counter-Thesis

| Market Believes | I Believe | Evidence | Prob I'm Wrong |
|-----------------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| UKGC will revoke license | UKGC likely results in fine/conditions, not revocation | UK is only 3% revenue; Evolution already implemented corrective measures; B2B suppliers rarely get licenses revoked; UKGC has financial incentive to fine, not revoke | 25% |
| Asia decline is permanent | Asia will stabilize at lower level; US/LatAm growth offsets | Q3 was worst quarter; grey-to-white transitions stabilize; US growing 23% YoY; Brazil just legalized | 40% |
| Growth is over | Growth returns to mid-single-digits in 2026 | US legalization continues; Brazil (largest LatAm market) opened Jan 2025; Europe stable | 30% |
| Pragmatic Play threatens dominance | Evolution maintains 55-60% share; premium positioning defensible | Pragmatic targets budget segment; Evolution's 374 titles vs Pragmatic's 140; switching costs protect existing base | 25% |
| CFO departure signals trouble | Departure unrelated to investigation; successor appointed | Kaplan had been CFO since 2016 (9 years); natural turnover; Joakim Andersson is internal promotion | 20% |

### 2.3 Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | Status | Comment |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Industry in secular decline | **NO** | iGaming growing 8-11% annually; live casino fastest segment |
| Imminent technological disruption | NO | AI/VR enhances live casino, doesn't replace it |
| Management destroying value | NO | Capital allocation excellent (buybacks + dividends at 15% yield) |
| Balance deteriorating | NO | Net cash EUR 700M+, debt-free |
| Insider selling >5% in 12m | **PARTIAL** | CFO departure concerning but not mass selling |
| Dividend cut recent/probable | NO | Dividend increased, payout ratio sustainable at 51% |
| Market share loss >2pp in 3y | **PARTIAL** | Share stable in Europe/US; losing in Asia to Pragmatic |
| ROIC < WACC last 3 years | NO | ROE 30%, ROIC ~35-40%, well above WACC |
| FCF negative 2+ years | NO | FCF EUR 1.2B+ annually, growing |
| Goodwill >50% equity | NO | Goodwill from NetEnt but <30% equity |

**Value Trap Score: 1-2/10** - NOT a value trap. Core business is excellent. Regulatory risk is the key issue.

### 2.4 My Informational Advantage

- **Longer time horizon**: Market is pricing in UKGC disaster; I can wait 12-18 months for resolution
- **Quantitative analysis**: At 10x FCF, even Bear case (flat growth forever) justifies current price
- **Behavioral over-reaction**: Stock down 35% from peak on 3% UK revenue exposure

---

## SECTION 3: PROJECTION (Projection Framework)

### 3.1 TAM Analysis

**Global iGaming Market**:
- 2025 size: ~$110B (online gambling only)
- Growth rate: 8-11% CAGR
- Live casino: ~$15-20B, growing faster than overall at 12-15%

**Evolution's Addressable Market**:
- B2B live casino: ~$15B GGR
- Evolution takes ~10% revenue share = ~$1.5B addressable today
- TAM growing with legalization (US states, Brazil, Germany regulation clarity)

**TAM Growth Drivers**:
- US legalization: only ~10 states live, 40+ could legalize
- Brazil: just opened Jan 2025, largest LatAm market
- Africa: emerging market, Pragmatic strong but Evolution entering
- India: large potential, currently grey market

**TAM Growth Risks**:
- Asia grey market shrinkage (permanent TAM loss)
- EU regulation tightening (stake limits, affordability checks)

**Conservative TAM Growth**: 6-8% annually (below industry consensus due to Asia headwinds)

### 3.2 Market Share Analysis

| Region | 2023 Share | 2025 Share | Trend | Projection 2028 |
|--------|------------|------------|-------|-----------------|
| Europe | 60-70% | 55-65% | Stable/slight loss | 50-60% |
| North America | 85-90% | 85-90% | Stable (dominant) | 80-85% |
| Asia | 50-60% | 40-50% | LOSING to Pragmatic | 35-45% |
| Latin America | 30-40% | 35-45% | GAINING (Brazil entry) | 40-50% |
| Global | 60-65% | 55-60% | Slight erosion | 50-55% |

**Net effect**: Global share erodes 1-2pp/year but TAM growth offsets, resulting in low-single-digit revenue growth.

### 3.3 Pricing Power Analysis

**Evidence of pricing power**:
- Operators cannot easily switch (technical integration)
- Evolution content is "must-have" for competitive positioning
- No significant price pressure despite Pragmatic competition (Pragmatic targets budget, Evolution targets premium)

**Pricing power score**: MODERATE
- Can likely maintain pricing with inflation (2-3%)
- Unlikely to significantly increase take rate without operator pushback

**Projection**: 2% annual pricing contribution

### 3.4 Revenue Growth Formula

```
Revenue Growth = TAM Growth + Delta Market Share + Pricing

TAM Growth: +7% (conservative, below consensus)
Market Share: -1.5pp/year (erosion in Asia, offset by US/LatAm gains = slight net negative)
Pricing: +2%

= Net Revenue Growth: ~5-6% annually

Bear Case: 3% (TAM slows, share loss accelerates)
Base Case: 6% (TAM stable, share stabilizes)
Bull Case: 10% (US accelerates, Asia stabilizes, Brazil exceeds)
```

### 3.5 Margin Projection

| Scenario | EBITDA Margin | Rationale |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| Bear | 63% | Competition forces pricing, higher dealer costs |
| Base | 66% | Current level sustained, operating leverage |
| Bull | 68% | Asia stabilizes (higher margin), operating leverage |

### 3.6 WACC Derivation

```
Risk-Free Rate (Rf): 3.5% (10Y US Treasury proxy)
Equity Risk Premium (ERP): 5.5% (standard)
Beta: 1.04 (Yahoo Finance)
Cost of Equity (Ke): 3.5% + 1.04 * 5.5% = 9.2%

Cost of Debt (Kd): N/A (debt-free)
Tax Rate: 21%

Capital Structure:
  Market Cap: EUR 10B
  Net Debt: -EUR 700M (net cash)
  Enterprise Value: EUR 9.3B
  Weight Equity: 100% (essentially all equity)

WACC = 9.2%

REGULATORY RISK PREMIUM: Given UKGC investigation, add +1% risk premium

ADJUSTED WACC = 10.2%, round to 10%
```

### 3.7 Terminal Value

**Can Evolution grow forever at X%?**

Terminal growth: 2.5%
- iGaming is secular growth industry (digitization of gambling)
- Evolution dominant position likely sustains some growth
- Conservative vs industry (10%+) due to competition

## SECTION 4: VALUATION (Multi-Method)

### Method 1: DCF

**Assumptions**:
- Base FCF: EUR 1.2B (2024)
- Growth: 6% years 1-5, 4% years 6-10, 2.5% terminal
- WACC: 10%
- Shares: 199M

**DCF Calculation**:
```
Year    FCF(EUR M)    PV Factor    PV(EUR M)
1       1,272         0.909        1,156
2       1,348         0.826        1,114
3       1,429         0.751        1,073
4       1,515         0.683        1,035
5       1,606         0.621        997
6       1,670         0.564        942
7       1,737         0.513        891
8       1,806         0.467        843
9       1,879         0.424        797
10      1,954         0.386        754

Sum PV FCF: EUR 9,602M

Terminal Value: 1,954 * 1.025 / (0.10 - 0.025) = EUR 26,708M
PV Terminal: 26,708 * 0.386 = EUR 10,309M

Enterprise Value: 9,602 + 10,309 = EUR 19,911M
+ Net Cash: EUR 700M
Equity Value: EUR 20,611M

Fair Value per Share: EUR 20,611M / 199M = EUR 103.6 = 1,193 SEK
```

**DCF Fair Values by Scenario**:
| Scenario | Growth | WACC | Fair Value (SEK) |
|----------|--------|------|------------------|
| Bear | 3% | 11% | 750 |
| Base | 6% | 10% | 1,193 |
| Bull | 10% | 9% | 1,650 |

### Method 2: EV/EBITDA Comparables

**Peers**:
| Company | EV/EBITDA | Growth | EBITDA Margin | Notes |
|---------|-----------|--------|---------------|-------|
| Flutter (FLUT) | 14x | 12% | 22% | B2C, lower margin |
| Entain (ENT.L) | 7x | 5% | 20% | B2C, troubled |
| Playtech (PTEC) | 8x | 4% | 28% | B2B competitor |

**Evolution characteristics**:
- EBITDA Margin: 66% (best-in-class)
- Growth: 6% (moderate)
- ROIC: 35%+ (exceptional)

**Appropriate multiple**: 10-12x EV/EBITDA (premium to Playtech due to margins, discount to Flutter due to B2B and regulatory risk)

**Calculation**:
```
EBITDA (2024): EUR 1.45B
Multiple: 11x (midpoint)
EV: EUR 15.95B
- Net Debt: -EUR 0.7B (add cash)
Equity: EUR 16.65B
Fair Value: EUR 83.7 = 964 SEK
```

| Scenario | Multiple | Fair Value (SEK) |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| Bear | 8x | 650 |
| Base | 11x | 964 |
| Bull | 14x | 1,280 |

### Method 3: P/E Normalized

**Current P/E**: 9.7x
**Peers**: Flutter 22x, Entain N/A (loss), Playtech 12x

**Appropriate P/E**: 12-15x (B2B, high margin, but regulatory risk)

**Calculation**:
```
EPS (TTM): EUR 5.68
Multiple: 14x (midpoint)
Fair Value: EUR 79.5 = 916 SEK
```

| Scenario | Multiple | Fair Value (SEK) |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| Bear | 10x | 655 |
| Base | 14x | 916 |
| Bull | 18x | 1,177 |

### Valuation Reconciliation

| Method | Weight | Bear | Base | Bull |
|--------|--------|------|------|------|
| DCF | 40% | 750 | 1,193 | 1,650 |
| EV/EBITDA | 35% | 650 | 964 | 1,280 |
| P/E | 25% | 655 | 916 | 1,177 |
| **Weighted** | 100% | **693** | **1,048** | **1,407** |

**Adjustment for Regulatory Risk**: Given UKGC uncertainty, apply 10% haircut to account for option-value loss scenarios.

| Scenario | Pre-Haircut | Post-Haircut |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Bear | 693 | 600 |
| Base | 1,048 | 950 |
| Bull | 1,407 | 1,250 |

### Expected Value Calculation

```
EV = (Bear * 25%) + (Base * 50%) + (Bull * 25%)
EV = (600 * 0.25) + (950 * 0.50) + (1,250 * 0.25)
EV = 150 + 475 + 312.5
EV = 937.5 SEK, round to 940 SEK

Current Price: 564 SEK
MoS vs Expected Value: (940 - 564) / 940 = 40%
MoS vs Bear: (600 - 564) / 600 = 6%
```

## SECTION 5: MOAT ASSESSMENT

### Moat Matrix

| Source | Present | Strength (1-5) | Evidence | Durability |
|--------|---------|----------------|----------|------------|
| Cost Advantage | YES | 4 | 66% EBITDA margin vs 20-25% for B2C; operating leverage from scale | 10+ years |
| Network Effects | PARTIAL | 2 | Operators integrate once, rarely switch; but not true network effect (more operators doesn't make Evolution better) | 10 years |
| Intangibles | YES | 4 | Licenses in 20+ jurisdictions; 300+ patents; brand as "gold standard" | 15+ years |
| Switching Costs | YES | 5 | Technical integration takes 6-12 months; re-licensing required; operators rarely switch | 15+ years |
| Efficient Scale | YES | 3 | First-mover in regulated markets; expensive for new entrants to match scale | 10 years |

**Total Sources**: 4-5/5
**Average Strength**: 3.6/5

### ROIC vs WACC Test

```
ROIC (5-year average): ~35%
WACC: 10%
Spread: +25pp

ROIC has been consistently >WACC for 10+ years
```

### Moat Classification: **WIDE** (but under regulatory threat)

**Conclusion**: Evolution has a Wide Moat based on switching costs, intangibles (licenses), and cost advantage. However, the UKGC investigation introduces uncertainty. If licenses cascade-fail, moat erodes rapidly.

**Moat Durability**: 10-15 years if regulatory resolves favorably; could narrow to 5 years if cascade.

## SECTION 6: RISK ASSESSMENT

### Top 5 Risks (Prob x Impact)

| # | Risk | Prob | Impact | Score | Mitigation |
|---|------|------|--------|-------|------------|
| 1 | **UKGC license revocation** | 15% | VERY HIGH | CRITICAL | UK = 3% revenue but precedent could trigger cascade. Evolution cooperating, implemented fixes. Monitor Feb 5 for update. |
| 2 | **Regulatory cascade (EU-wide review)** | 20% | HIGH | HIGH | UKGC action could trigger Malta, Sweden reviews. Evolution claims competitor (Playtech/Black Cube) orchestrated smear. |
| 3 | **Asia structural decline continues** | 40% | MEDIUM | HIGH | Grey market crackdowns permanent. Offset by US/LatAm. Partially priced in. |
| 4 | **Competition erosion (Pragmatic)** | 25% | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Pragmatic gaining in budget segment. Evolution's premium positioning defensible but share eroding at edges. |
| 5 | **Single product concentration** | 30% | LOW-MED | MEDIUM | Live casino = 85% revenue. RNG diversification exists (NetEnt, Red Tiger) but limited. |

### Scenario Analysis

| Scenario | Probability | Key Assumptions | Fair Value | Price Impact |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| **Bear** | 25% | UKGC escalates, cascade review, Asia continues declining, growth 0-3% | 600 SEK | +6% from current |
| **Base** | 50% | UKGC fine/conditions, Asia stabilizes, US/LatAm grow, 5-6% growth | 950 SEK | +68% from current |
| **Bull** | 25% | UKGC resolves cleanly, US legalization accelerates, Asia recovers, 8-10% growth | 1,250 SEK | +122% from current |

### Kill Conditions (Immediate Sell Triggers)

1. UKGC revokes Evolution's license
2. Any other major jurisdiction (Malta, Sweden) revokes/suspends license
3. Revenue declines >5% for 3 consecutive quarters
4. EBITDA margin falls below 55%
5. Dividend cut
6. Management fraud/governance scandal confirmed

---

## SECTION 7: CATALYSTS AND TIMELINE

| Date | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Feb 5, 2026** | Q4 2025 earnings | **CRITICAL** - Asia trend, UKGC update, guidance |
| H1 2026 | UKGC investigation outcome | Binary risk. Could resolve or escalate. |
| Q1-Q2 2026 | Brazil revenue ramp | Brazil legalized Jan 2025. First major regulated LatAm market. |
| 2026 ongoing | US state legalizations | Each new state adds TAM. Evolution has ~90% share in regulated US. |
| 2026 ongoing | Share buyback (EUR 500M) | Supports price, signals management confidence |

---

## SECTION 8: MACRO CONTEXT FIT

**From world/current_view.md (2026-02-02)**:

| Factor | Impact on EVO |
|--------|---------------|
| Interest rates (Fed/ECB stable) | Neutral. Evolution is growth company but doesn't rely on cheap capital. |
| Recession risk | LOW impact. Gambling is relatively recession-resistant (people gamble in good and bad times). |
| Geopolitics (Iran-US, tariffs) | MINIMAL direct exposure. iGaming is service-based, not physical trade. |
| Sector rotation (Tech odiado?) | Evolution is "Tech" but trades at value multiple. Not lumped with growth tech. |

**Macro fit**: FAVORABLE. Evolution is not exposed to major macro risks. Main risk is regulatory, which is company-specific.

---

## SECTION 9: AUTOCRITIQUE

### Biases Detected

1. **Anchoring to historical performance**: Evolution historically grew 20%+. I may be over-optimistic on 6% base case growth given Q3 -2.4% YoY decline.
2. **Underweighting regulatory risk**: UKGC Section 116 review is unprecedented. My 15% probability of revocation may be too low.
3. **Overweighting management assurances**: Evolution claims "corrective measures implemented" but we have no visibility.

### Key Assumptions That Could Be Wrong

1. **Asia stabilizes**: If Asia continues declining 10%/quarter, thesis fails.
2. **UKGC fine is manageable**: If UKGC revokes or triggers cascade, fair value is <500 SEK.
3. **US growth continues**: If US legalization stalls, growth engine disappears.

### What Could I Be Missing?

- **Insider knowledge**: CFO departed amid investigation. Is there something management knows that we don't?
- **Operator defections**: Are large operators quietly negotiating with Pragmatic?
- **Tax investigations**: Swedish tax authority issues resolved but ongoing compliance scrutiny.

### Confidence Level

**Overall confidence: 65%**

Higher confidence post-Feb 5 earnings if:
- UKGC provides clarity (fine, conditions, no revocation)
- Asia shows signs of stabilization
- Management provides confident guidance
