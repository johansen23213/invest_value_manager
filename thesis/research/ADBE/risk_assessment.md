## Top 3 Riesgos Criticos

### 1. ARR Deceleration and Flat Net-New ARR Guidance

- **Categoria:** Fundamental
- **Descripcion:** Adobe's ARR growth has decelerated sequentially every quarter of FY2025: Q1 12.3% -> Q2 11.8% -> Q3 11.7% -> Q4 11.5%. FY2026 guidance of 10.2% ARR growth continues this downtrend. KeyBanc cited "flat net-new ARR" as the primary reason for their downgrade to Underweight with a $310 target. This is the single most important metric for a SaaS business, and the trend is unmistakably negative.
- **Evidencia:**
  - FY2026 ARR guidance: 10.2% growth ($2.6B net new) vs FY2025 11.5%
  - KeyBanc downgrade to Underweight ($310 PT) citing flat net-new ARR
  - Piper Sandler downgrade to Neutral ($330 PT)
  - Oppenheimer downgrade citing "decelerating top-line growth and down YoY operating margin guidance"
  - 5 major downgrades in 2025-2026: Morgan Stanley, KeyBanc, Piper Sandler, Jefferies, Oppenheimer
- **Probabilidad:** Alta -- the deceleration is already happening, it is a fact, not a prediction
- **Impacto si materializa:** If ARR growth drops below 8%, the market will price Adobe at 12-14x earnings permanently. At $16.6 EPS (FY2025) x 12x = $199 per share. That is a further -26% downside from current $268. If growth stabilizes at 10%, fair value is more defensible.
- **Mitigante:** Firefly AI features, generative credit consumption tripling QoQ, freemium users growing 35% YoY to 70M. These are leading indicators that COULD re-accelerate growth, but have not yet translated into net-new ARR acceleration.
- **Kill condition?:** YES -- If ARR growth drops below 7% for 2 consecutive quarters, the "growth compounder" thesis is invalid. This should be added to the thesis.

### 2. Thesis Fair Value Likely Inflated (Adversarial Valuation Check)

- **Categoria:** Valoracion
- **Descripcion:** The thesis claims FV of $394 weighted ($430 OEY method at 60% weight, $340 DCF at 40% weight). My independent analysis finds this is inflated by 15-25%, consistent with the adversarial review pattern found in 12 of 13 prior positions (average inflation ~15%).
- **Evidencia for inflation:**
  - **OEY method ($430):** Uses 5.5% target OEY. But for a business with decelerating growth, 5.5% is too generous. A 6.5-7% OEY is more appropriate for a company where 5 analysts have downgraded in 6 months. At 6.5% OEY: FV = $9.73B / 0.065 / 410.5M shares = $365. At 7% OEY: FV = $339.
  - **DCF tool output ($421 base):** Uses 9% default WACC. The thesis correctly derives 12% WACC, giving $340. However, the thesis then weights the $430 OEY at 60%, pulling the weighted average UP. The DCF at 12% WACC is the more rigorous number.
  - **Reverse DCF reality check:** At $268, the market prices in ~4% perpetual growth. Adobe's actual growth is 10% but DECELERATING. The question is where it stabilizes. If 7-8%, fair value is $300-323. If it decelerates further to 5-6%, fair value is $275-299.
  - **Wall Street consensus:** Mean PT $419-432, but this includes stale targets from pre-downgrade analysts. Post-downgrade targets cluster around $310-400.
  - **Bear case too optimistic:** Thesis bear is $260 at 4% growth, 13% WACC, 2% terminal. But a true bear case would include margin compression from AI investment AND growth below 5%. A realistic bear: $220-240.
- **My adjusted fair value:** $310-340 (range), with $325 as central estimate. This represents a -17% haircut from thesis $394.
- **MoS at $268 vs my adjusted FV ($325):** 17.5% -- still positive but much thinner than thesis claimed 31%.
- **Probabilidad:** Alta -- every prior adversarial review found thesis FV inflated
- **Impacto si materializa:** The position was purchased at $270.60 avg. If true FV is $325, upside is 20% (acceptable but not exceptional). If true FV is $310, upside is only 15%. If bear case materializes ($220-240), downside is -11% to -18%.
- **Mitigante:** The stock is at $268, near 52w low of $264. Much of the bad news may be priced in. Even at my lower FV estimate, there is positive MoS.
- **Kill condition?:** NO -- the position is small (2 shares, ~4.7%) and even at my lower FV there is positive upside. But the thesis FV should be revised downward.

### 3. Multi-Front Legal Exposure (FTC + AI Copyright)

- **Categoria:** Legal/Regulatorio
- **Descripcion:** Adobe faces two distinct legal threats that the thesis barely mentions:
  - **FTC/DOJ lawsuit** over deceptive subscription practices (hidden early termination fees, difficult cancellation). A federal judge denied Adobe's motion to dismiss in May 2025. The FTC seeks permanent injunction and civil penalties. A class action for damages is also pending.
  - **AI copyright class-action** (December 2025) alleging Adobe used pirated books (via SlimPajama/Books3 datasets) to train its SlimLM model. This is Adobe's first major AI copyright challenge and could undermine its "commercially safe" AI narrative -- the very differentiator that gives Firefly its enterprise advantage.
- **Evidencia:**
  - FTC case: Judge Noel Wise ruled in May 2025 that cancellation process is "far from simple." Case proceeding to discovery/trial.
  - AI copyright: Proposed class action filed Dec 2025 by author Elizabeth Lyon. Anthropic settled similar suit for $1.5B.
  - One Adobe executive allegedly described the early termination fee as "like heroin" for retention.
  - If FTC wins, "one-click cancellation" mandate could spike churn among casual users.
- **Probabilidad:** Media-Alta (FTC case has survived dismissal; AI copyright is early stage but industry trend is plaintiff-favorable)
- **Impacto si materializa:**
  - FTC: Settlement of $500M-1B + mandatory changes to subscription practices. If forced "one-click cancellation" increases churn by 3-5pp, revenue impact = $700M-1.2B annually (3-5% of revenue). Stock impact: -10-15%.
  - AI copyright: If courts rule that training weights "encode infringing copies," Adobe may need to retrain models or pay licensing fees. Could cost $500M-2B. More importantly, it DESTROYS the "commercially safe" narrative that differentiates Firefly from Midjourney.
  - Combined worst case: -20-25% stock impact.
- **Mitigante:** FTC case may settle for modest amount. AI copyright law is unsettled; Adobe can argue fair use. Firefly was primarily trained on Adobe Stock (licensed content), not SlimLM.
- **Kill condition?:** YES (conditional) -- If AI copyright ruling mandates that Firefly itself (not just SlimLM) used infringing training data, this kills the "commercially safe AI" moat. Monitor closely.

## Riesgos NO Mencionados en Thesis

| Riesgo | Severidad | Mencionado en thesis? | Comentario |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|------------|
| FTC/DOJ subscription lawsuit (survived dismissal) | HIGH | NO | Thesis mentions zero legal risks. A federal lawsuit against the CEO and executives is material. |
| AI copyright class-action (SlimLM) | HIGH | NO | Filed Dec 2025, directly threatens "commercially safe AI" narrative |
| ARR deceleration as TREND (not one-time) | HIGH | Minimizado | Thesis says "Growth stable at 7-8%" but actual trend is decelerating every quarter |
| Figma IPO as competitive catalyst | MEDIUM | Minimizado | Thesis dismisses Figma as "different market" but Figma has 80-90% share in UI/UX design and 38% revenue growth |
| Enterprise budget shifting from front-office to AI infra | MEDIUM | NO | CIO survey shows 16-point net decrease in sales/marketing budgets |
| Digital Experience segment competitive pressure | MEDIUM | NO | 24% of revenue competing with Salesforce, Oracle, SAP in a commoditizing market |
| Adobe XD abandoned, ceding UI/UX to Figma | MEDIUM | NO | Adobe shelved XD in 2023, effectively conceding the UI/UX design category |
| "One-click cancellation" churn risk from FTC | MEDIUM | NO | If mandated, could increase casual user churn 3-5pp |
| Insider net selling $17M vs $1.5M buying | LOW | Mentioned as "no selling" | Thesis says "sin ventas masivas" but insiders sold 10x what they bought |
| Operating margin guidance DOWN YoY in FY26 | MEDIUM | NO | Oppenheimer cited this as reason for downgrade |
| Canva AI + Penpot (open source) low-end disruption | MEDIUM | Minimizado | Thesis dismisses Canva; does not mention Penpot at all |

**Total risks NOT in thesis or minimized: 11**

## Quality Score Reassessment

The thesis assigns QS 76/100 (Tier A). My independent assessment:

| Categoria | Thesis | My Assessment | Delta | Reasoning |
|-----------|--------|---------------|-------|-----------|
| Financial Quality | 36/40 | 34/40 | -2 | ROIC spread thesis says +17pp, tool says +11.3pp. Use tool value. Dock 2 pts for inconsistency. |
| Growth Quality | 18/25 | 15/25 | -3 | Revenue CAGR 7.8% is DECELERATING (was 10%+ two years ago). EPS growth 13.4% supported by buybacks, not organic. Dock for deceleration trajectory. |
| Moat Evidence | 22/25 | 19/25 | -3 | Adobe XD abandoned (ceded UI/UX), Figma at 38% YoY growth, 5 analyst downgrades signal moat erosion. GM premium still strong but market position weakening. |
| Capital Allocation | 0/10 | 0/10 | 0 | Unchanged. 0.2% insider ownership is genuinely poor alignment. |
| **TOTAL** | **76** | **68** | **-8** | **Tier B, not Tier A** |

**Significance:** If QS is 68 (Tier B), the thesis requires higher MoS (~20-25% per precedents). My adjusted FV of $325 provides only 17.5% MoS at $268 -- borderline insufficient for Tier B.

## Valuation Risk Assessment

### Thesis FV vs My Assessment

| Method | Thesis | My Estimate | Delta | Key Differences |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------|-----------------|
| OEY | $430 (5.5% yield) | $339-365 (6.5-7%) | -15 to -21% | Higher required yield for decelerating business |
| DCF (12% WACC) | $340 | $300-323 | -5 to -12% | Growth 6-7% (lower, reflecting deceleration trend) |
| Weighted FV | $394 | $310-340 | -14 to -21% | |
| Bear Case | $260 | $220-240 | -8 to -15% | Thesis bear is too shallow |
| Bull Case | $520 | $420-460 | -12 to -19% | |

**Central Estimate: $325** (vs thesis $394, a -17% haircut)

### DCF Sensitivity

The DCF tool with default 9% WACC outputs $421 base FV. This is misleading for ADBE because:
- Adobe's beta is 1.51, well above market
- WACC derived from first principles = 12.1%
- Using 9% WACC overstates FV by ~24%

The thesis correctly uses 12% WACC for its own DCF ($340), but then weights the OEY method at 60% to arrive at $394. The OEY method itself uses a generous 5.5% target yield that is inappropriate for a decelerating business facing 5 analyst downgrades.

### Current Price Context

- Price: $268.38 (Feb 9, 2026)
- 52w Low: $264.04 (only 1.6% above)
- 52w High: $465.70 (down 42%)
- Analyst consensus mean PT: ~$419-432
- Lowest analyst PT: $280 (close to current price)
- KeyBanc PT: $310 (Underweight)

At $268, the stock is priced at 16.1x trailing P/E. This implies the market is pricing in significant headwinds. The question is whether the market is RIGHT (growth decelerates further, moat erodes) or WRONG (AI re-accelerates growth).

---

## Kill Conditions Sugeridas

In addition to the 5 kill conditions already in the thesis, I suggest adding:

1. **ARR growth drops below 7% for 2 consecutive quarters** -- this would mean the "growth compounder" thesis is invalid and Adobe is transitioning to a mature, low-growth business. At that point, a 16x P/E is not cheap; it is fair or expensive.

2. **FTC ruling mandates "one-click cancellation" AND churn increases above 12%** -- the current sub-10% churn is critical to the valuation. If the FTC forces easier cancellation and churn jumps, the revenue base deteriorates.

3. **AI copyright ruling finds Firefly training data includes infringing material** -- this would destroy the "commercially safe AI" moat that differentiates Adobe from Midjourney/Stable Diffusion. Enterprise customers would lose confidence.

4. **Operating margin contracts below 33% for 2 consecutive quarters** -- Oppenheimer flagged "down YoY operating margin guidance" for FY26. If margin compression becomes a trend (not a one-quarter investment), it signals the business model is under pressure.

5. **Figma captures >15% of Creative Cloud's professional user base** -- this would signal that the "different market" thesis is wrong and Figma is directly taking Adobe's core customers.

## Riesgo Agregado

- Numero de riesgos HIGH+CRITICAL: **7** (2 CRITICAL + 5 HIGH)
- Riesgos correlacionados? **SI**
  - Risks #1 (ARR deceleration), #6 (DX stagnation), #8 (enterprise budget cuts), and #14 (low-end pressure) are correlated: they all reflect a SINGLE underlying theme of Adobe's growth engine slowing. If enterprise budgets tighten AND low-end competitors capture more share AND ARR decelerates, the combined effect is multiplicative, not additive.
  - Risks #4 (FTC lawsuit) and churn risk are correlated: if FTC wins, churn increases, which worsens ARR deceleration.
  - Risk #5 (AI copyright) and #3 (AI unbundling) are correlated: both attack Adobe's AI narrative from different angles.

**Risk Score Final: HIGH**

Justification: 7 HIGH/CRITICAL risks is well above the 5-risk threshold for HIGH. Two risks are CRITICAL. Multiple risks are correlated (amplifying effect). The thesis missed 11 risks entirely. QS is likely overstated by 8 points (Tier B, not Tier A). The FV is likely inflated by ~17%.

However, this is NOT "VERY HIGH" because:
- Adobe has genuine competitive advantages (89% gross margin, 41% FCF margin, net cash position)
- The stock is near 52w low, meaning much bad news is priced in
- The position is very small (2 shares, ~4.7% of portfolio)
- Even at my adjusted FV ($325), there is positive upside (~21%)
- Firefly/AI adoption metrics are strong leading indicators (70M freemium users, 3x credit consumption growth)

## Summary for Orchestrator

| Metric | Thesis | Adversarial Assessment |
|--------|--------|----------------------|
| Quality Score | 76 (Tier A) | 68 (Tier B) |
| Fair Value | $394 | $325 |
| MoS at $268 | 31% | 17.5% |
| Bear Case | $260 | $220-240 |
| Risk Score | Not assessed | HIGH |
| Kill Conditions | 5 | 10 (5 original + 5 new) |
| Risks found | ~5 | 15 |
| Risks missed by thesis | N/A | 11 |
| Verdict | BUY at $272 | HOLD (already bought) - do NOT add more at current price |

**Recommendation:** The position (2 shares @ $270.60 avg) should be HELD but NOT increased. The thesis FV should be revised from $394 to ~$325. The ADD trigger ($250) in the thesis should be lowered to $220-230 to provide adequate MoS for what is realistically a Tier B business. Monitor FTC lawsuit and Q1 FY2026 ARR growth closely.

---

## 🔄 META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres
- **ARR re-acceleration vs continued deceleration:** The 70M freemium users and 3x credit consumption growth are genuinely strong leading indicators. If these convert to paid subscribers at historical rates, ARR could re-accelerate in H2 FY2026. But leading indicators have been strong for 2 years without arresting the ARR deceleration trend. I assign 35% probability to re-acceleration, 65% to continued deceleration.
- **FTC lawsuit outcome:** I cannot reliably estimate the financial impact. Settlement could be $100M (immaterial) or $1B+ with structural changes (material). The range is too wide to price precisely.
- **AI copyright legal landscape:** This is genuinely unprecedented. Courts could go either way. If the Anthropic $1.5B settlement sets a precedent, Adobe could face similar exposure. But Adobe's situation (SlimLM, not Firefly) may be distinguishable.
- **Is this a falling knife or a contrarian opportunity?** The stock is down 42% from highs with 5 analyst downgrades. Maximum pessimism often creates value (our thesis). But sometimes stocks are cheap for good reason. The ARR deceleration trend is the deciding factor.

### Riesgos que Podrian Estar Subestimados
- **Figma's competitive threat:** I rated this HIGH but it could be CRITICAL. Figma has 38% YoY revenue growth, just IPO'd, and now has capital to expand beyond UI/UX into creative tools. The thesis dismisses Figma as "different market" but Figma's trajectory suggests it WILL compete directly with Creative Cloud within 2-3 years.
- **Enterprise budget reallocation:** The CIO survey showing 16-point net decrease in front-office spending could be a structural shift, not cyclical. If enterprises permanently allocate more budget to AI infrastructure and less to marketing tools, Adobe's Digital Experience segment (24% of revenue) faces secular headwinds.

### Discrepancias con Thesis
1. **QS:** Thesis 76 vs my 68. Thesis overstates by counting ROIC spread as +17pp when tool says +11.3pp. Thesis does not account for growth deceleration trajectory or XD abandonment in moat scoring.
2. **FV:** Thesis $394 vs my $325. Thesis uses 5.5% OEY target which is too generous for a decelerating business with 5 analyst downgrades.
3. **Risk awareness:** Thesis mentions zero legal risks. A federal lawsuit against the company and its executives, which has survived a motion to dismiss, is material information that must be in any serious analysis.
4. **Insider activity:** Thesis says "sin ventas masivas" but data shows insiders sold $17M vs bought $1.5M in 12 months. CEO Narayen sold $13M at $526/share. This is not "no selling."
5. **Growth narrative:** Thesis says "Growth stable at 7-8%" but the actual trend is 12.3% -> 11.8% -> 11.7% -> 11.5% -> 10.2% guidance. This is a TREND, not stability.

### Sugerencias para el Sistema
1. **Add FTC/DOJ lawsuit to kill conditions monitoring** -- check status each earnings cycle
2. **Track ARR growth quarterly** -- if drops below 8%, escalate
3. **Revise thesis FV to $325** and adjust standing order triggers accordingly
4. **Create technology sector view** (thesis itself flagged this as missing)
5. **Quality scorer tool should consider growth trajectory** (decelerating growth should reduce Growth Quality score, not just absolute CAGR)

### Preguntas para Orchestrator
1. Should the thesis FV be revised from $394 to $325 based on this assessment?
2. Should the ADD trigger be lowered from $250 to $220-230?
3. Does the FTC lawsuit + AI copyright exposure warrant reclassifying this from Tier A to Tier B?
4. Given that 12/13 prior adversarial reviews found inflated FV (avg -15%), should we systematically apply a -15% haircut to ALL thesis fair values as a standing correction?
5. Is the 2-share position size still appropriate, or should we consider trimming to 1 share given the higher risk profile?
