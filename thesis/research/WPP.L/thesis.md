# WPP PLC (WPP.L) - Thesis v2.0
**Date**: 2026-02-03 (v2.0 Framework Update)
**Analyst**: Fundamental Analyst Agent
**Status**: DO NOT BUY - PROBABLE VALUE TRAP
**Tier**: C (Turnaround/Speculative)
**Required MoS**: >=35%
**Current MoS**: 24-28% (INSUFFICIENT)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

WPP is the world's largest advertising holding company, trading at distressed valuations (P/E 7.8x, yield 10.5%) after a 66% decline from 52-week highs. The thesis v2.0 re-evaluation concludes this is a **PROBABLE VALUE TRAP** with 5-6 of 10 value trap factors present.

**Key Numbers:**
- Price: 273 GBp (2.73 GBP)
- Fair Value (weighted): 380 GBp (3.80 GBP)
- MoS: 28% (FAILS 35% Tier C requirement)
- Standing Order: 200 GBp (44% MoS - MAINTAIN)
- Next Catalyst: Feb 19, 2026 (FY2025 + CEO Rose strategic plan)

**Verdict: DO NOT BUY at current prices. The 200 GBp standing order is CORRECT and possibly should be even lower given value trap characteristics.**

## 1. BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING (Framework v2.0)

### 1.1 Model of Business

**Problem Solved:** WPP helps large corporations create, plan, and execute advertising and brand communications. The pain point: "I have a product but don't know how to reach my audience efficiently."

**Client Segment:** Fortune 500 companies, primarily CPG, automotive, tech, and financial services.

**Must-have vs Nice-to-have:** HISTORICALLY must-have (companies must advertise to sell). BUT alternatives now exist: in-house agencies, AI tools, direct platform buying (Google, Meta).

### 1.2 Revenue Model

| Type | % Revenue | Characteristics |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| Retainer/Fees | ~60% | Annual contracts, semi-recurring |
| Project-based | ~30% | Campaign-specific, lumpy |
| Media commissions | ~10% | % of media spend |

**CRITICAL PROBLEM:** The model is "time and materials" - they bill for hours of creative/strategic work. This is EXACTLY what AI automates.

### 1.3 Unit Economics (Agency Model)

Traditional CAC/LTV doesn't apply. Relevant metrics:

| Metric | WPP | Publicis | Assessment |
|--------|-----|----------|------------|
| Revenue/Head | ~115K GBP | ~130K EUR | WORSE |
| Client Retention | 85-90% | 92%+ | WORSE and DECLINING |
| Top-20 Client Value | 100-200M/yr | Similar | - |
| Client Duration | 8-15 years | Similar | SHORTENING |

**Core Problem:** When a client leaves (Mars, Coca-Cola), you lose 100-200M/year instantly. Switching costs for clients are LOW.

### 1.4 Margin Structure

| Metric | WPP H1 2025 | WPP 2024 | Publicis 2025 | Trend |
|--------|-------------|----------|---------------|-------|
| Operating Margin | 8.2% | 11.5% | ~17% | COMPRESSING |
| Net Margin | ~3-4% | ~6-7% | ~11% | COMPRESSING |
| FCF Margin | ~4% | ~5% | ~10% | DETERIORATING |

**WPP-SPECIFIC PROBLEM:** Operating margin 8.2% vs Publicis 17% is NOT the sector - it's WPP execution failure. Publicis invested in tech/data (Epsilon acquisition) and is reaping rewards.

### 1.5 Capital Requirements

- **Business type:** Asset-light (no factories) BUT high headcount (109,000 employees)
- **Working capital:** NEGATIVE (positive for cash - client float)
- **Capex:** ~1-2% of revenue (mainly IT, offices)
- **The problem:** If revenue drops 10%, fixed salary costs don't drop 10%

## 2. WHY IS IT CHEAP? (Framework v2.0)

### 2.1 Market Narrative

The market believes:
- [X] **AI disruption** - Google Performance Max, AI-generated creative automate agency work
- [X] **Client losses** - Coca-Cola, Mars ($1.7B) to Publicis
- [X] **Management issues** - CEO departed, new CEO untested at WPP
- [X] **Margin pressure** - 8.2% vs peers 15-17%
- [X] **Balance sheet** - 1.98x Net Debt/EBITDA, Altman Z 1.06
- [X] **Sector out-of-favor** - Ad agencies seen as disrupted

### 2.2 My Counter-Thesis

| Market Believes | I Believe | My Evidence | Prob I'm Wrong |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| AI eliminates agencies | AI changes but doesn't eliminate agencies | Companies still need strategy, brand management | **50%** |
| WPP is obsolete vs Publicis | WPP can close gap with restructuring | Cindy Rose + McKinsey transformation | **60%** |
| Client losses will continue | Client losses are cyclical | Ad spending +8.8%, eventually WPP benefits | **40%** |
| Balance sheet is dangerous | Altman Z is mechanical, WPP has float | Working capital float ~3B is pseudo-cash | **30%** |

**CONCLUSION:** My counter-thesis is WEAK. In 3 of 4 factors, I have >40% probability of being wrong.

### 2.3 Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | Status | Comment |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Industry in secular decline | **MAYBE** | Ad spending grows, but traditional agency model declining |
| Imminent tech disruption | **YES** | AI automating media planning, creative |
| Management destroying value | **NO** | New CEO, too early to judge |
| Balance sheet deteriorating | **YES** | 1.98x EBITDA above target, cash outflow H1 |
| Massive insider selling | **NO** | No evidence of unusual selling |
| Recent/probable dividend cut | **YES** | Cut 50% in H1 2025 |
| Market share loss >2pp in 3 years | **YES** | Coca-Cola, Mars losses = significant share loss |
| ROIC < WACC last 3 years | **MAYBE** | ROE declining, ROIC likely <10% |
| Negative FCF >2 years | **NO** | FCF still positive, ~550M expected |
| Goodwill >50% equity | **YES** | Likely yes given acquisition history |

**VALUE TRAP SCORE: 5-6 of 10 = PROBABLE VALUE TRAP**
**RULE: >3 factors = REJECT or Tier C with 35% MoS**

### 2.4 My Informational Advantage

- [ ] Longer time horizon - NO, turnarounds are 2-3 years
- [ ] Better business understanding - MAYBE, but market understands it too
- [ ] Market overreacting - POSSIBLE, -66% could be excessive
- [X] Quantitative analysis - YES, rigorous DCF and multi-method
- [ ] Misinterpreted public info - NO, consensus is reasonable

**WARNING: Informational advantage is WEAK. Market is probably right that this is high risk.**

## 3. PROJECTIONS (Framework v2.0 - No Defaults)

### 3.1 TAM Analysis

**Global Advertising TAM:**
- 2025: ~$900B (Statista, GroupM)
- Growth: 8.8% 2025, **5% CAGR** going forward (conservative vs elevated 2025)
- Digital: 65%+ and growing
- WPP serviceable market: ~$400B (ex-China local, small business)

### 3.2 Market Share Analysis

| Player | Share (Agency Holdings) | Trend |
|--------|------------------------|-------|
| Omnicom+IPG | ~25% | GROWING (merger) |
| Publicis | ~15% | GROWING |
| **WPP** | **~13%** | **LOSING** |
| Dentsu | ~8% | Stable |
| Others/In-house | ~39% | In-house GROWING |

**WPP Trend:** Losing 0.5-1pp per year

### 3.3 Pricing Power: WEAK/NEGATIVE

- Operating margin compressing (11.5% to 8.2%)
- Client losses suggest ZERO pricing power
- AI enabling clients to pay less
- Time-and-materials model under pressure

### 3.4 Revenue Projection (Derived)

```
Industry: TAM +5% - WPP underperformance 3-4% = 0% to +1% for WPP
```

| Scenario | Revenue Growth | Logic |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Bear | -3%/year | Continued share loss, AI accelerates, more client losses |
| Base | 0%/year | Stabilizes after restructuring, no growth but no decline |
| Bull | +3%/year | Turnaround works, some share recovery, ad market strong |

### 3.5 Margin Projection

| Scenario | Operating Margin | Logic |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| Bear | 7% | Restructuring fails, more losses |
| Base | 10% | Partial restructuring success |
| Bull | 13% | Full turnaround, close gap with peers |

### 3.6 WACC Derivation (Not Default)

```
Risk-Free Rate (UK 10Y Gilt): 4.0%
Equity Risk Premium: 5.5%
Beta: 1.5 (adjusted for turnaround risk)
Ke = 4.0% + 1.5 * 5.5% = 12.25%

Cost of Debt: ~5.5%
Tax Rate: 24%
Kd after-tax = 5.5% * (1 - 0.24) = 4.2%

Market Cap: 2.9B GBP
Net Debt: 2.5B GBP (average)
EV: 5.4B GBP
E/V = 54%, D/V = 46%

WACC = (54% * 12.25%) + (46% * 4.2%) = 8.5% base

Scenarios: Bear 11%, Base 10%, Bull 9%
```

### 3.7 Terminal Growth

- WPP in turnaround: 0-2% terminal growth (conservative)
- Scenarios: Bear 1.5%, Base 2.0%, Bull 2.5%

## 4. VALUATION (Multi-Method per Framework v2.0)

### Company Type: TURNAROUND
**Methods per skill:** Sum-of-Parts/EV/EBIT (primary), DCF (secondary), P/E Comparables (tertiary)

### 4.1 Method 1: EV/EBIT Normalized

```
WPP Revenue: ~15B GBP
Normalized Operating Margin: 10% (between current 8.2% and peer 15%)
Normalized EBIT: 1.5B GBP

Sector EV/EBIT: 7-10x
WPP discount for execution risk: -2x
WPP multiple: 7x

EV = 1.5B * 7x = 10.5B GBP
Net Debt: 2.5B GBP
Equity Value: 8.0B GBP
Shares: 1.08B
Fair Value: 7.40 GBP (740 GBp)

Risk-adjusted (50% normalization probability): ~4.00 GBP
```

### 4.2 Method 2: DCF (Derived Parameters)

| Scenario | FCF Base | Growth | WACC | Terminal | FV/Share |
|----------|----------|--------|------|----------|----------|
| Bear | 450M | -3%/yr | 11% | 1.5% | 1.20 GBP |
| Base | 550M | 0%/yr | 10% | 2.0% | 3.50 GBP |
| Bull | 650M | +3%/yr | 9% | 2.5% | 7.45 GBP |

### 4.3 Method 3: P/E Comparables

| Company | P/E | Notes |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Publicis | 11.7x | Premium - better execution |
| Omnicom | 10.5x | Premium - merger synergies |
| **WPP** | **7.8x** | Discount - execution risk |

Fair multiple for WPP: 8-10x (discount to peers)
WPP TTM EPS: ~35p
**FV via P/E: 280-350 GBp (2.80-3.50 GBP)**

### 4.4 Reconciliation

| Method | Fair Value | Weight | Weighted |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| EV/EBIT risk-adj | 4.00 GBP | 30% | 1.20 |
| DCF prob-weighted | 3.91 GBP | 50% | 1.96 |
| P/E comparables | 3.15 GBP | 20% | 0.63 |
| **Weighted Average** | | 100% | **3.79 GBP** |

**Fair Value: 380 GBp (3.80 GBP)**
**Current Price: 273 GBp**
**MoS: 28%**

---

## 5. SCENARIOS

| Scenario | Probability | Fair Value | Assumption |
|----------|-------------|------------|------------|
| Bear | 30% | 120 GBp | Turnaround fails, more client losses, AI disrupts faster |
| Base | 50% | 350 GBp | Stabilization, Rose delivers partial turnaround |
| Bull | 20% | 745 GBp | Full turnaround, client wins, margin recovery to 13%+ |

**Expected Value:** (0.30 * 120) + (0.50 * 350) + (0.20 * 745) = 36 + 175 + 149 = **360 GBp**
**MoS vs Expected Value:** 24%
**MoS vs Bear Case:** NEGATIVE (would be down 56%)

---

## 6. DECISION (7 Gates)

| Gate | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1. Business understanding | PASS | Model, unit economics, margins understood |
| 2. Projection fundamentada | PASS | TAM, share, pricing logically derived |
| 3. Multi-method valuation | PASS | 3 methods, convergent results |
| 4. Margin of safety | **FAIL** | 24-28% MoS vs 35% required Tier C |
| 5. Macro context | PASS | Ad spending +8.8%, but WPP underperforming |
| 6. Portfolio fit | PASS | Would be <7% position |
| 7. Explicit self-critique | PASS | Value trap checklist 5-6/10, weak counter-thesis |

**GATE 4 FAIL = DO NOT BUY**

---

## 7. RISK ASSESSMENT

### 7.1 Key Risks (Ranked)

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Severity |
|------|------------|--------|----------|
| Further client losses | HIGH (60%) | HIGH | CRITICAL |
| AI disruption accelerates | HIGH (50%) | HIGH | CRITICAL |
| Revenue decline continues | MEDIUM-HIGH (45%) | HIGH | HIGH |
| Restructuring costs depress FCF | HIGH (70%) | MEDIUM | HIGH |
| Further dividend cut | MEDIUM (40%) | MEDIUM | MEDIUM |
| Debt covenant issues | LOW (20%) | VERY HIGH | HIGH |

### 7.2 Kill Conditions

1. Net debt/EBITDA > 2.5x
2. Two more top-10 client losses
3. FY2025 FCF < 400M GBP
4. Operating margin < 6%
5. Goodwill impairment > 500M GBP

### 7.3 Catalysts to Monitor

| Catalyst | Date | Impact |
|----------|------|--------|
| FY2025 Results + Rose Plan | Feb 19, 2026 | CRITICAL |
| H1 2026 Results | Aug 2026 | First test of turnaround |
| Major client win | Anytime | Competitive recovery signal |

---

## 8. STANDING ORDER ASSESSMENT

**Current Standing Order: 200 GBp**

Calculation for 35% MoS:
- vs Fair Value 380 GBp: Entry = 380 * 0.65 = 247 GBp
- vs Expected Value 360 GBp: Entry = 360 * 0.65 = 234 GBp
- vs Base Case 350 GBp: Entry = 350 * 0.65 = 228 GBp

**200 GBp provides 44% MoS vs Expected Value - CONSERVATIVE but APPROPRIATE given:**
- 5-6/10 value trap factors
- Weak counter-thesis
- Altman Z 1.06 (distress zone)
- Untested CEO with plan not yet revealed

**RECOMMENDATION: MAINTAIN 200 GBp standing order**

At 200 GBp, IF price reaches that level, re-evaluate:
1. Has Feb 19 passed (Rose's plan)?
2. Any more client losses?
3. FCF H2 2025 on track?

---

## 9. SELF-CRITIQUE (Framework v2.0)

### Assumptions Made

1. FCF base of 550M is estimate - could be lower given H1 outflow
2. Net debt 2.5B is between year-end 2024 and H1 2025 average
3. Peer multiples assume Publicis fairly valued (may be stretched)
4. Normalized margin 10% assumes partial restructuring success

### Biases Identified

1. **Anchoring:** 66% decline makes it "feel" cheap
2. **Mean reversion:** Tempting to assume WPP closes gap with Publicis
3. **Contrarian:** Tempting to be contrarian on hated stock

### Evidence Potentially Ignored

1. WPP Open Pro and Google deal could be genuinely transformative
2. Rose's Microsoft background could bring tech-first thinking
3. At 2.9B market cap, WPP could be acquisition target
4. >50% of pitches already integrated - Rose may formalize existing trend

### Final Assessment

**HONEST CONCLUSION:** This offers inadequate risk-adjusted return at current prices. Bear case risk (-56%) is too severe relative to base case upside (+28%). For a turnaround, we need much wider margin of safety.

**WAIT for 200 GBp OR credible evidence of operational inflection after Feb 19.**
