## 1. Executive Summary

Unite Group is the UK's largest owner, manager, and developer of purpose-built student accommodation (PBSA), providing homes to 68,000 students across 152 properties in 23 university cities. The stock trades at 567.5 GBp, a **42% discount to EPRA NTA of 986p**, making it one of the most deeply discounted quality REITs in Europe.

**Verdict: BUY candidate with 35-45% margin of safety on NAV basis, but near-term earnings headwinds (FY2026 EPS -7-10%) and occupancy risk warrant caution. The discount is compelling but may not be fully irrational given regulatory/demand risks.**

## 3. Business Description

Unite Group is a UK REIT specializing in PBSA. The business model consists of:

1. **Owned properties**: Core portfolio of ~68,000 beds, generating rental income
2. **University partnerships**: Long-term nomination agreements (universities guarantee occupancy)
3. **Development pipeline**: 10,000 beds, GBP 1.9B total cost -- organic growth engine
4. **Fund management**: USAF (Unite Students Accommodation Fund) and LSAV joint ventures
5. **Empiric acquisition**: GBP 634M deal approved, consolidating the UK listed PBSA market

Revenue split is predominantly rental income (GBP 398M in FY2024, +8% YoY). The model is operationally simple: build/buy student beds near top universities, rent them at above-inflation rates.

## 4. Moat Assessment

**Overall: NARROW MOAT (trending toward wide)**

| Moat Source | Score | Assessment |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| **Efficient Scale** | STRONG | UK's largest PBSA operator. After Empiric acquisition, near-monopoly in listed PBSA. Planning permission barriers limit new supply (~15,000 beds/yr vs structural deficit of 100,000+). Building Safety Act adds 6 months to delivery timelines. |
| **Switching Costs** | MODERATE | Students sign annual leases, but university nomination agreements create sticky institutional relationships. Unite's PRISM platform (GBP 33M investment) increases operational lock-in. |
| **Cost Advantages** | MODERATE | Scale advantages in procurement, technology (PRISM platform), and property management. Empiric synergies will improve this further. |
| **Intangibles** | MODERATE | Strong brand with universities. BBB+ credit rating enables cheaper financing than smaller competitors. 30+ year operating track record. |
| **Network Effects** | WEAK | Limited direct network effects, though university partnership network creates indirect reinforcement. |

**Key moat risk**: Government immigration policy (visa restrictions reducing international student demand). This is the single biggest moat vulnerability.

## 5. Financial Analysis

### Revenue & Earnings Trends
- FY2022: Revenue growth driven by post-COVID recovery
- FY2023: Rental income ~GBP 370M, adj EPS 44.3p
- FY2024: Rental income GBP 398M (+8%), adj EPS 46.6p (+5%)
- FY2025E: Adj EPS 47.5-48.25p (+2-3%), rental growth 4.0%
- FY2026E: Adj EPS ~43-44.5p (-7-10%), occupancy 93-96%, rental growth 2-3%
- FY2027E: Return to growth expected (management guidance)

### Margin Profile
- Operating margins stable, PBSA is high-margin (limited opex vs residential)
- Cost of debt rising: 3.6% (FY2024) -> 4.1% (FY2025E) -> higher in FY2026

### Balance Sheet
- LTV 26% (target ~30%) -- conservative for a REIT
- Net debt/EBITDA 5.3x (target 6-7x) -- well within limits
- Interest cover 6.9x -- very healthy
- GBP 824M liquidity headroom (cash + undrawn facilities)
- No debt maturities before 2029 (post-USAF refinancing)
- 75-95% of debt fixed/hedged
- BBB+/Baa1 investment grade -- strong for UK REIT sector

**Balance sheet verdict: STRONG. Conservative leverage, ample liquidity, no near-term refinancing risk.**

### FCF Note
DCF is not applicable for REITs with large development pipelines. FCF is negative due to development capex (GBP 1.9B pipeline), not operational weakness. This is value-creating capex (development yields typically 7-8% vs acquisition yields 5-6%).

## 6. Valuation

### Method 1: NAV-Based (Primary for REITs)

| Scenario | NAV/share | Discount at 567.5p | Notes |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| Current EPRA NTA | 986p | -42.5% | H1 2025 reported |
| Conservative (10% haircut) | 887p | -36.0% | Assumes portfolio devaluation |
| Stress (20% haircut) | 789p | -28.1% | Severe downturn scenario |
| Bear (30% haircut) | 690p | -17.8% | Extreme scenario |

At current price, even a 30% haircut to NAV still implies the stock is undervalued.

### Method 2: Earnings Multiple

| Scenario | EPS | Multiple | Fair Value | MoS at 567.5p |
|----------|-----|----------|------------|----------------|
| FY2025 base | 47.9p | 16x | 766p | 26% |
| FY2025 conservative | 47.9p | 14x | 671p | 15% |
| FY2026 trough | 43.5p | 16x | 696p | 18% |
| FY2026 conservative | 43.5p | 14x | 609p | 7% |

UK PBSA REITs historically traded at 16-20x adjusted earnings. Using 14-16x as conservative range.

### Method 3: Dividend Yield (Cross-check)

Current yield: 6.6% (37.3p / 567.5p). Dividend expected flat in FY2026. If yield normalizes to 4.5-5.0% (historical average for quality UK REITs):
- At 4.5% yield: fair value = 829p (MoS 32%)
- At 5.0% yield: fair value = 746p (MoS 24%)

### Valuation Summary

| Method | Fair Value Range | MoS Range |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| NAV (10-20% haircut) | 789-887p | 28-36% |
| Earnings multiple (14-16x) | 609-766p | 7-26% |
| Dividend yield (4.5-5.0%) | 746-829p | 24-32% |
| **Blended estimate** | **715-830p** | **21-32%** |

**Central fair value estimate: ~770 GBp (MoS 26% at current price)**

## 7. Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISKS
1. **International student demand** (PROBABILITY: MEDIUM, IMPACT: HIGH)
   - Immigration white paper proposes reducing post-study work visas from 24 to 18 months
   - Potential levy on international student income
   - Chinese postgraduate demand already softening
   - Mitigant: Growing UK 18-year-old population, domestic demand structural

2. **Earnings decline FY2026** (PROBABILITY: HIGH, IMPACT: MEDIUM)
   - Company guided -7-10% adj EPS for FY2026
   - Occupancy dropping to 93-96% from 95.2%
   - Higher finance costs (4.1%+ cost of debt)
   - Mitigant: Trough year, growth expected from FY2027

### MEDIUM RISKS
3. **Regulatory** (PROBABILITY: MEDIUM, IMPACT: MEDIUM)
   - Renters' Rights Bill -- unclear impact on PBSA from 2026/27
   - Building Safety Act -- delays development pipeline 6 months
   - Housing (Scotland) Bill -- PBSA likely exempt but monitoring needed

4. **Interest rates / refinancing** (PROBABILITY: LOW, IMPACT: MEDIUM)
   - No maturities before 2029 -- mitigated near-term
   - Higher-for-longer rates compress NAV multiples across all REITs
   - 75-95% hedged -- well protected

5. **Development execution** (PROBABILITY: LOW-MEDIUM, IMPACT: MEDIUM)
   - GBP 1.9B pipeline is significant vs GBP 2.8B market cap
   - Cost overruns possible (construction inflation)
   - Mitigant: Track record of on-time/budget delivery

### LOW RISKS
6. **Competition**: Sector consolidating (GCP privatized, Empiric acquired). Unite is becoming dominant.
7. **Currency**: GBP exposure only, no FX risk for underlying business.

## 8. Quality Score

| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 1. ROE >15% (5yr) | 0/1 | REITs have lower ROE by nature (~5-8%). Not applicable metric. |
| 2. FCF positive (5yr) | 0/1 | Negative due to development capex. Not applicable for development REITs. |
| 3. Debt/Equity <1.0 | 0/1 | D/E 0.28 -- PASS. But using LTV 26% which is excellent. Score as 1. |
| 4. Dividend 10+ years | 1/1 | Continuous dividend (suspended briefly in COVID, resumed). 0.5. |
| 5. Wide moat | 0.5/1 | Narrow moat trending wider. |
| 6. Revenue stability | 0.5/1 | Rental income stable but occupancy cyclicality emerging. |
| 7. Management quality | 1/1 | Prudent capital allocation, BBB+ rated, sensible leverage targets. |
| 8. Analyst coverage >10 | 1/1 | 13 analysts. |
| 9. Market cap >10B EUR | 0/1 | ~3.1B EUR. |
| 10. Defensive sector | 0.5/1 | Semi-defensive (student demand is structural, but cyclicality emerging). |

**Quality Score: 5.0/10 --> Tier B (25% MoS required)**

Note: Traditional quality score framework disadvantages REITs on ROE and FCF metrics. Adjusting for REIT-specific factors (LTV, interest cover, dividend coverage), quality would be higher (~6.5/10), but we maintain conservative scoring.

---

## 9. Portfolio Fit Assessment

**Current REIT exposure:**
- VICI Properties (US gaming REIT) -- ~8% of portfolio
- VNA.DE (Vonovia, German residential REIT) -- ~6% of portfolio

**Adding UTG.L would bring REIT allocation to ~14% of portfolio.**

| Diversification Factor | Assessment |
|------------------------|------------|
| Geographic | UK (new) vs US (VICI) and Germany (VNA). POSITIVE. |
| Sub-sector | Student PBSA vs gaming (VICI) vs residential (VNA). POSITIVE -- zero overlap. |
| Revenue drivers | Student demographics vs gaming vs German housing. UNCORRELATED. |
| Interest rate sensitivity | All REITs rate-sensitive -- NEGATIVE correlation risk. |
| Currency | GBP vs USD vs EUR -- diversified. |

**Verdict: Good diversification within REITs. Sub-sector and geographic overlap is zero. Main concern is shared interest rate sensitivity across all three REIT positions.**

---

## 10. Autocritica / Devil's Advocate

### Assumptions made:
- NAV is reliable (property valuations could decline in rising rate environment)
- FY2026 is a trough year (could get worse if immigration policy tightens further)
- Empiric acquisition will be accretive (integration risk exists)

### Biases detected:
- Anchoring to large NAV discount may blind us to fundamental deterioration
- "Cheap on NAV" is the classic value trap for REITs in declining markets

### Evidence ignored:
- The stock is at a decade low for a reason -- market may know something
- Jefferies downgraded to Hold, citing immigration visa risks
- Rental growth moderating to 2-3% barely above inflation

### What would Buffett/Klarman do?
- Buffett would like the dominant market position and irreplaceable assets
- Klarman would worry about the earnings decline trajectory and want to wait for more clarity
- Both would note the 42% NAV discount is extreme and suggests market is pricing in permanent impairment

---

## 11. Final Recommendation

**RATING: WATCHLIST -- CONDITIONAL BUY**

**Fair Value: 770 GBp (central estimate)**
**Current Price: 567.5 GBp**
**Margin of Safety: 26% (meets Tier B 25% threshold, barely)**

### Why not immediate BUY:
1. FY2026 earnings decline of 7-10% is confirmed -- we are buying into a deteriorating year
2. Occupancy at 95.2% and falling -- need to see FY2026/27 reservation data stabilize
3. Immigration policy risk is binary and unpredictable
4. MoS of 26% barely clears the 25% Tier B threshold -- prefer 30%+ for conviction

### Entry conditions for BUY:
- Price below 540 GBp (MoS >30%) on NAV basis, OR
- FY2026/27 reservations above 95% (demand stabilizing), OR
- Immigration policy clarity (positive outcome on visa restrictions)

### Price targets:
- **Buy zone**: Below 540 GBp (30%+ MoS)
- **Fair value**: 770 GBp
- **Sell target**: 870+ GBp (approaching NAV)

### Position sizing (if bought):
- Starter: 3% of portfolio (~350 EUR at current portfolio size)
- Full: 5% (pending FY2026 results confirmation)
