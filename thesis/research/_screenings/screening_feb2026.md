## 1. UK DEEP VALUE (Priority: geo rebalance to UK)

### Tier A: Strong Candidates (MoS >25% likely)

| Ticker | Company | Price | P/E | Yield | FV Est. | MoS Est. | Sector | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|-----|-------|---------|----------|--------|-------|
| TATE.L | Tate & Lyle | GBX 377 | 8.8x | 5.3% | GBX 725 (MS) | ~48% | Consumer Staples | Down 42% in 2025. Payout 58%. 25yr dividend. Narrow moat (switching costs). FILLS MISSING SECTOR. |
| DGE.L | Diageo | GBX 1656 | 13x fwd | 4.8% | GBX 2088 (analysts) | ~26% | Consumer Staples | Fwd P/E 13x vs trailing 21x. Yield 2x historical avg. Wide moat (brands). Payout ~100% is risk. |
| JD.L | JD Sports | GBX 83 | 7x fwd | 1.2% | GBX 111 (analysts) | ~35% | Consumer Disc. | "Chronically undervalued" per Peel Hunt. P/S 0.34x. Low yield but massive upside. |
| CRDA.L | Croda International | GBX 2715 | 18x norm | 4.2% | GBX 3610 (SWS DCF) | ~25% | Materials/Chemicals | 5-star Morningstar. Narrow moat. Transitioning to high-value niches. FILLS MISSING SECTOR. |
| BARC.L | Barclays | GBX 478 | 8.6x fwd | 1.7% | GBX 749 (MS) | ~36% | Banks | P/B 0.83x. MS top pick. Low yield but buybacks. FILLS MISSING SECTOR. |

### Tier B: Worth Monitoring

| Ticker | Company | Price | P/E | Yield | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|-----|-------|-------|
| EMG.L | Man Group | GBX 257 | 12x | 5.0% | Record AUM $193B. But Morningstar says fairly valued at 227p. ALREADY ABOVE FV. PASS. |
| UKW.L | Greencoat UK Wind | ~GBX varies | N/A | 10.5% | 30% discount to NAV. Renewables. But investment trust, not operating company. |
| BTRW.L | Barratt Redrow | GBX 382 | varies | varies | Trading at 53% of DCF FV (722p). But cyclical, rate-sensitive. |
| PSN.L | Persimmon | varies | varies | varies | Housebuilder, undervalued per Morningstar. Rate-cut beneficiary. |
| MRO.L | Melrose Industries | varies | varies | varies | 30% below FV per Morningstar. Aerospace components. |

### UK Banks Comparison (all already rallied hard in 2025)

| Bank | Fwd P/E | Yield | P/B | PEG | Verdict |
|------|---------|-------|-----|-----|---------|
| BARC.L | 8.6x | 1.7% | 0.83 | -- | Best value (P/E + P/B), MS top pick |
| NWG.L | 8.9x | 5.5% | 1.31 | -- | Best income |
| LLOY.L | 9.8x | 4.4% | 1.20 | 0.4 | Best PEG (growth-adjusted) |

**Critical note on UK banks**: All rallied 40-70% in 2025. The easy money is made. Barclays at P/B 0.83 still has upside to book, but the MoS is vs Morningstar FV of 749p which implies significant growth. Proceed with caution.

## 2. US VALUE (P/E <10, yield >3%)

| Ticker | Company | Price | P/E | Yield | FV Est. | MoS Est. | Sector | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|-----|-------|---------|----------|--------|-------|
| DOC | Healthpeak Properties | $17.14 | N/M (REIT) | 7.1% | $37 (MS) | ~54% | Healthcare REIT | 5-star MS. But negative EPS, declining divs (-3.8% 5yr CAGR). REIT mechanics differ. Already have VICI (REIT). |
| LYB | LyondellBasell | $49.95 | neg | 10.8% | ~$49 (analysts) | ~0% | Chemicals | YIELD TRAP. Payout 127%. Goldman Sell. Buybacks paused. Div at risk. AVOID. |
| KHC | Kraft Heinz | $23.74 | neg | high | $44 (Alpha Spread) | ~42% | Consumer Staples | Negative earnings. Berkshire EXITING (325M shares). Splitting company. HIGH RISK. |

**US is tough right now**: Most S&P500 value screens surface yield traps (LYB, KHC) or negative-EPS situations. The stocks already on our watchlist (CVS, GIS, CMCSA, ADM.L, AMT) are better candidates than what this search surfaced. Recommend focusing on existing US watchlist rather than adding new names.

## TOP RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DEEP ANALYSIS

### Priority 1: TATE.L (Tate & Lyle) -- STRONG BUY CANDIDATE
- **Why**: P/E 8.8x, yield 5.3%, MoS ~48% vs Morningstar FV of 725p. UK-listed (helps geo balance). Consumer staples (fills missing sector). 25-year dividend history with 58% payout ratio (sustainable). Down 42% in 2025 creating deep value entry.
- **Risks**: Small cap (1.66B). Revenue growth uncertain. Need to verify why it fell 42%.
- **Action**: Full fundamental analysis recommended.

### Priority 2: DGE.L (Diageo) -- WATCHLIST / CONDITIONAL BUY
- **Why**: Wide moat, global brand portfolio (Johnnie Walker, Guinness, Smirnoff). Fwd P/E 13x. Yield 4.8% (2x historical). UK-listed. Consumer staples.
- **Risks**: Payout ~100%. Alcohol consumption declining in some markets. Need earnings Feb 25 before buying.
- **Action**: Add to watchlist. Analyze after Feb 25 earnings.

### Priority 3: BARC.L (Barclays) -- CONDITIONAL BUY
- **Why**: P/B 0.83x (below book). Fwd P/E 8.6x. Morgan Stanley top pick. UK banks delivering NII growth. FILLS missing bank sector.
- **Risks**: Already rallied 70%+ in 2025. Rate cut risk. Low yield (1.7%). Cyclical.
- **Action**: Full fundamental analysis recommended. May be better to wait for pullback.

### Priority 4: CRDA.L (Croda International) -- MONITOR
- **Why**: 5-star Morningstar, narrow moat, chemicals/materials (fills gap). 4.2% yield.
- **Risks**: TTM P/E 27x (expensive on trailing). Need to verify Morningstar FV methodology.
- **Action**: Monitor. Better entry possible if it drops further.
