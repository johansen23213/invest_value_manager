# Risk Assessment: RACE.MI (Ferrari N.V.)

## Fecha: 2026-02-11

## Risk Score: MEDIUM

---

## Executive Summary

Ferrari is a genuinely exceptional business -- ROIC 24.9%, ROIC-WACC spread +14.9pp, 50% gross margins, net cash position, order book to end-2027. The stock is -35% from its 52-week high of EUR 492.80 (current EUR 322.80), creating a potential entry point. However, the risks are concentrated in three areas: (1) valuation compression if the ~5% annualized growth trajectory disappoints vs the 36x P/E multiple, (2) execution risk during the most capital-intensive period in Ferrari's history (5 new models in 2026, including the first EV "Luce"), and (3) US tariff exposure given the US is 29% of revenue. No single risk is a kill condition today, but the combination of growth deceleration + capex ramp + tariff headwind creates a period of elevated uncertainty through 2027.

## Top 3 Riesgos Criticos

### 1. Valuation Compression (P/E de-rating)

- **Categoria:** Valoracion
- **Descripcion:** Ferrari trades at 36x trailing P/E and ~33x forward P/E. The October 2025 Capital Markets Day revealed that revenue CAGR to 2030 will be ~5% (EUR 7.1B to ~EUR 9B), not the 10%+ investors expected. EBITDA CAGR ~6%, also below the 2022 CMD's implied trajectory. At these growth rates, a 36x multiple is vulnerable. If the market re-rates Ferrari to 25-30x (still a premium vs luxury peers), the stock could fall an additional 15-25% from current levels.
- **Evidencia:**
  - CMD Oct 2025: Stock fell 15% in one day, worst since IPO. EUR 13B market cap wiped.
  - Morgan Stanley downgraded to Equal Weight, cut PT from $520 to $425.
  - Jefferies PT cut to EUR 310, cautious on margin pressures from new launches.
  - Consensus analyst PT dropped 10.5% from $550 to $492 post-CMD.
  - At 25x forward EPS (~EUR 9.45 guided), fair value would be ~EUR 236. At 30x, ~EUR 284. At current 33x forward, price is EUR 312 equivalent.
- **Probabilidad:** Media (40%) -- Ferrari's brand premium is real, but the 5% growth trajectory makes it harder to justify 35x+. Requires flawless execution on new models.
- **Impacto si materializa:** 15-25% additional downside. From EUR 323, a de-rating to 28x forward P/E implies ~EUR 265, or ~18% downside.
- **Mitigante:** Ferrari has historically commanded a luxury multiple (40-60x at peaks). Order book to end-2027 provides revenue visibility. Share buyback program (EUR 3.5B through 2030) supports EPS growth beyond revenue growth.
- **Kill condition?:** YES -- if P/E sustainably compresses below 25x with no recovery catalyst, this becomes a value trap at these absolute price levels.

### 2. Luce EV Execution and Brand Identity Risk

- **Categoria:** Fundamental
- **Descripcion:** The Luce (debut May 25, 2026) is Ferrari's first fully electric vehicle. Priced above EUR 500,000, it represents a fundamental test of whether Ferrari's brand translates to EVs. Risks: (a) customer rejection -- Ferrari's core clientele buys for engine sound, driving feel, heritage; an EV strips these away, (b) technology risk -- in-house battery and motor development with no prior EV experience, (c) margin risk -- EV launches are typically margin-dilutive due to R&D amortization and new production facility costs (E-building), (d) competitive risk -- at EUR 500K+, it competes with Rimac Nevera, Pininfarina Battista, and potentially Porsche/Taycan Turbo GT at much lower prices.
- **Evidencia:**
  - Ferrari cut EV sales target from 40% to 20% of production by 2030, acknowledging client resistance.
  - CEO explicitly stated Ferrari "won't force EVs on buyers" -- implying demand uncertainty.
  - Ralf Schumacher warned Ferrari's 2026 approach "could be a disaster" (F1 + EV context).
  - E-building adds ~6,000 unit capacity but capex is elevated.
  - No prior EV track record. In-house battery/motor = higher execution risk vs outsourcing.
- **Probabilidad:** Media (30-35%) -- Ferrari has managed transitions before (SUV Purosangue was a success). Jony Ive involvement generates buzz. But the EV transition is existentially different from adding an SUV.
- **Impacto si materializa:** If Luce fails commercially or damages the brand, the luxury multiple contracts. Estimate 20-30% downside on brand narrative impairment. More critically, it would call into question the entire 2030 product plan (20% EV target, 4 models/year).
- **Mitigante:** Ferrari is not betting the farm -- EV is only 20% of 2030 production. ICE and hybrid remain 80%. Early customer feedback reportedly positive. The Luce is not required for allocation of other models. This limits the blast radius of failure.
- **Kill condition?:** YES, but conditional -- if Luce launch results in order cancellations for the broader Ferrari lineup (contagion effect on brand), that would be a kill condition. Isolated Luce underperformance is manageable.

### 3. US Tariff Exposure (25% on EU Auto Imports)

- **Categoria:** Geopolitico
- **Descripcion:** The US is Ferrari's largest single market at 29% of revenue (~3,937 units in 2025). Trump's 25% tariff on non-US manufactured vehicles directly hits Ferrari since 100% of production is in Maranello, Italy. Ferrari has already passed through ~10% price increases on select US models (Purosangue, 12Cilindri, F80), adding $25K-$350K per vehicle. However: (a) the tariff is 25%, not 10% -- there is still a margin gap, (b) even UHNW buyers have limits, especially on wait-listed vehicles where the "thrill" of purchase may diminish at higher prices, (c) if tariffs escalate further under EU-US trade tensions (deadline Jun 1), the impact compounds.
- **Evidencia:**
  - Ferrari raised prices on affected US models in March 2025.
  - Management acknowledged 50bps margin impact in 2025.
  - US deliveries declined by 66 units in FY2025 (modest, but tariffs were only partial-year).
  - EU-US tariff situation is fluid: 10% reciprocal tariffs suspended but deadline Jun 1 looms.
  - EUR 93B EU retaliatory "bazooka" not yet deployed -- if used, could trigger escalation.
- **Probabilidad:** Alta (60%) -- tariffs are already in effect (25% auto). The question is whether they stay, escalate, or a deal reduces them. Given current political dynamics, staying at 25% is the base case.
- **Impacto si materializa (fully):** At 25% tariff, Ferrari absorbs ~50bps margin impact passing through 10% price hike. If tariffs stay at 25% and Ferrari cannot pass through more, gross margin impact is ~200-300bps on the US portion (~29% of revenue), translating to ~60-90bps on consolidated EBIT margin. Not existential, but at 36x P/E, every basis point matters. If tariffs escalate to 35%+ or EU retaliates causing further disruption, the impact compounds.
- **Mitigante:** Ferrari's pricing power is extreme -- the Purosangue had a EUR 390K MSRP and 2+ year wait list. UHNW buyers are less price-sensitive. Ferrari has already proven ability to pass through some tariff cost. Tariff deals are possible (India precedent: reduced from 50% to 18%).
- **Kill condition?:** NO at current levels. Would become kill condition if tariffs reach 50%+ AND Ferrari cannot pass through AND US unit sales decline >20%.

## Additional Risk Details

### 4. Growth Deceleration (Structural)

Ferrari's revenue CAGR was 16.1% over 2021-2024, driven by post-COVID pent-up demand, pricing power, and new model launches (Roma, Purosangue, 296). The CMD 2025 guided ~5% revenue CAGR to 2030 (EUR 7.1B to EUR ~9B). This is not a failure -- it is a deliberate choice to cap production at ~14,000 units/year (currently 13,640). But investors who bought at 50-60x P/E expected double-digit compounding. The re-pricing from EUR 492 to EUR 323 (-35%) reflects this expectation adjustment. The risk is that 5% growth is the NEW ceiling, not a temporary phase.

- **Probabilidad:** Alta (55%) -- management guided this explicitly. This is not a risk; it is the plan.
- **Impacto:** Medio -- already partially priced in (stock down 35%). But full re-rating may not be complete.

### 5. China Revenue Decline

China + HK + Taiwan declined from ~10% to ~8% of revenue. Deliveries fell 221 units in FY2025 (from ~1,162 to ~941). Causes: luxury spending contraction, 25% Chinese retaliatory tariffs on large-engine vehicles, preference shift toward domestic EVs. Ferrari claims the decline is "self-imposed cap" to maintain exclusivity, but the market skepticism is warranted.

- **Probabilidad:** Alta (70%) -- continued China weakness is highly likely given structural shifts.
- **Impacto:** Bajo -- China is only 8% of revenue. Even a 50% further decline = ~4% revenue headwind. Ferrari has demonstrated ability to redirect allocation to stronger regions.

### 6. EU Emissions Regulation

The EU 2035 ICE ban has been softened to a 90% emissions reduction target. Low-volume manufacturers (1,000-10,000 units in EU) get partial exemptions. Ferrari sells ~4,000-5,000 units in EU, within the exemption threshold. The hybrid/EV roadmap (60% hybrid+EV by 2026) provides compliance pathway.

- **Probabilidad:** Baja (15%) -- regulation has moved in Ferrari's favor.
- **Impacto:** Medio -- if exemption were removed, compliance costs would be material.

### 7. Capital Intensity Increase

Ferrari is spending heavily on: (a) E-building for EV/hybrid production, (b) new paint shop, (c) in-house battery development, (d) 5 new models in 2026 alone (Luce + 4 others). Industrial capex increased meaningfully in 2025 vs prior years.

- Despite this, industrial FCF grew 50% to EUR 1,538M in FY2025. Net industrial debt is only EUR 32M.
- The balance sheet can handle this investment cycle. Total debt EUR 3.0B vs equity EUR 3.5B (D/E 84%).
- Interest coverage 48.2x -- no financial distress risk.

### 8. FX Risk

EUR/USD is currently ~1.19 (EUR strong, USD weak). Ferrari reports in EUR but earns 29% of revenue in USD. A 10% EUR appreciation reduces USD-denominated revenue by ~3% at the consolidated level. Ferrari hedges FX but hedging only delays, it does not eliminate the impact.

## Riesgos NO Mencionados en Thesis

(No thesis exists yet for RACE.MI, so this section documents risks that a bull case typically ignores.)

| Riesgo | Severidad | Typically Ignored? | Comentario |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| CMD 2025 growth guidance reset (5% CAGR) | HIGH | Often minimized as "conservative guidance" | Management explicitly guided this. Investors hoping for beats may be disappointed if this IS the trajectory |
| Tariff margin absorption on US revenue | HIGH | Dismissed as "pricing power will handle it" | 10% price hike covers part of 25% tariff. The remaining ~15% is either margin loss or further price increases that risk volume |
| Luce brand contagion risk | MEDIUM | Ignored -- assumed EV is additive | If Luce damages Ferrari's reputation for driving purity, it could affect the entire lineup's desirability |
| Model year transition risk (5 new models in 2026) | MEDIUM | Not discussed | Launching 5 models in one year (incl. first EV) is unprecedented operational complexity for Ferrari |
| Order book exhaustion post-2027 | MEDIUM | Assumed perpetual demand | The order book is "to end 2027" -- what happens after? If macro weakens, refilling becomes harder |
| EUR 3.5B buyback may be a valuation crutch | LOW | Praised uncritically | Buybacks at 36x P/E are not value-creating. At 20x they would be. This is financial engineering, not value creation |
| Dividend yield data anomaly | LOW | N/A | quality_scorer.py shows 96% dividend yield -- clearly a yfinance data error. Actual yield is ~0.7% (~EUR 2.44/share). This does not affect the investment case but any automated screening based on this data would be misleading |

---

## Kill Conditions Sugeridas

If a thesis is written for RACE.MI, the following kill conditions should be included:

1. **P/E de-rating below 25x trailing with no recovery within 6 months.** This would signal the market has permanently re-classified Ferrari from "luxury compounder" to "auto manufacturer" -- a structural multiple change.

2. **Luce launch results in net order book decline across the Ferrari range.** If the EV damages the brand such that existing ICE/hybrid models see order cancellations, the brand premium is impaired.

3. **US tariffs exceed 35% AND Ferrari US volumes decline >15% YoY.** This would indicate pricing power has reached its limit in the largest market.

4. **EBIT margin declines below 25% for two consecutive quarters.** FY2025 EBIT margin was 29.5%. A decline to 25% would signal that the capex ramp / model transition is eroding the core profitability that justifies the premium.

5. **CEO Vigna departure without credible successor.** Given the transformation program underway, loss of the architect mid-execution would create significant uncertainty.

## Riesgo Agregado

- Numero de riesgos HIGH+CRITICAL: 4 (P/E compression, Luce execution, US tariffs, growth deceleration)
- Riesgos correlacionados? **SI** -- Growth deceleration + P/E compression are directly linked. Tariffs + FX are correlated (both macro-driven). Luce execution + growth trajectory are linked (Luce success is needed to sustain even 5% growth).
- **Correlation amplification:** If growth disappoints AND Luce underperforms AND tariffs stay high, these three risks compound. The "perfect storm" scenario could mean:
  - Revenue flat to down (vs +5% guided)
  - Margins compress 200-300bps (capex + tariffs + launch costs)
  - P/E de-rates from 36x to 25x
  - Implied price: EUR 170-200, or ~40-50% downside from current

- **Risk Score Final: MEDIUM**

**Rationale for MEDIUM (not HIGH):** Despite 4 HIGH-scored risks, the business fundamentals are genuinely strong: net cash, 50% gross margins, EUR 1.5B FCF, order book to 2027, 30% insider ownership (Exor/Agnelli alignment). The stock has already corrected 35% from highs, pricing in much of the CMD disappointment. The risks are real but manageable for a business of this quality. The MEDIUM score reflects that risks are elevated vs historical Ferrari, but the probability of the "perfect storm" scenario is low (estimated 10-15%).

## 🔄 META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres
- **Tariff trajectory is genuinely unknowable.** The Jun 1 EU deadline and political dynamics make this a coin flip. I have scored this as Alta probability at current 25% levels, but escalation to 35%+ or a deal reducing to 10-15% are both plausible.
- **Luce demand signals are opaque.** Ferrari says "early feedback is very positive" but has not disclosed pre-orders or order book data for the Luce specifically. Without hard numbers, I am relying on management statements (which carry optimistic bias per critical-thinking skill).
- **yfinance data quality issue.** The dividend yield of 96.0% from quality_scorer.py is clearly erroneous (actual ~0.7%). The RACE.MI ticker on yfinance appears to have data quality issues. This affects automated screening but not the fundamental analysis.
- **Order book "to end 2027" -- granularity missing.** Is it evenly distributed or front-loaded? If most orders are for 2026 models and 2027 is thin, the visibility is less than it appears.

### Riesgos que Podrian Estar Subestimados
- **Model year transition complexity (5 models in 2026).** I scored this as "not discussed" in the risk matrix rather than giving it its own HIGH rating. But launching 5 models including a first-ever EV in one year is unprecedented for Ferrari. Production delays, quality issues, or recall risks are non-trivial.
- **Post-2027 order book refill.** If macro weakens (US recession probability 20-30% per world view), UHNW spending could contract. Ferrari's order book provides 18 months of visibility but no visibility beyond that.

### Discrepancias con Thesis
- No thesis exists yet. This risk assessment is intended to PRECEDE and inform the thesis. The key message for the fundamental-analyst: the bear case is not about business quality (which is exceptional) but about whether 36x P/E is justified for a 5% grower in a period of elevated execution risk and macro uncertainty.

### Sugerencias para el Sistema
- **Fix yfinance data quality for RACE.MI.** The 96% dividend yield is a bug. The quality_scorer should flag extreme outliers (yield >20%) as likely data errors rather than passing them through.
- **Tariff scenario modeling tool.** Given multiple positions with tariff exposure (potential RACE.MI, NVO, etc.), a tool that models tariff impact on revenue/margins by geography would be valuable for risk assessment.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator
1. What is the portfolio's current exposure to consumer discretionary / luxury? Adding RACE.MI would increase cyclical exposure -- how does this fit with Principio 3 (sector diversification)?
2. At 36x trailing P/E, what MoS methodology should be used? A DCF will be extremely sensitive to terminal growth and WACC assumptions. Multiple-based valuation may be more appropriate for a luxury franchise. Should the fundamental-analyst prioritize one method?
3. Given that 4 of 13 positions are already UK-based and we have identified UK consumer weakness as a risk, does adding a European luxury name (Italian, EUR-denominated) provide genuine diversification or just add to the "European economy" bucket?
