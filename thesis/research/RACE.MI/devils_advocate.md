# Counter-Analysis: RACE.MI (Ferrari N.V.)

## Fecha: 2026-02-11

## CRITICAL FLAG FOR ORCHESTRATOR

**The thesis's own OEY method shows OEY + Growth (8.66%) is BELOW WACC (9.35%).** This means the primary Tier A valuation method says Ferrari is NOT creating value at current price. The entire bull case rests on a 32-33x EV/EBIT multiple being "justified" -- a subjective judgment, not a quantitative finding. The MoS of 17% is the weakest of any Tier A candidate analyzed in this portfolio's history. Every prior Tier A entry was at 29%+ MoS.

---

## Resumen Ejecutivo

The thesis identifies a genuinely exceptional business but systematically underestimates the degree to which the market has ALREADY priced in that quality. The fundamental-analyst, moat-assessor, and valuation-specialist produced outputs that are internally consistent but collectively tell a story the thesis does not acknowledge: Ferrari at EUR 323 is approximately fairly valued, not undervalued. The 17% MoS exists only because the valuation gives 50% weight to a subjective multiple-based method while the quantitative OEY method (the mandated Tier A primary method) shows no margin of safety at all. Four HIGH-severity challenges and one CRITICAL challenge were identified. The thesis survives as a description of business quality, but fails as a buy recommendation at current prices.

## Asunciones Clave Desafiadas

### 1. "Ferrari is a luxury goods company, not an automaker -- therefore luxury multiples are justified"

- **The claim:** Ferrari should be valued like Hermes (40-50x) rather than Porsche (12-15x). The thesis uses 32-33x EV/EBIT as a "conservative" luxury multiple.
- **Evidence in contra:**
  - Ferrari spends 10-11% of revenue on capex (EUR 700-800M/year) and ~15% on R&D. Hermes spends ~3% on capex. This is a STRUCTURAL difference, not a minor one. Capital intensity is an auto problem, not a luxury problem.
  - Ferrari is undergoing a EUR 4.29B investment program for EV capability (e-building, in-house batteries, motors). No luxury goods company has ever needed to spend this to remain relevant. Hermes does not need to reinvent leather.
  - Ferrari has model transition cycles (Daytona phase-out, F80 ramp, 5 new models in 2026, Luce launch). These create volume/margin volatility that pure luxury goods companies do not face.
  - The yfinance FCF figure of EUR 938M (FY2024) vs the thesis's preferred "industrial FCF" of EUR 1,538M (FY2025) itself reveals the problem: Ferrari's cash flow includes financial services activities, working capital volatility, and capex timing that luxury goods companies do not have.
  - Ferrari's gross margin is ~50% vs Hermes's ~70%. The 20pp gap is not temporary -- it reflects manufacturing complexity. The thesis acknowledges this but dismisses it as "structural, not a moat weakness."
  - Ferrari faces regulatory compliance costs (EU emissions), tariff exposure (25% US), and currency risk from global manufacturing. None of these apply to Hermes.
  - **CFRA downgraded Ferrari to Sell.** Citi said CMD guidance "falls below our lower growth case estimates." These are not fringe views.
- **Adversarial question:** If Ferrari truly deserves luxury multiples, why has its 10-year average P/E been ~39x (not 50x like Hermes)? The market has NEVER consistently valued Ferrari at Hermes-level multiples. The thesis implicitly argues the market has been wrong for a decade.
- **Severidad:** HIGH
- **Resolucion sugerida:** The investment-committee should use auto-luxury multiples (25-30x), not pure luxury multiples (35-45x). This shifts the FV range down materially.

### 2. "MoS of 17% is adequate for Tier A"

- **The claim:** A 17% MoS is "adequate but not exceptional" and "within the range where purchase is reasonable" for a Tier A compounder.
- **Evidence in contra:**
  - Every prior Tier A entry in this portfolio: NVO 38%, MONY.L 36%, LULU 34%, BYIT.L 35%, ADBE 31%, AUTO.L 29%. Average: 33.8%. Minimum: 29%.
  - The valuation-specialist's own report states: "Buying Ferrari at 17% MoS would break this precedent without strong justification."
  - The thesis's OWN primary method (OEY) shows OEY + Growth = 8.66% vs WACC 9.35% -- a NEGATIVE spread. This means at current price, Ferrari does not compensate for its cost of capital on an earnings-yield basis.
  - The thesis acknowledges this weakness but rationalizes it by saying "the QUALITY of this growth justifies a lower required return." This is circular reasoning: the quality IS the QS score, and the QS score is already reflected in the Tier A classification. Granting an additional quality discount on top of the Tier A designation is double-counting.
  - Morningstar's fair value estimate is EUR 370 -- only 15% above current price. Alpha Spread DCF estimates fair value at EUR 149-215, suggesting 47-54% overvaluation.
  - The "adequate" MoS depends entirely on the 32-33x multiple being correct. At 28x (low end of the thesis's own range), FV = EUR 350, MoS = 8%. At 25x (bear), FV = EUR 297-312, MoS = NEGATIVE.
- **Adversarial question:** Given that 6 prior Tier A entries averaged 34% MoS, what makes Ferrari so special that we should accept half that? If the answer is "quality," that quality is already captured in the 82/84 QS.
- **Severidad:** CRITICAL
- **Resolucion sugerida:** Do NOT approve purchase at EUR 323. Set entry at EUR 280-295 (MoS 28-35%), consistent with all prior Tier A precedents. The thesis itself recommends entry at EUR 290-305 -- the orchestrator should enforce this.

### 3. "FV EUR 377-379 based on 32-33x EV/EBIT"

- **The claim:** Ferrari deserves 32-33x forward EV/EBIT, producing a FV of EUR 377-400.
- **Evidence in contra:**
  - **The valuation is 85% multiple-dependent.** The valuation-specialist acknowledges: "FV changes by EUR 12.50/share for every 1x change in EV/EBIT multiple." With a reasonable range of 25-40x, FV spans EUR 312-500 -- a 60% spread. The point estimate of EUR 377 creates false precision.
  - **Growth has decelerated from 12% to 5%.** The thesis uses 6.5% revenue CAGR as "base case" (above management's 5% guidance), arguing management will beat. But management JUST reset growth expectations at CMD. Using above-guidance growth is optimistic, not conservative.
  - **2026 guidance confirms low growth:** Revenue EUR 7.5B (+5%), EBITDA margin 39% (flat from 38.8%). This is SUB-5% revenue growth with NO margin expansion. The thesis's 6.5% growth assumption is above guidance.
  - **The Seeking Alpha "Back to Square One" analysis notes:** "At 32x 2026 earnings, RACE's valuation is prohibitive given muted growth." Revenue was up only 4% in Q4, core car sales were nearly flat.
  - **PEG ratio of 4.1x** (P/E 33x / EPS growth 8%) is extremely high. The thesis compares this to Hermes (4.4x) and LVMH (3.7x), but Hermes has 10% growth and 70% GM, while Ferrari has 5-7% growth and 50% GM. The PEG comparison actually favors LVMH's framework, not Hermes's.
  - **Multiple DCF analyses from third parties** (Alpha Spread, GuruFocus, Simply Wall St, valueinvesting.io) all produce intrinsic values in the EUR 150-215 range using standard DCF. The thesis dismisses these by saying "DCF does not apply to luxury compounders." This is a dangerous argument -- it says the only valid method is multiples, which are inherently subjective.
- **Adversarial question:** If the ONLY method that justifies the current price is multiples, and the appropriate multiple is itself the key uncertainty, how is this different from saying "Ferrari is worth whatever the market says"?
- **Severidad:** HIGH
- **Resolucion sugerida:** Weight the OEY result MORE heavily (it IS the mandated Tier A primary method). At 50% OEY weight (EUR 330) + 30% EV/EBIT (EUR 400) + 20% P/E (EUR 370), FV = EUR 356. This gives MoS of 10% -- INADEQUATE for any tier.

### 4. "The bear case is EUR 280, only 13% downside"

- **The claim:** Even in the bear scenario, Ferrari is worth EUR 280, limiting downside to ~13%.
- **Evidence in contra:**
  - **The bear case uses 25x EV/EBIT.** But Ferrari's post-CMD trough P/E was ~30x (at ~EUR 275). If growth genuinely disappoints (3.5% vs 5% guided) AND tariffs bite AND Luce disappoints, a 20-22x multiple is plausible. This is still above auto sector (12-15x) but reflects "premium auto, not luxury."
  - **Deep bear math:** At 22x forward EBIT (EUR 2,100M) = EV EUR 46.2B / 177M shares = EUR 261. At 20x = EUR 237. These are not implausible -- they represent the market concluding Ferrari is a great company but not a luxury franchise.
  - **The risk assessment identifies 4 HIGH risks (P/E compression, Luce, tariffs, growth deceleration) and notes they are CORRELATED.** The "perfect storm" scenario (all 4 hit) implies EUR 170-200, or 40-50% downside. The risk-identifier ITSELF calculated this. The thesis ignores it.
  - **Porsche China sales collapsed 26% in 2025.** The thesis says China is only 8% of Ferrari revenue, but the broader signal is that ultra-luxury demand in the world's second-largest economy is weakening structurally, not cyclically. Porsche CEO admitted "we got it wrong in China."
  - **The EUR 280 bear case assumes EBIT margin only compresses to 28%.** But with 5 new model launches, Luce investment, 25% US tariff absorption, and potentially weakening demand, EBIT margin could compress to 25-26%, which combined with 25x multiple = EUR 240-270.
- **Adversarial question:** If the correlated risk scenario (the risk assessment's own "perfect storm") implies EUR 170-200, why does the thesis not include this as a deep bear case?
- **Severidad:** HIGH
- **Resolucion sugerida:** Add a "deep bear" scenario at EUR 220-250 (20-22x EBIT, 26% margin) with 10% probability. This shifts the expected value down and reveals the true downside risk.

### 5. "Risk is MEDIUM" (4 HIGH risks scored as MEDIUM aggregate)

- **The claim:** The risk assessment scores overall risk as MEDIUM despite identifying 4 HIGH risks.
- **Evidence in contra:**
  - 4 of 12 risks are HIGH: P/E compression, Luce execution, US tariffs, growth deceleration.
  - These 4 risks are CORRELATED (the risk assessment itself acknowledges this): "Growth deceleration + P/E compression are directly linked. Tariffs + FX are correlated. Luce execution + growth trajectory are linked."
  - The correlation amplification is the key issue. Any ONE of these risks is manageable. But if two or three hit simultaneously (e.g., Luce disappoints + tariffs stick at 25% + growth comes in at 3.5%), the impact compounds.
  - **Historical precedent:** The CMD alone caused -16% in one day. This was a SINGLE risk event (growth reset). A multi-factor negative scenario has not been tested.
  - The MEDIUM rating was justified by "the probability of the perfect storm scenario is low (10-15%)." But 10-15% probability of 40-50% loss is a significant tail risk for a position with only 17% MoS.
  - **Expected loss from tail:** 12.5% probability x 45% loss = 5.6% expected portfolio loss from tail risk alone (assuming 3-4% position size). This exceeds the 17% MoS.
- **Adversarial question:** How can risk be MEDIUM when the tail-risk expected loss exceeds the margin of safety?
- **Severidad:** HIGH
- **Resolucion sugerida:** Risk should be scored HIGH, not MEDIUM. The 4 correlated HIGH risks with meaningful tail risk warrant a higher overall rating. This does not disqualify Ferrari but requires a higher MoS to compensate.

## Conflictos con Otros Analisis

### Thesis vs Valuation Report

Both converge on EUR 377-379. **This is not reassuring -- it is suspicious.** The fundamental-analyst and valuation-specialist used the same methods, same data, same framework. Independent confirmation requires DIFFERENT approaches. When two agents using the same tools produce the same number, it does not increase confidence -- it confirms they both used the same assumptions.

**Key conflict:** The valuation-specialist noted "At current price, OEY + Growth is BELOW WACC" and "OEY unreliable as point estimator for Ferrari" -- yet still produced EUR 377 by giving OEY only 20% weight. This is methodological cherry-picking: the mandated Tier A primary method (OEY) says the stock is fairly valued; the secondary methods (multiples) say 17% upside; the report uses 80% weight on the secondary methods.

### Thesis vs Risk Assessment

The risk assessment identified a "perfect storm" scenario at EUR 170-200 (40-50% downside). The thesis does not incorporate this at all. The bear case is EUR 280 (-13%). The gap between the risk assessment's downside and the thesis's bear case is EUR 80-110. This is a material discrepancy.

### Moat Assessment: Near-Perfect Score Warranted?

The moat assessment gave 23/25 WIDE EXPANDING. While Ferrari's moat is genuinely strong, a 23/25 score leaves almost no room for error. Questions:
- **Is the "expanding" trajectory correct?** ROIC expanded from 20.3% to 24.9% (2021-2024), but 2026 guidance implies flat margins and elevated capex. The expansion may pause during the EV transition.
- **Are the ASP growth figures sustainable?** ASP grew from EUR 385K to EUR 521K (2021-2025), +35% in 4 years. This was driven by Daytona SP3 (EUR 2M+), F80 (EUR 3.6M+), and personalization. As these one-time boosts normalize, ASP growth should slow.
- **The moat assessment scored "Network Effects" at 2/5 and "Efficient Scale" at 3/5.** These are generous. Ferrari does not have network effects in any conventional sense. "Social signaling" is a brand attribute, not a network effect. And efficient scale of 3/5 for a 13,600-unit producer seems high.

## Veredicto Global

| Metric | Valor |
|--------|-------|
| Total Desafios | 18 |
| Desafios HIGH/CRITICAL | 9 of 18 (50%) |
| Desafios CRITICAL | 2 (OEY < WACC; MoS breaks precedent) |
| Desafios no resueltos por thesis | 7 |
| Veredicto | **STRONG COUNTER** |

### Interpretacion:

**STRONG COUNTER.** The thesis correctly identifies Ferrari as an exceptional business (QS 82-84, wide moat, strong execution). The business quality is NOT in dispute. What IS in dispute is whether EUR 323 is a good price to BUY this business. The evidence strongly suggests it is not:

1. The mandated Tier A primary valuation method (OEY) shows the stock does not clear its cost of capital at current price.
2. The 17% MoS is the lowest of any Tier A candidate in portfolio history, breaking a 29-38% precedent.
3. The FV is almost entirely dependent on a subjective multiple assumption.
4. The risk profile includes 4 correlated HIGH risks with meaningful tail risk.
5. The thesis's own recommended entry (EUR 290-305) implicitly acknowledges the current price is not compelling.

**This does NOT mean Ferrari is a bad investment.** It means Ferrari at EUR 323 is not a good ENTRY POINT for a value investor who demands margin of safety. At EUR 280-290, the calculus changes materially.

## Adjusted Adversarial Fair Value

Using more conservative (but defensible) assumptions:

| Method | Adversarial FV | Change vs Thesis | Rationale |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|
| OEY | EUR 310 | -20 from EUR 330 | Use 5% growth (guidance) not 6.5% (above-guidance) |
| EV/EBIT | EUR 350 | -50 from EUR 400 | Use 28x (auto-luxury blend) not 32x (pure luxury) |
| P/E | EUR 340 | -30 from EUR 370 | Use 35x (below historical avg, reflecting growth reset) not 39x |
| **Weighted (30/40/30)** | **EUR 335** | **-42 from EUR 377** | |

**Adversarial Bear:** EUR 240 (22x forward EBIT with 26% margin)
**Adversarial Base:** EUR 335
**Adversarial Bull:** EUR 440 (36x, management beats guidance)

At current EUR 323: MoS vs adversarial base = 3.7%. **INADEQUATE.**
At EUR 290: MoS vs adversarial base = 15.5%. **MARGINAL.**
At EUR 270: MoS vs adversarial base = 24.1%. **ADEQUATE.**

---

## Adjusted Risk Score

**MEDIUM-HIGH** (upgrade from MEDIUM)

Rationale: 4 correlated HIGH risks, meaningful tail risk (10-15% probability of 40-50% loss), period of elevated execution uncertainty (5 model launches + first EV + tariffs). The strong moat and order book provide a floor, preventing a HIGH rating, but the multiple-dependent valuation amplifies any fundamental miss.

---

## Additional Kill Conditions to Add

The thesis lists 6 kill conditions. I would add:

7. **P/E sustained below 30x for 6+ months.** This would signal the market has permanently re-classified Ferrari from "luxury" to "premium auto," which would invalidate the entire multiple-based valuation framework.

8. **FY2026 revenue misses EUR 7.3B** (below the guided EUR 7.5B by more than EUR 200M). This would be the first revenue miss in Ferrari's public history and would shatter the "management under-promises and over-delivers" narrative.

9. **Cumulative buyback at average price > 35x P/E with ROIC declining.** Buybacks at premium multiples during an ROIC plateau destroy shareholder value.

---

## Recomendacion al Investment Committee

### DISAGREE with purchase at EUR 323. CONDITIONAL AGREE at EUR 280-295.

**Specific recommendations:**

1. **Do NOT set a standing order at EUR 305.** The thesis's own entry recommendation of EUR 290-305 is the upper bound. Use EUR 280-295 for the standing order, consistent with adversarial FV of EUR 335 (MoS 15-20%) and closer to the Tier A precedent pattern.

2. **Do NOT approve a starter position at current price.** The MoS is inadequate by every precedent. "Nibbling" would break the discipline that has served the portfolio well.

3. **Require luxury goods sector view before any purchase.** Gate 0 (sector view exists) is not met.

4. **If entering at EUR 280-295:** Size at 3% initial (conservative end of Tier A precedent range), given: (a) elevated execution risk in 2026, (b) tariff uncertainty through June, (c) Luce launch is untested.

5. **Monitor these catalysts before buying:**
   - Luce exterior reveal (May 2026): gauge market/customer reaction
   - Q1 2026 results: does revenue/margin track guidance?
   - US tariff resolution or escalation (June 1 deadline)

## 🔄 META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres
- The "luxury vs auto" classification is genuinely ambiguous. Ferrari IS more luxury than auto, but it is not AS luxury as Hermes. The appropriate multiple is somewhere between 25x and 40x -- a range too wide for confident point estimation. I scored this HIGH, not CRITICAL, because both the thesis and I acknowledge this ambiguity.
- The order book extending to end-2027 is a REAL moat advantage that I may be underweighting. If demand remains solid post-2027, the pricing power narrative holds. I have no way to assess post-2027 demand with current information.
- My adversarial FV of EUR 335 uses 28x EV/EBIT, which may be too conservative for a company with ROIC 25% and net cash. If 30x is more appropriate, FV moves to EUR 365 and MoS at EUR 290 = 26% (closer to Tier A precedent).

### Limitaciones de Este Analisis
- Could not access Seeking Alpha full articles (403 errors). The "Back to Square One" and CMD disappointment analyses were only available as search result summaries.
- Did not independently verify Ferrari's "industrial FCF" figure of EUR 1,538M vs GAAP FCF. The thesis's FCF normalization is a key input that I relied on rather than independently calculating.
- Did not model the tariff impact quantitatively (margin compression from 25% tariff on 29% of revenue). This would require more detailed cost structure data.
- The insider ownership figure of 30.5% (Exor + Piero Ferrari) is not "insider" in the traditional sense -- it is family/holding company ownership. True management insider ownership (CEO, CFO buying with personal funds) may be much lower.

### Sugerencias para el Sistema
- **Create a "multiple sensitivity" quick tool** that takes EBIT, EPS, net debt, and shares and outputs a matrix. Currently this is done manually in every valuation, wasting time and introducing errors.
- **The OEY method needs a documented decision framework for cases where OEY + Growth < WACC.** The current skill says to use OEY as primary for Tier A, but does not address what to do when OEY says "fairly valued" and multiples say "undervalued." The valuation-specialist resolved this by giving OEY only 20% weight -- but this undermines the Tier A methodology.
- **The 96% dividend yield from yfinance for RACE.MI** was flagged by THREE agents (thesis, moat, risk). This should be a priority fix in data validation.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator
1. **Given OEY + Growth < WACC and MoS 17% (vs 34% precedent), is there any argument for buying at current price?** I cannot find one that doesn't require breaking established precedents.
2. **Should the OEY method be given 50% weight (as mandated for Tier A) or is there a valid reason to deviate for luxury compounders?** If we deviate, we should document why and update the valuation-methods skill.
3. **The thesis and valuation report both recommend entry at EUR 290-305. The adversarial view is EUR 280-295. Should the standing order use the overlap (EUR 290-295)?**
