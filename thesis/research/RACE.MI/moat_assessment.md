# Moat Assessment: RACE.MI (Ferrari N.V.)

## Date: 2026-02-11

## Classification: WIDE MOAT -- Score: 23/25

Ferrari possesses one of the widest and most durable economic moats in global equities. It operates not as an automaker but as a luxury goods company that happens to make cars, more analogous to Hermes than to Porsche. The moat is derived from at least three independently powerful and mutually reinforcing sources, all with 20+ year durability horizons.

---

## Sources of Moat Identified

| Source | Present | Strength (1-5) | Evidence | Durability | Trajectory |
|--------|---------|-----------------|----------|------------|------------|
| Cost advantage | NO | 1 | Not a cost leader; high R&D (~15% of rev), single Maranello plant. Low volume = no scale economies. The strategy is ANTI-scale. | N/A | N/A |
| Network effects | YES (weak/indirect) | 2 | Community/aspirational effect. Ferrari Owners Club. 81% repeat purchase rate. Exclusivity creates social signaling value. Not a traditional network effect. | 20+ years | Stable |
| Intangible assets | YES (dominant) | 5 | 80+ year brand, F1 heritage, EUR 10.8B brand value. Pricing power: raised prices 10% on US tariff with zero demand impact. GM ~50% vs sector 35%. Personalization driving ASP growth with flat deliveries. | 30+ years | Expanding |
| Switching costs | YES (strong) | 4 | Waitlist 20-24 months. 81% of sales to repeat buyers. 71.4% owner return rate (highest of ANY automaker). Allocation system requires purchase history. Community/club creates social lock-in. | 20+ years | Expanding |
| Efficient scale | YES (moderate) | 3 | Ultra-luxury segment is naturally limited (~13,000-14,000 unit niche). Ferrari deliberately caps production below demand. No new entrant can credibly enter this exact niche -- Rimac Nevera struggles to sell 150 units. The segment is too small for multiple profitable players at Ferrari's margin level. | 20+ years | Stable |

**Total sources present:** 3 strong (Intangibles, Switching Costs, Efficient Scale) + 1 weak (indirect network effects)
**Average strength of present sources:** 3.5/5

## Quantitative Evidence

### Returns on Capital vs WACC

| Metric | Ferrari | Peer Median (Auto) | Difference |
|--------|---------|---------------------|------------|
| ROIC (4yr avg, tool) | 22.0% | ~8-10% | +12-14pp |
| ROIC (latest 2024) | 24.9% | ~8-10% | +15-17pp |
| ROIC 5yr avg (external) | 19.2% (YCharts) | ~8-10% | +9-12pp |
| ROIC 10yr avg | 18.0% | ~8-10% | +8-10pp |
| WACC (tool) | 10.0% | ~9-10% | Similar |
| ROIC-WACC Spread | +14.9pp | ~0pp | +14.9pp |

**ROIC Persistence:** ROIC has exceeded WACC in every year since IPO (2016-2024). Not a single year below WACC. 9/9 years > WACC = maximum persistence score.

**ROIC Trajectory:** IMPROVING. From 20.3% (2021) to 24.9% (2024). The moat is WIDENING, not stable.

### Margins vs Peers

| Metric | Ferrari | Porsche | Lamborghini | Aston Martin | Auto Sector Median |
|--------|---------|---------|-------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Gross Margin | ~50% | ~28% | ~38% | ~28% | ~35% |
| Operating Margin | 28-30% | 14% | 27% | Negative | 7.7% |
| EBITDA Margin | 38.8% | ~20% | ~30% | ~5% | ~12% |
| FCF Margin | 14.0% | ~5% | N/A | Negative | ~5% |

**Gross margin premium vs sector median: +15pp.** This is among the highest in the entire automotive universe and puts Ferrari firmly in luxury goods territory.

### Pricing Power Evidence (Most Critical Moat Indicator)

| Year | Deliveries | Revenue | Revenue/Unit (Implied ASP) | Comment |
|------|-----------|---------|----------------------------|---------|
| 2021 | 11,155 | EUR 4.3B | EUR 385K | Baseline |
| 2022 | 13,221 | EUR 5.1B | EUR 386K | Volume growth + flat ASP |
| 2023 | 13,663 | EUR 6.0B | EUR 439K | ASP inflection +14% |
| 2024 | 13,752 | EUR 6.7B | EUR 487K | ASP +11% |
| 2025 | 13,640 | EUR 7.1B | EUR 521K | ASP +7%, flat volume DELIBERATE |

**Compounding ASP at ~10% annually while holding volume flat = extraordinary pricing power.** This is the Hermes playbook. Revenue grows NOT from selling more cars, but from selling the SAME number at higher prices (personalization, mix, price increases).

**Tariff test (March 2025):** Ferrari raised US prices 10% (up to USD 50,000 per car) in response to Trump tariffs. Zero demand impact. Order book extends to end of 2027. This is the ultimate pricing power test -- and they passed it.

### Balance Sheet Strength

| Metric | Value | Comment |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Net Debt/EBITDA | Net Cash | Exceptional |
| Interest Coverage | 48.2x | Fortress |
| Industrial FCF 2025 | EUR 1,538M | +50% YoY |
| Insider Ownership | 30.5% | High alignment (Exor/Agnelli family) |

## Ferrari vs Hermes: The Luxury Moat Comparison

| Dimension | Ferrari | Hermes | Verdict |
|-----------|---------|--------|---------|
| Gross Margin | ~50% | ~70% | Hermes higher (no R&D/factory equivalent) |
| ROIC | ~25% | ~35-40% | Hermes higher (asset-lighter) |
| Pricing Power | Raises prices 5-10%/yr, no demand impact | Same | Comparable |
| Scarcity Management | Production capped ~13,600 units | Birkin waitlists | Comparable |
| Brand Heritage | 80+ years, F1, Enzo legend | 187 years, artisan craft | Both extraordinary |
| Repeat Purchase | 81% to existing owners | Very high | Comparable |
| Resale Value | Many models appreciate | Birkin appreciates | Comparable |
| R&D Requirement | ~15% of revenue (F1, EV transition) | Minimal | Ferrari DISADVANTAGE |
| Capital Intensity | High (factory, EV investment) | Low | Ferrari DISADVANTAGE |

**Conclusion:** Ferrari's moat is comparable to Hermes in brand power, scarcity, and pricing power. Where Ferrari trails is in capital intensity and margin profile due to the nature of automobile manufacturing vs leather goods. This is structural, not a moat weakness -- it simply means Ferrari will never achieve Hermes-level margins, but its moat within its domain is equally wide.

## Moat Durability Analysis

### Source 1: Intangible Assets (Brand + Heritage) -- 30+ Years

**Why it will last:**
- The Ferrari brand is 80+ years old and tied to Formula 1, which is experiencing a global renaissance (Netflix "Drive to Survive" effect). F1 viewership grew 50%+ since 2018.
- Brand value of EUR 10.8B. Only a handful of brands in any industry have this level of recognition and emotional resonance.
- The name "Ferrari" is synonymous with speed, luxury, and Italian craftsmanship. This association took 8 decades to build and cannot be replicated.
- Unlike tech moats, brand moats in luxury STRENGTHEN with age (cf. Hermes, Patek Philippe, Rolex).

**What could destroy it:**
- Catastrophic quality failure (recall, safety scandal) -- LOW probability
- Diluting the brand by overproducing -- management has explicitly committed to the opposite
- F1 withdrawal or prolonged F1 failure -- MEDIUM-LOW probability (Ferrari is THE iconic F1 team; withdrawal would be brand-damaging but F1 is profitable for Ferrari)

### Source 2: Switching Costs (Community + Allocation) -- 20+ Years

**Why it will last:**
- 81% of sales go to existing owners. To buy certain models (LaFerrari successors, limited editions), you MUST have a purchase history. This creates a flywheel: buy a Portofino to eventually qualify for a Daytona SP3.
- Ferrari Owners Club and exclusive events (Cavalcade, Finali Mondiali) create social community that no competitor can replicate.
- 71.4% owner return rate -- highest of ANY car brand, even surpassing mass-market loyalty leaders.
- Waitlist of 20-24 months creates emotional investment before delivery.

**What could destroy it:**
- Competing ultra-luxury brand creating comparable allocation system -- but who? No one has the heritage.
- Demographic shift: Ultra-HNWI preferences shifting away from cars entirely -- LOW probability given rising UHNWI population globally.

### Source 3: Efficient Scale -- 20+ Years

**Why it will last:**
- The "ultra-luxury sports car producing <15,000 units with F1 heritage" market is a niche that rationally supports ONE dominant player.
- Lamborghini is closest competitor but produces ~9,000 units at lower margins and is owned by VW/Audi (less exclusivity control).
- Aston Martin has tried and failed repeatedly to replicate the model (negative operating margin, multiple near-bankruptcies).
- McLaren is privately held, struggles financially, and produces ~4,700 units.
- Rimac makes 150 units and cannot find buyers for electric hypercars.
- No new entrant has credibly entered this space in decades.

**What could destroy it:**
- A tech billionaire creating a new ultra-luxury brand from scratch with unlimited capital -- but even Tesla, the most successful car startup in a century, targets volume, not exclusivity.

## Threats to the Moat

| Threat | Probability | Impact | Horizon | Detail |
|--------|-------------|--------|---------|--------|
| EV transition diluting ICE brand identity | Medium-Low | Medium | 3-7 years | Ferrari Luce is a four-door EV, not a supercar. Risk: broadening into less exclusive segment. MITIGANT: Only 5% of sales projected as EV in 2026. CEO confirmed EV ownership not required for special allocations. Jony Ive collaboration adds design credibility. |
| US/EU tariff escalation | Low | Low | 1-3 years | Already demonstrated ability to pass through 10% price increase with zero demand destruction. 50bps EBITDA margin risk was subsequently resolved via US-EU agreement. 100% Maranello production is a brand asset, not a liability. |
| Chinese luxury demand slowdown | Medium | Low-Medium | 1-5 years | China is ~10% of deliveries. Not a dominant market. Greater China revenue mix is manageable. CATL battery partnership for EV hedges this somewhat. |
| F1 loss of competitiveness or relevance | Low | Medium | 5-15 years | F1 is in a golden age of viewership. Ferrari is THE iconic team. Lewis Hamilton joined for 2025 season, boosting global attention. F1 contract secure through 2030s. |
| Overproduction/brand dilution by management | Very Low | Very High | Perpetual | The greatest existential risk. However, current management (CEO Vigna) and controlling shareholder (Exor/Elkann family) have consistently demonstrated commitment to scarcity. 13,640 units in 2025 = essentially flat since 2022. |
| Competitor creates comparable luxury platform | Very Low | High | 10-20 years | No automaker has the heritage, F1 connection, and cultural capital to replicate Ferrari. Porsche is the closest and it is a volume player (306,000 units). Lamborghini is closest in positioning but lacks the F1 heritage and independent brand control. |

## Erosion Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Brand Dilution Through Over-Expansion (Most Probable -- but still low probability)
If Ferrari were to increase production significantly (e.g., to 20,000+ units) driven by short-term profit pressure, the scarcity premium would erode. This is what happened to Maserati under FCA, which destroyed its brand by chasing volume. **Probability: ~10% over next 10 years.** The Elkann family's 30.5% stake and Exor's long-term orientation is the strongest protection against this. Ferrari's entire business model depends on NOT doing this.

### Scenario 2: EV Transition Mismanagement (Tail Risk)
If the Ferrari Luce is poorly received (performance, sound, driving feel fails to meet expectations), it could create a narrative that Ferrari "doesn't get EVs." This could be compounded if a competitor (e.g., a new brand backed by a tech company) creates an aspirational EV that captures the imagination of next-generation UHNWI. **Probability: ~15% over next 10 years.** MITIGANT: Ferrari is taking a cautious, Hermes-like approach -- the Luce is positioned as one product line, not a pivot. Only 5% of sales. And they are investing EUR 4.29B in EV capability.

### Scenario 3: Secular Shift Away from Combustion Engine Cars Making Ferrari "Irrelevant" (Deep Tail Risk)
In a world where ICE cars are socially unacceptable (regulatory bans + cultural shift), Ferrari's heritage becomes a liability rather than asset. **Probability: <5% in next 20 years.** MITIGANT: Luxury goods are typically exempt from utilitarian regulation (no one banned private jets). Ferrari's emissions are negligible in global terms. And Ferrari is actively developing electric and hybrid platforms.

## ROIC vs Peers (Quantitative Moat Evidence)

| Company | ROIC (Latest) | ROIC 5yr Avg | Gross Margin | Op Margin | Verdict |
|---------|---------------|--------------|--------------|-----------|---------|
| **Ferrari** | **24.9%** | **~19-22%** | **~50%** | **28-30%** | **Wide moat** |
| Porsche AG | ~10-12% | ~12% | ~28% | ~14% | Narrow moat |
| Lamborghini (VW) | ~15% | ~12% | ~38% | ~27% | Narrow moat |
| Aston Martin | Negative | Negative | ~28% | Negative | No moat |
| McLaren | N/A (private) | N/A | ~20% | Near-zero | No moat |

Ferrari's ROIC is 2-3x that of its closest luxury auto competitor and has been consistently above WACC for its entire public history (2016-2025).

## Discrepancies with Thesis (if applicable)

No thesis exists yet for RACE.MI. This moat assessment is the first independent analysis in the research pipeline. The moat classification of WIDE with score 23/25 should inform subsequent valuation work.

**Key input for valuation-specialist:** The strength and durability of the moat justifies using a lower WACC and higher terminal growth rate than a typical auto manufacturer. Ferrari should be valued as a luxury goods company, not an automaker. Comparable multiples should reference Hermes (RMS.PA), LVMH, and Brunello Cucinelli rather than Porsche or BMW.

## Summary

Ferrari possesses one of the widest economic moats in global equities, driven by three independently powerful and mutually reinforcing sources:

1. **Intangible Assets (Brand + Heritage):** 80+ years, F1 connection, EUR 10.8B brand value, demonstrated pricing power (10% increase with zero demand impact). Strength: 5/5, Durability: 30+ years, Trajectory: EXPANDING.

2. **Switching Costs (Community + Allocation):** 81% sales to repeat buyers, 71.4% return rate, allocation-gated access to special models, 20-24 month waitlists. Strength: 4/5, Durability: 20+ years, Trajectory: EXPANDING.

3. **Efficient Scale (Natural Monopoly in Ultra-Luxury):** ~13,600 unit niche with no credible new entrant in decades. Competitors either operate at lower margins (Lamborghini) or lose money (Aston Martin, McLaren). Strength: 3/5, Durability: 20+ years, Trajectory: STABLE.

**Moat Classification: WIDE (23/25)**
**Moat Trend: EXPANDING** -- Pricing power is increasing (ASP compounding at ~10%/yr), margins are expanding (EBIT margin +120bps YoY to 29.5%), and ROIC is at all-time highs (24.9%).

The only legitimate moat risk is self-inflicted (overproduction/brand dilution), and current ownership structure (Exor/Elkann at 30.5%) provides strong protection against this.

## Meta-Reflection

### Doubts/Uncertainties
- **EV margin profile:** I could not find explicit data on what margins Ferrari expects from the Luce EV specifically. If EV margins are materially lower than ICE, the margin expansion narrative reverses as EV mix increases over time. This warrants monitoring.
- **China exposure granularity:** China is ~10% of deliveries, but I could not verify the exact revenue percentage (given higher ASP of models sold in China, revenue share may differ from unit share).
- **Personalization percentage:** Ferrari does not explicitly disclose what percentage of revenue comes from personalization options. Industry estimates suggest it is a growing and high-margin stream, but without hard numbers this is partially assumption-based.
- **Quality Score tool gap:** The tool reports Market Position as 0/8 (manual input needed). I would score this 8/8 -- Ferrari is the undisputed #1 in ultra-luxury sports cars.

### Suggestions for the System
- Ferrari should be benchmarked against luxury goods peers (Hermes, LVMH, Brunello Cucinelli) in the quality_scorer tool, not against Auto Manufacturers sector median. The "Consumer Cyclical / Auto Manufacturers" classification fundamentally misrepresents Ferrari's competitive dynamics.
- Consider creating a "luxury goods" sector view under `world/sectors/` that includes Ferrari, Hermes, LVMH, etc., rather than placing Ferrari in an automotive sector view.

### Questions for Orchestrator
1. Should the valuation-specialist use luxury goods multiples (40-50x earnings) rather than auto multiples (8-15x earnings) when valuing Ferrari? The moat evidence strongly supports the luxury framework.
2. Ferrari's current P/E is ~35x (at EUR 322.80, down 35% from high). At what point does the "luxury premium" valuation become justified vs excessive? This is the core tension for the buy decision.
3. Should we create a dedicated "luxury goods" sector view that captures Ferrari + Hermes + LVMH dynamics, or is this better handled within sector-specific views?
