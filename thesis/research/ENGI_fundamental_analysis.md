# ENGIE (ENGI.PA) - Fundamental Analysis

**Analyst**: Claude (Value Investor System)
**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Current Price**: EUR 23.84
**Position Size**: EUR 400-500 (2.4-3.0% of EUR 16,700 portfolio)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**VERDICT: HOLD / WATCHLIST -- Do NOT buy at EUR 23.84**

Engie is a high-quality European utility trading at a reasonable P/E (11.7x) with an attractive 6.6% dividend yield. However, it **fails** the margin of safety test (0-10% vs required >25%) and the **FCF dividend coverage test** (0.86x vs required >1.2x). The dividend is covered by earnings (payout 65%) but NOT by free cash flow due to EUR 10B/year capex intensity. The stock is fairly valued, not undervalued.

**Key Conclusion**: Engie is a decent income stock but NOT a value buy at current levels. Wait for EUR 17-19 (25-30% margin) or a material deterioration in capex that frees up FCF.

## 3. Key Financial Metrics

### Income Statement Trends (2021-2024)

| Metric | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | Trend |
|--------|------|------|------|------|-------|
| Revenue (EUR B) | ~58 | ~94 | ~83 | 73.8 | Declining (energy price normalization) |
| EBITDA ex-Nuclear (EUR B) | ~14 | ~13 | ~13.7 | 13.4 | Stable (~EUR 13-14B range) |
| Net Recurring Income (EUR B) | -- | -- | 5.4 | 5.5 | Stable/growing |
| Net Income (EUR B) | -- | -- | -- | 4.1 | -- |
| EPS (EUR) | -- | -- | ~2.22 | ~2.27 | Stable |

**Assessment**: Revenue declining is cosmetic (energy commodity pass-through normalizing). EBITDA and net recurring income are stable, which is what matters. EBITDA has been in the EUR 13-14B range for 3 years -- a mature, predictable business.

### H1 2025 Update
- Revenue: EUR 38.1B (+1.4% gross, +2.9% organic)
- EBITDA: EUR 8.3B (-7.4% gross, -5.5% organic)
- Net Recurring Income: EUR 3.1B (vs EUR 3.8B H1 2024)
- CFFO: EUR 8.4B (-EUR 0.5B vs H1 2024)
- **2025 Guidance (upgraded)**: Net recurring income EUR 4.4-5.0B, EBIT ex-nuclear upper half EUR 8.0-9.0B

**Assessment**: H1 2025 shows declining profitability vs H1 2024 (high base from energy crisis). Guidance at upper end suggests FY2025 NRI ~EUR 4.7-5.0B. This means a **~10% decline** in NRI from 2024's EUR 5.5B -- the nuclear phase-out impact hitting.

### 2025 Guidance Implication for Dividend
- NRI 2025E: EUR 4.4-5.0B (midpoint EUR 4.7B)
- At 65% payout: EUR 3.05B = EUR 1.26/share
- At 75% payout: EUR 3.53B = EUR 1.45/share
- Floor: EUR 1.10/share (raised from EUR 0.65)
- **Risk**: 2025 dividend could be EUR 1.26-1.45 vs 2024's EUR 1.48. Possible FLAT or slight CUT.

## 4. Dividend Sustainability Analysis (CRITICAL)

### Validation 1: FCF Coverage of Dividend

| Metric | 2023 | 2024 | H1 2025 Ann. | 2026E |
|--------|------|------|-------------|-------|
| CFFO (EUR B) | 13.1 | 13.1 | ~16.8* | -- |
| Total Capex (EUR B) | 10.6 | 10.0 | ~6.6* | ~10.0 |
| **Free Cash Flow (EUR B)** | **~2.5** | **~3.1** | -- | **~3.9** |
| Total Dividends (EUR B) | ~3.4 | ~3.6 | -- | ~3.6 |
| **FCF / Dividend** | **~0.74x** | **~0.86x** | -- | **~1.08x** |

*H1 annualized not meaningful due to capex seasonality

**FAIL: FCF coverage 0.74-0.86x in 2023-2024 is BELOW the 1.2x threshold.**

Even the analyst estimate of EUR 3.86B FCF in 2026 only gives 1.08x coverage. The dividend is being partially funded by debt/asset sales, not purely by cash generation after capex.

**Mitigating factor**: Engie's capex is heavily growth-oriented (EUR 7.3B of EUR 10.0B total capex in 2024 was growth capex). Maintenance capex is only ~EUR 2.7B. If we use CFFO minus maintenance capex: EUR 13.1B - EUR 2.7B = EUR 10.4B -- dividend is trivially covered. However, this is a generous interpretation; growth capex is not optional for a utility transitioning to renewables.

### Validation 2: Payout Ratio

| Metric | 2024 |
|--------|------|
| Net Recurring Income | EUR 5.5B |
| Total Dividends | EUR 3.59B |
| **Payout Ratio** | **65%** |

**PASS: Payout ratio 65% is well below the 75-80% threshold.** Policy is 65-75% with EUR 1.10 floor.

### Validation 3: Dividend History

| Year | DPS (EUR) | Yield (approx) |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 2021 | 0.85 | -- |
| 2022 | 1.40 | -- |
| 2023 | 1.43 | -- |
| 2024 | 1.48 | 6.2-6.8% |

**Growing dividend**, raised floor from EUR 0.65 to EUR 1.10. Positive trajectory.

### Dividend Verdict

The dividend is **covered by earnings** (65% payout, conservative) but **NOT covered by FCF** (0.86x) due to massive capex. This is a structural feature of utilities in transition (EUR 22-25B growth capex 2023-2025). The dividend is sustainable IF:
- Earnings remain at EUR 5B+ (currently guided EUR 4.4-5.0B for 2025)
- Capex eventually generates returns (renewables IRR must exceed WACC)
- Balance sheet can absorb the gap (net debt/EBITDA 3.1x, target <4.0x, headroom exists)

**Risk**: If NRI drops below EUR 4B (e.g., energy price crash, regulatory hit), dividend at 65% payout = EUR 1.07/share (below floor but policy says floor EUR 1.10). The floor provides a backstop but at cost of higher payout ratio.

---

## 5. Balance Sheet & Debt

| Metric | 2024 | Target |
|--------|------|--------|
| Net Financial Debt | EUR 33.2B | -- |
| Economic Net Debt | EUR 47.9B | -- |
| EBITDA ex-Nuclear | EUR 13.4B | -- |
| **Eco. Net Debt / EBITDA** | **3.1x** | **<4.0x** |
| Net Fin. Debt / EBITDA | 2.1x | -- |
| Liquidity | EUR 25.5B | -- |
| Credit Rating (S&P) | BBB+ / Stable | Investment grade |

**PASS: Debt/EBITDA 3.1x is below 4x threshold, with 0.9x headroom.**

The balance sheet is solid for a utility. EUR 25.5B liquidity provides massive buffer. S&P expects EBITDA to stabilize at EUR 14-14.5B in 2025-2027. The nuclear waste transfer (EUR 15B to Belgian state) removes a major tail risk.

**Concern**: S&P anticipates negative free cash flow (after dividends, acquisitions, disposals) of ~EUR 1.1B annually. This means net debt is GROWING, not shrinking. The 3.1x ratio holds because EBITDA is growing too, but this is not a deleveraging story.

---

## 6. Valuation

### Method 1: DCF (Conservative)

**Assumptions** (applying investment rules: management guidance -20-30%, terminal growth <= GDP):

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| FCF Base | EUR 3.1B (2024) | Actual |
| FCF Growth Years 1-5 | 5% p.a. | Renewables ramp, but haircut from analyst 8-10% |
| FCF Growth Years 6-10 | 3% p.a. | Mature utility |
| Terminal Growth | 2.0% | Below EU GDP, conservative |
| WACC | 8.0% | Minimum for established utility |
| Shares | 2.425B | Current |

| Year | FCF (EUR B) |
|------|-------------|
| 2025 | 3.26 |
| 2026 | 3.42 |
| 2027 | 3.59 |
| 2028 | 3.77 |
| 2029 | 3.96 |
| 2030 | 4.08 |
| 2031 | 4.20 |
| 2032 | 4.33 |
| 2033 | 4.46 |
| 2034 | 4.59 |

PV of FCFs (Years 1-10) at 8% WACC: ~EUR 26.4B
Terminal Value: EUR 4.59 * 1.02 / (0.08 - 0.02) = EUR 78.0B
PV of Terminal Value: EUR 78.0 / (1.08^10) = EUR 36.1B
**Enterprise Value**: EUR 62.5B
Less Economic Net Debt: EUR 47.9B
**Equity Value**: EUR 14.6B
**Per Share**: EUR 6.02

This conservative DCF gives an extremely low value because economic net debt (EUR 47.9B) is enormous relative to the FCF the business generates. Using net financial debt (EUR 33.2B) instead:

**Equity Value**: EUR 62.5B - EUR 33.2B = EUR 29.3B
**Per Share**: EUR 12.09

### Method 1B: DCF (Moderate -- Using CFFO minus Maintenance Capex)

Using CFFO EUR 13.1B - Maintenance Capex EUR 2.7B = EUR 10.4B as "owner earnings":

PV of CFs at 8% WACC (10 years, 3% growth, 2% terminal): ~EUR 76B
Less net financial debt EUR 33.2B = EUR 43B
**Per Share**: EUR 17.73

### Method 2: Comparables / Multiples

| Method | Multiple | Earnings/CF Base | Fair Value/Share |
|--------|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| P/E (sector avg 14x) | 14.0x | NRI EUR 5.5B / 2.425B = EUR 2.27 | **EUR 31.78** |
| P/E (Engie 5yr avg ~12x) | 12.0x | EUR 2.27 | **EUR 27.24** |
| P/E (2025E NRI midpoint) | 12.0x | EUR 4.7B / 2.425B = EUR 1.94 | **EUR 23.28** |
| EV/EBITDA (current 6.0x) | 6.0x | EUR 13.4B | EV EUR 80.4B - 33.2B = EUR 47.2B / 2.425B = **EUR 19.46** |
| EV/EBITDA (sector 9.9x) | 9.9x | EUR 13.4B | EV EUR 132.7B - 33.2B = EUR 99.5B / 2.425B = **EUR 41.03** |
| Dividend Yield (5% norm) | 5.0% yield | EUR 1.48 DPS | **EUR 29.60** |

### Valuation Summary

| Method | Fair Value (EUR/share) |
|--------|----------------------|
| DCF Conservative (eco. net debt) | 6.02 |
| DCF Conservative (fin. net debt) | 12.09 |
| DCF Moderate (owner earnings) | 17.73 |
| Comparable P/E 12x (2024 NRI) | 27.24 |
| Comparable P/E 12x (2025E NRI) | 23.28 |
| Comparable EV/EBITDA 6x | 19.46 |
| Analyst consensus | 22-24.83 |

**Central Fair Value Estimate**: EUR 19-24 range (wide dispersion reflects debt complexity)

**Best estimate**: EUR 21-23 (weighted toward EV/EBITDA and forward P/E methods, which properly account for debt).

**Margin of Safety at EUR 23.84**: 0% to -12% (OVERVALUED to FAIR)

**Required entry for 25% margin**: EUR 21 * 0.75 = EUR 15.75 to EUR 23 * 0.75 = EUR 17.25

## 7. Moat Assessment

### Rating: NARROW MOAT

| Moat Source | Strength | Evidence |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Regulated Networks** | STRONG | French gas distribution/transmission monopoly. Regulated returns, high barriers to entry. ~EUR 3.5B investment by 2030. |
| **Scale in Renewables** | MODERATE | 46 GW installed (record +4.2 GW in 2024), target 95 GW by 2030. Top 5 globally. But renewables increasingly commoditized. |
| **Integrated Model** | MODERATE | Full value chain (generation, networks, trading, services). GEMS trading platform provides optimization advantage. |
| **Nuclear (Belgium)** | WEAK/NEUTRAL | Doel 4 + Tihange 3 extended 10 years via 50/50 JV. CfD mechanism limits upside/downside. Nuclear waste liability transferred (EUR 15B) -- removes tail risk. |
| **Switching Costs** | WEAK | B2B energy services have some switching costs, but commodity energy has minimal. |
| **Brand / Government** | WEAK | French state 23.6% ownership provides implicit support but also political interference risk. |

**Moat Durability**: Networks moat is durable (decades). Renewables moat is eroding as capital floods in. Nuclear is finite (10-year extension). Overall, a narrow moat with the networks segment as the anchor.

## 8. Risk Assessment

### HIGH Impact Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **FCF insufficiency for dividend** | HIGH | Dividend flat/cut if capex stays EUR 10B+ and NRI drops | Floor EUR 1.10, 65% payout policy conservative |
| **French political interference** | MEDIUM-HIGH | Windfall taxes, price caps, energy policy shifts. France fiscal deficit 5.5% GDP, budget chaos | Diversified across 31 countries, only ~40% France revenue |
| **NRI decline 2025-2026** | HIGH | Nuclear contribution drops; guided EUR 4.4-5.0B vs 2024 EUR 5.5B = -10% decline | Renewables growth partially offsets; 2027 recovery guided EUR 4.4-5.0B |
| **Energy price normalization** | MEDIUM | Lower commodity prices = lower GEMS trading profits | Hedging, contracted renewables, regulated networks provide floor |

### MEDIUM Impact Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Capex execution risk** | MEDIUM | EUR 22-25B capex 2023-25 must deliver IRR > WACC | 84% in renewables with long-term PPAs |
| **Interest rate sensitivity** | MEDIUM | EUR 33B net debt; rising rates increase cost | BBB+ rating, EUR 25.5B liquidity, diversified maturities |
| **Gas demand secular decline** | MEDIUM-HIGH | Electrification erodes gas network volumes | Pivoting to hydrogen (4 GW by 2035), renewable gases |
| **Belgium nuclear costs** | LOW (now) | EUR 15B waste liability transferred to Belgian state March 2025 | Risk largely eliminated by agreement |

### LOW Impact Risks
- Technology disruption (distributed generation) -- long-term, utility scale still dominant
- China competition in renewables equipment -- Engie is operator not manufacturer

---

## 9. Autocritica (Mandatory Self-Assessment)

### Assumptions Made
1. Used CFFO EUR 13.1B and total capex EUR 10.0B for FCF calculation -- official figures but CFFO definition may differ from standard OCF
2. Assumed EUR 2.7B maintenance capex estimate (total EUR 10B - growth EUR 7.3B) -- rough calculation
3. DCF heavily penalized by EUR 47.9B economic net debt -- reasonable but some analysts use financial net debt
4. Assumed 2025 NRI midpoint EUR 4.7B for forward P/E -- management says "upper end" which could be EUR 5.0B

### Biases Detected
1. **Yield attraction bias**: 6.6% yield is emotionally appealing, may cause underweighting of FCF coverage failure
2. **Anchoring to screening**: Screening said "best value" -- could create confirmation bias in analysis
3. **Complexity avoidance**: Engie's balance sheet (economic vs financial net debt, nuclear liabilities) is complex; may oversimplify

### Evidence That Challenges the Thesis
1. S&P expects negative free cash flow after dividends/disposals of EUR 1.1B annually -- net debt growing
2. NRI dropping from EUR 5.5B (2024) to EUR 4.4-5.0B (2025) due to nuclear phase-out -- earnings declining
3. Analyst consensus EUR 22-24 = stock already AT fair value, no upside
4. France political instability (fiscal deficit, windfall tax risk) could compress multiples further

### Information I Could Not Validate
- Exact maintenance vs growth capex split (used approximation)
- FCF projections for 2026E (analyst estimate EUR 3.86B -- only one source)
- Forward payout ratio if NRI drops to EUR 4.4B

---

## 10. Investment Decision

### Scorecard

| Criterion | Required | Actual | Pass/Fail |
|-----------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Margin of safety >25% | >25% | 0-10% | **FAIL** |
| FCF coverage of dividend >1.2x | >1.2x | 0.86x (2024) | **FAIL** |
| Payout ratio <75-80% | <75% | 65% | PASS |
| Debt/EBITDA <4x | <4x | 3.1x | PASS |
| Moat identified | Narrow+ | Narrow | PASS |
| Thesis documented | Yes | Yes | PASS |
| Position <7% portfolio | <7% | 3% | PASS |

**DECISION: DO NOT BUY at EUR 23.84**

The stock fails on the two most critical tests:
1. **No margin of safety** -- trading at or above fair value (EUR 21-24 range)
2. **FCF does not cover dividend** -- 0.86x coverage means dividend partially funded by balance sheet

### Entry Triggers (Future)

| Trigger | Target Price | Margin of Safety |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Price drops to EUR 17-18 | EUR 17-18 | 22-26% vs fair value EUR 23 |
| NRI recovers to EUR 5.5B+ AND capex moderates to EUR 8B | Recalculate | FCF improves to EUR 5B+, coverage >1.3x |
| Analyst FCF 2026 EUR 3.86B materializes + price EUR 20 | EUR 20 | 15% margin + 1.08x FCF coverage improving |

### What Would Change My Mind
1. Capex cycle ends (2025 target met) and maintenance mode begins -- FCF doubles
2. Price correction to EUR 17-18 on French political crisis -- creates margin of safety
3. 2025 earnings beat upper guidance (NRI EUR 5.2B+) AND capex undershoots

### Comparison to Alternatives
- **Pfizer (PFE)**: Already own, 6.84% yield, P/E 14.8x, wide moat -- similar yield, better quality
- **Enel (ENEL.MI)**: Watchlist at EUR 7-7.50, P/E 9.6x, lower debt -- better value IF it drops
- **Naturgy (NTGY.MC)**: Needs separate analysis -- potentially better value (25% margin vs intrinsic)
- **Cash**: 5% in money market while waiting for better opportunities

---

## 11. Summary for Portfolio Owner

**Engie is a quality utility with an attractive 6.6% yield, BUT it is not cheap enough to buy.**

The stock trades at fair value (EUR 23.84 vs fair value EUR 21-24). The dividend looks sustainable on an earnings basis (65% payout) but fails the FCF test (0.86x) because Engie is spending EUR 10B/year on capex for its renewables transition. The balance sheet is solid (3.1x debt/EBITDA) but net debt is growing, not shrinking.

**Recommendation**: Place on WATCHLIST. Consider buying at EUR 17-18 (25% margin) or if a catalyst materially improves FCF (capex moderation post-2025, earnings recovery 2027).

**Next Actions**:
1. Add ENGI.PA to watchlist with alert at EUR 18.00
2. Monitor FY2025 results (Feb/Mar 2026) for NRI and capex trajectory
3. Proceed to analyze Naturgy (NTGY.MC) as alternative utility position
4. Re-evaluate if French political crisis creates EUR 17-18 entry
