# CMCSA (Comcast Corporation) - Investment Thesis

**Date:** 2026-02-01
**Analyst:** Fundamental Analyst Agent
**Tier:** B (Cyclical Quality - Media/Cable conglomerate)
**Required MoS:** >=25%
**Decision:** HOLD / WATCHLIST - Insufficient margin of safety at current price

---

## Executive Summary

Comcast is a diversified media and connectivity conglomerate trading at historically depressed multiples (P/E 5.5x, EV/EBITDA 5.1x, FCF yield 13-17%). The stock is cheap on headline metrics, but the discount reflects legitimate structural headwinds in its core broadband business ("Cord-Cutting 2.0") and ongoing Peacock streaming losses. Theme parks (Epic Universe) provide a bright spot but represent only ~10% of EBITDA. Aggressive capital return ($15B buyback + growing dividend) provides a floor, but the DCF suggests fair value near current price under conservative assumptions. The stock does not meet our 25% MoS threshold for Tier B.

## Key Metrics (as of 2026-02-01)

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Price | $29.75 (EUR 24.85) | -16% off 52w high |
| P/E (trailing) | 5.5x | Appears very cheap |
| P/E (forward) | 7.5x | Forward EPS ~$3.99 lower than trailing $5.39 |
| EV/EBITDA | 5.1x | Below peer CHTR (5.7x) |
| Dividend Yield | 4.4% | 19 consecutive increases |
| FCF Yield | 13-17% | Range: $14-18B FCF on $108B market cap |
| P/B | 1.1x | Near book value |
| D/E | 1.02 | $99B debt, manageable given EBITDA |
| ROE | 21.4% | Strong |
| Beta | 0.81 | Low beta, defensive characteristics |
| Market Cap | $108B (yfinance) / $117B (stated) | |
| Shares Outstanding | 3,634M | Declining ~5%/year via buybacks |

### Discrepancy Alert: P/E 5.5x vs Forward P/E 7.5x
Trailing EPS of $5.39 likely includes one-time items (asset sales, Versant spin-off adjustments). Forward EPS of ~$3.99 is more representative of ongoing earnings power. The "cheap P/E" headline is misleading. Using normalized earnings, the valuation is still reasonable but not as extreme as 5.5x suggests.

## Business Overview

### Segment Breakdown (2025)

**1. Connectivity & Platforms (~65% of revenue)**
- Broadband: 31.3M subscribers (declining ~500K/year)
- Wireless: 9M+ lines (growing 20%+ YoY, but ARPU much lower)
- Video: Secular decline, spinning off cable networks (Versant)
- Business Services: Stable, growing
- EBITDA margin: ~42%

**2. Content & Experiences (~30% of revenue)**
- Peacock: $7.6B revenue, still losing money ($552M loss Q4 2025)
- NBCUniversal: Broadcast, studios
- Theme Parks: $2.9B revenue Q4 (+22% YoY), EBITDA >$1B/quarter
- Epic Universe: Major growth catalyst, less cannibalization than expected

**3. Corporate & Other (~5%)**
- Sky (international), Xumo, Comcast Spectacor

### Versant Spin-Off (2025-2026)
Comcast is spinning off cable TV networks (USA, CNBC, MSNBC, SYFY, E!, etc.) into Versant Media Group. This removes low-growth legacy assets but also shifts more earnings pressure onto Peacock as the primary entertainment platform.

## Moat Assessment: NARROW MOAT (weakening)

### Moat Sources

**1. Infrastructure Monopoly (WEAKENING)**
- Historically, Comcast's broadband was a natural monopoly in many US markets
- Now facing overbuild from fiber (AT&T, regional players) and 5G FWA (T-Mobile, Verizon)
- 5G home internet added 932K subs in Q2 2025 alone industry-wide
- Comcast expects "most of its footprint will eventually be overbuilt"
- **Verdict:** Moat is eroding. Not a durable competitive advantage long-term.

**2. Content/IP (NBCUniversal, Universal Studios)**
- Strong IP portfolio: Jurassic World, Fast & Furious, Illumination, Harry Potter
- Theme parks monetize IP directly (Epic Universe proving this)
- NBC broadcast network, sports rights (NFL, NBA)
- **Verdict:** Moderate moat. IP is durable but content is hit-driven.

**3. Scale/Vertical Integration**
- Unique combination of distribution + content + parks
- Can cross-subsidize (bundle broadband + Peacock + wireless)
- $37B EBITDA gives financial muscle competitors lack
- **Verdict:** Real advantage, but complexity is also a drag.

**4. Switching Costs (Broadband)**
- Moderate switching costs (hassle, bundling)
- Eroding as 5G plug-and-play alternatives emerge
- **Verdict:** Declining.

### Overall Moat Score: 5/10 (NARROW, trending weaker)
The broadband monopoly that underpinned Comcast's value creation is structurally impaired. Theme parks and IP provide a secondary moat, but the core business faces permanent competitive headwinds.

## Valuation

### Method 1: DCF (7-year projection)

**Assumptions:**
- Base FCF: $14B (conservative; yfinance shows $12.5B for 2024, web TTM ~$18B)
- Net debt: $89.5B

| Scenario | Prob | Growth Y1-3 | Growth Y4-7 | Terminal G | WACC | Fair Value/Share |
|----------|------|-------------|-------------|-----------|------|-----------------|
| Bear | 25% | -2% | 0% | 1.5% | 10% | ~$15 |
| Base | 50% | +1% | +2% | 2.0% | 9% | ~$27 |
| Bull | 25% | +3% | +3% | 2.5% | 8.5% | ~$44 |

**Probability-Weighted DCF Fair Value: ~$28/share**

**MoS at $29.75: NEGATIVE (-6%)**

The stock is trading slightly ABOVE the probability-weighted DCF fair value. The large net debt ($89.5B) significantly reduces equity value from enterprise value.

### Method 2: EV/EBITDA Comparables

| Company | EV/EBITDA | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| CMCSA | 5.1x | Current |
| CHTR | 5.7x | Pure-play cable, higher leverage |
| DIS | ~13x | Premium for parks + streaming growth |
| WBD | ~8x | Turnaround story |
| Sector median (cable) | 5.5-6.5x | |

At 6.5x EBITDA (modest re-rating):
- EV = $240B, Equity = $150B, per share = **$41**
- MoS = 28%

At 6.0x EBITDA (no re-rating):
- EV = $221B, Equity = $132B, per share = **$36**
- MoS = 17%

### Method 3: FCF Yield / Capital Return

- Current FCF yield: 13-17% (depending on FCF estimate)
- Buyback: ~5% of shares/year ($15B authorization)
- Dividend: 4.4% yield, 19-year growth streak
- Total shareholder yield: ~9-10%/year

This is genuinely attractive and provides downside protection. Even if the stock goes nowhere, investors earn ~9-10% annually from capital return alone.

### Valuation Summary

| Method | Fair Value | MoS at $29.75 |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| DCF (weighted) | ~$28 | -6% (overvalued) |
| EV/EBITDA 6.0x | ~$36 | 17% |
| EV/EBITDA 6.5x | ~$41 | 28% |
| FCF yield target 10% | ~$38-49 | 22-39% |

**Central estimate: $32-36/share (fair value range)**

The DCF is punishing because of the massive net debt. Comparables suggest modest upside. The stock is in a "fairly valued to slightly cheap" zone but does NOT convincingly clear the 25% MoS bar.

## Risk Assessment

### Primary Risks

**1. Broadband Secular Decline (HIGH PROBABILITY, HIGH IMPACT)**
- 10 consecutive quarters of subscriber losses
- 5G FWA and fiber overbuild are structural, not cyclical
- Broadband is the highest-margin product; losses here directly hit EBITDA
- Management acknowledged losses will continue and is deferring price increases in 2026
- **Quantified impact:** Each 1% broadband sub loss = ~$400M revenue hit

**2. Peacock Cash Burn (MEDIUM PROBABILITY, MEDIUM IMPACT)**
- $552M loss in Q4 2025 alone; NBA rights cost $2.5B/year
- Path to profitability unclear; ARPU declining due to wholesale deals
- If Peacock never achieves profitability, it's a permanent value destroyer
- **Quantified impact:** $1-2B annual drag on FCF

**3. Leverage Risk (LOW PROBABILITY, HIGH IMPACT)**
- $99B total debt (D/E 1.02, Debt/EBITDA ~2.7x)
- Manageable at current EBITDA levels, but if EBITDA declines 15-20%, leverage ratios deteriorate quickly
- S&P has affirmed ratings but cable sector outlook is negative

**4. Versant Spin-Off Execution (MEDIUM)**
- Separating cable networks adds complexity
- Could impair Peacock content pipeline if synergies lost
- Market may re-rate remaining Comcast higher or lower depending on execution

**5. Regulatory/Antitrust (LOW)**
- Vertical integration (content + distribution) could face scrutiny
- Net neutrality debates ongoing

### Mitigating Factors
- Massive FCF generation ($14-18B) provides cushion
- Aggressive buyback (5%/year) compresses share count
- Theme parks growing strongly (Epic Universe)
- Wireless adding subscribers as broadband retention tool
- Low beta (0.81) provides portfolio stability

---

## Portfolio Fit Analysis

### Correlation with Existing Holdings
- CMCSA-DTE.DE correlation: **0.118** (very low)
- Excellent diversification benefit; effectively uncorrelated
- Different geographies (US vs Germany), different sub-sectors (cable/media vs mobile telcom)

### Sector/Geography Limits
- Would add US Communication Services exposure (currently none)
- No concentration issues

### Position Sizing (if purchased)
- At 5% weight: ~EUR 250 investment (based on ~EUR 5,000 portfolio)
- Within all limits

## Quality Score Assessment

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| ROE >15% consistent | YES | 21.4% |
| FCF positive 5+ years | YES | $12-18B consistently |
| D/E <1.0 | NO | 1.02, borderline |
| Dividend 10+ years | YES | 19 consecutive increases |
| Wide moat | NO | Narrow, weakening |
| Revenue stability | PARTIAL | Broadband declining |
| Management quality | YES | Aggressive buyback, spin-off strategy |
| Analyst coverage >10 | YES | Heavily covered |
| Market cap >10B | YES | $108B+ |
| Defensive sector | NO | Media/cable is cyclical |

**Quality Score: 6/10 = Tier B confirmed (25% MoS required)**

---

## Autocritique

### Assumptions Made:
1. Base FCF of $14B is conservative (reality may be $15-18B)
2. Broadband losses will stabilize at 2-3% annually (could be worse)
3. Peacock losses will narrow but not reach profitability before 2028
4. Buyback pace continues at ~5%/year
5. No major acquisitions that destroy value

### Biases Detected:
- **Anchoring on low P/E:** The 5.5x headline P/E is misleading (one-time items). Forward 7.5x is the real number.
- **Narrative bias:** "Cord-cutting" narrative may be overdone; broadband is still essential
- **Recency bias:** Recent subscriber losses may moderate as 5G FWA growth slows

### Evidence Potentially Ignored:
- Epic Universe could be a bigger growth driver than modeled (only ~10% of EBITDA currently)
- Wireless segment growing rapidly and could offset broadband losses
- Management's $15B buyback at these prices is highly accretive

### What Would Buffett Do?
Buffett would likely note: (1) the business is in secular decline in its core product, (2) the moat is weakening, (3) but capital allocation (buybacks at low multiples) is excellent. He would probably want a wider margin of safety given the uncertainty.

## Decision

**WATCHLIST at $29.75. Do NOT buy at current price.**

### Rationale:
1. DCF weighted fair value (~$28) suggests stock is approximately fairly valued
2. EV/EBITDA comparables suggest $32-36 fair value range
3. Central estimate ~$32-36 gives only 7-17% MoS, below the 25% Tier B threshold
4. Structural headwinds in broadband create fundamental uncertainty
5. Massive debt load ($89.5B net) reduces equity cushion

### Buy Target:
- **$24-25/share (EUR 20-21)** would provide ~25-30% MoS on $32-36 fair value
- This would require another 17-20% decline from current levels
- At $24, FCF yield would be ~16-21%, buyback yield ~6%, dividend ~5.5%

### Catalysts to Watch:
1. Broadband subscriber trend stabilization (key metric each quarter)
2. Peacock path to profitability (watch NBA rights impact)
3. Epic Universe ramp to full capacity (end of 2026)
4. Buyback pace acceleration at lower prices
5. Versant spin-off completion and market reaction

### Price Alerts:
- **$25.00 USD** - Approach buy zone, initiate deeper refresh
- **$24.00 USD** - Buy zone, 25%+ MoS likely met
- **$35.00 USD** - Remove from watchlist, thesis no longer valid on value basis
