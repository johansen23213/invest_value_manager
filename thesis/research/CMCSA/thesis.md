# CMCSA (Comcast Corporation) - Investment Thesis v3

**Date:** 2026-02-02 (v3 - corrected share count, refined valuation)
**Analyst:** Fundamental Analyst Agent
**Tier:** B (Cyclical Quality - Media/Cable conglomerate)
**Quality Score:** 5.5/10
**Required MoS:** >=25%
**Decision:** WATCHLIST -- Do NOT buy at $29.77. Entry target $25-26.

---

## Executive Summary

Comcast is a structurally complex conglomerate undergoing strategic transformation (Versant spin-off completed Jan 2026). The stock screens as extremely cheap (trailing P/E 5.5x, FCF yield ~16%) but the market is correctly pricing in secular decline of the core broadband business. After deep analysis, the DCF tool output of $60 base fair value is **grossly overstated** due to inflated 2025 FCF (includes $2B one-time tax benefit) and unrealistic growth assumptions on a declining-subscriber business.

**Adjusted fair value: $33-38 (base $35)**
**MoS at $29.77: ~18% -- BELOW the 25% Tier B threshold**
**Entry target: $25.00-$26.25**

The 103% MoS from the DCF tool was a false signal. The market is roughly right here.

## Key Metrics (as of 2026-02-02)

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Price | $29.77 | -16% off 52w high ($35.60) |
| P/E (trailing) | 5.5x | **MISLEADING** - includes one-time items |
| Forward P/E | 7.5x | More representative (fwd EPS ~$4.22) |
| Adj. EPS (FY2025) | $4.31 | Declining YoY |
| GAAP EPS (FY2025) | ~$5.39 | Inflated by non-recurring items |
| Dividend Yield | 4.4% ($1.32/share) | 18 consecutive years of growth |
| FCF (FY2025) | $19.2B reported | **Includes $2B one-time tax benefit** |
| Normalized FCF | ~$14-15B | After stripping one-time items |
| FCF Yield (normalized) | ~13-14% | Strong on $108B market cap |
| D/E | 1.02 | Moderate; total debt ~$97-101B |
| Net Debt/EBITDA | 2.6x | Manageable but elevated; GuruFocus shows 2.64x |
| Market Cap | ~$108B | Corrected: 3.64B shares x $29.77 |
| Shares Outstanding | 3.64B | Down ~5%/yr via buybacks (was 3.83B a year ago) |
| Beta | 0.81 | Below-market volatility |

### Critical Note: Why the Headline P/E Is Misleading
Trailing EPS of ~$5.39 includes one-time items from the Versant spin-off restructuring. Forward EPS consensus is ~$4.22 for 2026 (range $3.45-$4.65). The "5.5x P/E" is an optical illusion. At forward earnings, the stock trades at 7-7.5x -- still cheap but not as extreme as headlines suggest.

---

## 1. Why Is CMCSA So Cheap? (The Market Is Partially Right)

### a) Broadband is in structural decline
- Lost ~710K broadband subscribers in FY2025: Q1 -199K, Q2 -226K, Q3 -104K, Q4 -181K
- On track to lose 700K-1M+ internet customers annually going forward
- FWA competition: Verizon 4.8M FWA subs aiming for 8-9M by 2028; T-Mobile growing aggressively
- Fiber overbuilders expanding into Comcast footprint
- CFO acknowledged "more competitive environment from fiber" in Q4
- ARPU growth (~1.7%) is NOT enough to offset volume decline long-term
- Management deferred price increases in 2026, sacrificing near-term revenue for retention

### b) Cord-cutting is accelerating ("Cord Cutting 2.0")
- Lost 325K TV customers in Q2 2025 alone
- Now it is broadband AND video -- the "last bundle" is unwinding
- Versant spin-off is an acknowledgment that cable networks are terminal

### c) Peacock is a cash furnace with NBA albatross
- Quarterly losses in 2025: Q1 -$215M, Q2 -$101M, Q3 -$217M, Q4 -$552M (total ~$1.1B)
- Q4 loss WORSE than Q4 2024 due to NBA rights costs kicking in
- Full-year 2025: $5.4B revenue, 44M paid subscribers, but still significantly loss-making
- NBA deal: $2.7B/year for 10 years = $27B total commitment
- 44M subscribers is subscale vs Netflix (260M+), Disney+ (150M+)
- Price increase to $10.99/month (most expensive ad-tier in market) risks churn
- Profitability timeline is now "very long way away" per analysts

### d) Record FCF in 2025 is misleading
- $19.2B includes a $2.0B one-time cash tax benefit from Q4 2024 corporate reorganization
- Management explicitly warned "2026 free cash flow will likely be lower"
- Normalized FCF ~$14-15B (still excellent, but not $19B)
- This is why our DCF tool showed 103% MoS -- it used inflated FCF as the base

---

## 2. Why the DCF Tool Output Was Wrong

**Tool output: Bear $48 / Base $60 / Bull $78 vs $29.77 (103% MoS)**

This was a false signal because:

1. **Inflated FCF base**: Tool used reported $19.2B FCF. Normalized is ~$14-15B
2. **Wrong growth assumption**: Default 5% growth on a business losing broadband subscribers is fantasy
3. **Terminal value too high**: 2.5% terminal growth is above GDP for a secularly declining business
4. **NBA costs not in historical base**: $2.7B/year new cost only started Q4 2025
5. **Massive net debt**: ~$95B net debt consumes enormous enterprise value

### Corrected Valuation

#### Method 1: Adjusted DCF

| Scenario | Prob | FCF Base | Growth | WACC | Terminal G | FV/share |
|----------|------|----------|--------|------|-----------|----------|
| Bear | 25% | $13B | 0% | 10% | 1.5% | $23 |
| Base | 50% | $14.5B | 1.5% | 9.5% | 2% | $36 |
| Bull | 25% | $15B | 3% | 9% | 2% | $47 |

Note: Per-share values use 3.64B shares. Net debt ~$95B subtracted.

**Probability-weighted: ~$34/share**

#### Method 2: Sum of Parts

| Segment | EBITDA | Multiple | EV | Rationale |
|---------|--------|----------|-----|-----------|
| Connectivity & Platforms | $22B | 6x | $132B | Cable peers 5.5-6.5x; declining subs limits multiple |
| Theme Parks | $4B | 14x | $56B | DIS parks ~12-15x; Epic Universe growth justifies premium |
| Peacock/Studios/NBC | $1B | 8x | $8B | Loss-making streaming offsets profitable NBC/Studios |
| **Total EV** | | | **$196B** |
| Less: Net Debt | | | **-$95B** |
| **Equity Value** | | | **$101B** |
| **Per Share (3.64B)** | | | **~$28** |

Conservative SoP: ~$28. More generous view (7x connectivity, 16x parks): ~$37-40.

#### Method 3: EV/EBITDA Comparables

| Company | EV/EBITDA | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| CMCSA | 5.1x | Current (EV ~$203B / EBITDA ~$37B) |
| CHTR | 5.7x | Pure-play cable |
| DIS | ~13x | Premium for growth |
| WBD | ~8x | Turnaround |
| Cable sector | 5.5-6.5x | |

At 6.0x EBITDA ($222B EV - $95B debt) / 3.64B shares = ~$35/share
At 6.5x EBITDA ($241B EV - $95B debt) / 3.64B shares = ~$40/share

#### Valuation Summary

| Method | Fair Value | MoS at $29.77 |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Adjusted DCF (weighted) | $34 | 12% |
| Sum of Parts (conservative) | $28 | -6% |
| Sum of Parts (generous) | $37-40 | 20-26% |
| EV/EBITDA 6.0x | $35 | 15% |
| EV/EBITDA 6.5x | $40 | 26% |
| **Central estimate** | **$33-38** | **10-22%** |

**None of these methods consistently clear the 25% MoS threshold at $29.77.**

## 3. Moat Assessment: NARROW (eroding)

**Overall: 5/10**

### Positives
- **Last-mile infrastructure**: Coaxial/fiber to 62M+ homes; expensive to replicate
- **Scale**: Largest US ISP with ~31M broadband subscribers (declining)
- **Business Services**: 56% margins, sticky enterprise contracts, growing mid-single-digits
- **Theme Parks + IP**: Universal brand, Epic Universe proving transformative ($1B+ quarterly EBITDA)
- **Content library**: NBC, Universal Studios, sports rights (NFL, NBA, Olympics)

### Negatives (moat erosion)
- **Broadband moat narrowing**: FWA offers "good enough" at lower prices; fiber overbuilders expanding
- **No pricing power**: Forced to eliminate data caps, offer price locks, bundle mobile for free
- **Streaming has no moat**: Peacock is subscale, content costs escalating
- **Roberts family control (33% voting)**: Limits governance discipline, activist pressure ineffective
- Management acknowledged "most of its footprint will eventually be overbuilt"

---

## 4. Segment Analysis

### Connectivity & Platforms (~63% of revenue) -- DECLINING
- Revenue declining low-single-digits; EBITDA margins ~37% (pressured)
- Broadband: losing ~700K+ subs/year but ARPU partially offsets
- Mobile (Xfinity Mobile, 9.3M lines): bright spot, record 378K adds in Q2, 364K in Q4
- But mobile is MVNO (rides on Verizon network) -- thin margins
- Business Services: stable, growing mid-single-digits, 56% margins
- **Verdict: Cash cow in managed decline. 3-5 year runway before serious compression**

### Content & Experiences (~37% of revenue) -- MIXED
- **Theme Parks (star performer)**: $2.9B revenue Q4 (+22% YoY), EBITDA >$1B/quarter for first time
  - Epic Universe driving longer stays, higher per-cap spending
  - Less cannibalization of existing parks than expected
  - Universal Kids Resort (Frisco, TX) coming 2026
  - Full capacity at Epic Universe expected late 2026
  - Potential for $5B+ annual EBITDA at maturity
- **Peacock (problem child)**: $5.4B revenue FY2025, ~$1.1B EBITDA losses; NBA deal makes profitability distant
- **Studios**: Volatile, hit-driven; revenue down 7% in Q4
- **NBC Broadcast**: Stable, not growing

### Versant (spun off Jan 2, 2026)
- Cable networks: USA, CNBC, MSNBC, SYFY, E!, etc.
- 1 VSNT share per 25 CMCSA shares (~145.8M VSNT shares outstanding)
- Market cap ~$6.5B; trading at ~$40.57 at debut (fell 13% day 1)
- Smart strategic move -- removes lowest-growth assets, lets RemainCo focus on broadband/parks/streaming

## 5. Financial Health & FCF Sustainability

| Metric | FY2025 | Assessment |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Revenue | ~$125B | Flat to +1% |
| Adj. EBITDA | $37.4B | Declining (NBA costs hit starting Q4) |
| FCF (reported) | $19.2B | Record, but inflated by ~$2B one-time |
| FCF (normalized) | ~$14-15B | After one-time items |
| Total Debt | ~$97-101B | Per GuruFocus/MacroAxis |
| Net Debt | ~$95B | Cash ~$5B |
| Net Debt/EBITDA | 2.6x | Within 2.1-3.8x historical range |
| Dividend cost | ~$4.8B/yr | 3.64B shares x $1.32 |
| Buybacks | ~$7B in 2025 | Aggressive at low prices |
| Total shareholder return | ~$12B in 2025 | |

### Debt Assessment: Elevated but Manageable
- Total debt ~$97-101B is among the highest of any US company
- Net debt/EBITDA of 2.6x is within normal range for cable (CHTR runs 4x+)
- Interest expense ~$4.5B/year; well-covered by EBITDA
- No near-term maturity wall (Comcast has well-laddered debt)
- Risk: if EBITDA declines 20%, leverage jumps to 3.2x -- still manageable but uncomfortable
- Rating: BBB+ / Baa1 -- investment grade, no downgrade imminent

### FCF Trajectory Concern
- 2025 normalized: ~$14-15B
- 2026 est.: $12-14B (management guided lower; NBA full-year cost, broadband decline)
- 2027-2028 est.: $11-13B (if broadband erosion continues)
- Even declining FCF at $12B = ~11% FCF yield on $108B market cap -- still attractive

### Dividend Safety
- Payout ratio: ~32-34% of normalized FCF (using $4.8B / $14-15B)
- Even at $12B FCF: payout ratio ~40%
- **Dividend is SAFE** with substantial headroom
- 18 years of consecutive increases; management committed to 19th year

## 6. Quality Score

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| ROE >15% consistent | 0.5/1 | ~15-21%, volatile |
| FCF positive 5+ years | 1/1 | Consistently $12-19B |
| D/E <1.0 | 0/1 | 1.02, borderline fail |
| Dividend 10+ years | 1/1 | 18 consecutive increases |
| Wide moat | 0/1 | Narrow, eroding |
| Revenue stability | 0.5/1 | Broadband declining structurally |
| Management quality | 0.5/1 | Good operators, Roberts control is governance risk |
| Analyst coverage >10 | 1/1 | 22+ analysts |
| Market cap >10B EUR | 1/1 | ~EUR 91B |
| Defensive sector | 0/1 | Media/cable facing disruption |

**Quality Score: 5.5/10 = Tier B (25% MoS required)**

Entry price for 25% MoS: $35 x 0.75 = **$26.25** (on base fair value)
Entry price for 25% MoS: $33 x 0.75 = **$24.75** (on conservative fair value)

## 7. Analyst Consensus (Reality Check)

| Source | Target | Upside from $29.77 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| WallStreetZen (15 analysts) | $35.70 | +20% |
| MarketBeat (consensus) | $36.47 | +22% |
| Morningstar (5 stars) | $49.00 | +65% |
| High target (Benchmark) | $55.65 | +87% |
| Low target | $28.00-$28.28 | -5% to -6% |

Analyst consensus is $35-37, broadly consistent with my $33-38 range. Morningstar's $49 looks too generous (assumes broadband stabilization that may not materialize). The low targets ($28) suggest some analysts see the stock as slightly overvalued here.

---

## 8. Key Risks & Kill Conditions

### Critical Risks
1. **Broadband subscriber losses accelerate beyond 300K/quarter** -- if FWA/fiber gain share faster, the cash cow collapses
2. **Peacock never reaches profitability** -- $2.7B/year NBA deal could be a $27B mistake
3. **Leverage creep** -- 2.6x net debt/EBITDA; if EBITDA declines 15-20%, leverage hits 3.2x+
4. **Roberts family value-destructive M&A** -- history of empire-building (Sky acquisition was questionable)

### Moderate Risks
5. Theme park execution / Epic Universe cannibalization (early data says limited)
6. Starlink as broadband alternative (currently niche but growing)
7. Regulatory risk (net neutrality, content regulation)
8. Interest rate environment pressuring highly-leveraged companies

### Kill Conditions (remove from watchlist)
- Broadband losses exceed 300K/quarter for 3+ consecutive quarters
- Peacock annual losses widen beyond $2B
- Dividend cut or freeze
- Net leverage exceeds 3.5x
- Normalized FCF drops below $10B annualized

---

## 9. Catalysts

### Positive
- Epic Universe full capacity (late 2026): could push parks to $5B+ EBITDA
- Buybacks at ~5%/year are highly accretive at these multiples (buying back at 7x fwd earnings)
- Versant spin-off: RemainCo potentially re-rated higher (cleaner story)
- Mobile growth (9.3M lines, growing 350K+/quarter) -- path to 15M+ lines
- Peacock profitability (optimistic: 2027-2028)
- Universal Kids Resort (Frisco, TX) 2026

### Negative
- FWA subscriber growth continues accelerating (Verizon targeting 8-9M)
- NBA costs fully hit P&L in 2026 ($2.7B annual)
- Management guided 2026 FCF lower than 2025
- Broadband price competition intensifying

---

## 10. Decision

### RECOMMENDATION: HOLD ON WATCHLIST -- DO NOT BUY AT $29.77

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Thesis complete | YES |
| MoS >= 25% | **NO** (only ~12-22% depending on method; central ~15%) |
| Moat identified | Narrow, eroding |
| Risks documented | YES |
| Position limits OK | YES (would be first US media holding) |

### What Would Change My Mind
- **Price drops to $25-26**: Achieves 25%+ MoS on $33-35 FV
- **Broadband losses stabilize**: 3 consecutive quarters of improvement
- **Peacock breakeven**: Excluding NBA, showing path to profitability
- **Theme parks exceed expectations**: $5B+ EBITDA supports higher SoP valuation

### Watchlist Parameters
- **Tier:** 2 (monitoring)
- **Entry price:** $25.00-$26.25 (25% MoS on $33-35 FV range)
- **Fair Value range:** $33-38 (base $35)
- **Stop/Kill:** Below $20 reassess entire thesis; remove if kill conditions triggered

### Price Alerts
- **$26.00** -- Approach buy zone, refresh thesis
- **$25.00** -- Buy zone, 25%+ MoS met
- **$36.00** -- Fair value reached, remove from watchlist

---

## 11. Autocritique

### Assumptions
1. Normalized FCF of $14-15B (stripping one-time tax benefit) -- could be conservative or generous
2. Broadband losses continue at ~700K/year pace (not accelerating) -- key risk
3. Theme parks maintain 20%+ growth through 2026 via Epic Universe
4. NBA costs fully absorbed without offsetting Peacock revenue growth
5. No major value-destructive acquisitions by Roberts family
6. Net debt ~$95B (confirmed via multiple sources)

### Biases Detected
- **Anchoring to DCF output**: Had to actively fight the "103% MoS" framing -- the tool gave a false positive
- **Possible excessive pessimism on broadband**: Comcast still has best speeds in most markets; DOCSIS 4.0 could extend competitive advantage
- **Narrative bias**: "Cord cutting" is a powerful narrative that may overshoot reality

### Evidence Ignored
- Mobile segment growing fast and could become meaningful contributor (9.3M and accelerating)
- DOCSIS 4.0 rollout could restore broadband speed advantage vs FWA/fiber
- Theme parks could independently be worth $50B+ within 2-3 years

### What I Could Be Wrong About
- **Bull case I may be underweighting**: If mobile bundling + DOCSIS 4.0 stabilize broadband, AND theme parks hit $5B EBITDA, AND Peacock reaches breakeven, fair value could be $42-50
- **Bear case I may be underweighting**: If FWA/fiber triggers price war AND leverage increases AND Peacock losses persist, fair value could be $20-25

### What Would a Top Investor Think?
A Buffett/Klarman type would note: (1) the moat is weakening -- this is not a business getting stronger over time, (2) ~$95B of debt is a lot for a business with declining core revenues, (3) but capital allocation (buybacks at 7x fwd earnings) is genuinely intelligent, (4) theme parks are an underappreciated asset that could be worth $50B+ standalone. They would likely want $24-26 entry to have genuine margin of safety.
