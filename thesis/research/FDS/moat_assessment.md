# Moat Assessment: FDS (FactSet Research Systems)

## Date: 2026-02-13

## Classification: NARROW

---

## Executive Summary

FactSet possesses a NARROW moat built primarily on **switching costs** embedded in buy-side workflows, with a secondary contribution from **intangible assets** (proprietary analytics layer, brand in buy-side community). However, the moat is under active pressure from three directions: (1) AI-native competitors eroding the value of data aggregation, (2) growth deceleration from ~11% historical to 5% guided, and (3) declining mindshare (23.0% to 21.8% YoY). The switching costs are real but narrower than often claimed -- FactSet is NOT the Bloomberg of buy-side (Bloomberg IS the Bloomberg of buy-side, with 35% mindshare vs FDS 22%). The classification of NARROW rather than WIDE reflects that only ONE moat source (switching costs) is strong and durable, while the second source (intangible assets) faces active erosion from AI disruption.

## Fuentes de Moat Identificadas

| Source | Present | Evidence | Durability | Trajectory |
|--------|---------|----------|------------|------------|
| Cost advantage | NO | FDS is the "cheaper Bloomberg" but being cheaper is not a moat -- it is a competitive response. GM 53% vs MSCI 82%, SPGI 70%. FactSet has scale but not cost leadership in data production. | N/A | N/A |
| Network effects | WEAK/NO | Limited. Some data marketplace effects (Open:FactSet), but financial data terminals do not exhibit classic network effects. A competitor launching an identical terminal would compete on data/analytics quality, not user base. | N/A | N/A |
| Intangible assets | YES (MODERATE) | Brand dominance in buy-side portfolio analytics (PA/SPAR are industry standard tools). Proprietary analytics layer on top of aggregated data. No patents. No regulatory licenses. The value is in the analytical framework, not the underlying data. | 10-15 years | Declining (AI threatens analytics layer) |
| Switching costs | YES (STRONG) | 95%+ ASV retention rate. 91% client retention. 3-6 month migration for enterprise clients. Deep integration into portfolio management workflows. Custom reporting templates, historical data configurations, API integrations. Average contract ~multi-year. Buy-side firms build entire investment processes around PA/SPAR. | 15-20 years | Stable but facing pressure |
| Efficient scale | NO | Financial data market is large ($20B+) with room for multiple competitors. Bloomberg, SPGI, MSCI, LSEG all thrive. Not a natural monopoly/oligopoly dynamic. | N/A | N/A |

## Detailed Source Analysis

### 1. Switching Costs (PRIMARY MOAT -- Strong)

**Evidence:**
- **ASV retention >95%** (dollar-weighted): Clients renew ~$2.3B of $2.4B ASV annually. This is the strongest quantitative evidence of stickiness.
- **Client retention 91%**: Lower than ASV retention, indicating smaller/lower-value clients churn more. The HIGH-value enterprise buy-side clients are extremely sticky.
- **Migration cost**: 3-6 months for full team transition. For a 50-person asset manager, this means:
  - Rewriting all custom PA reports and templates
  - Retraining analysts on new interface (learning curve)
  - Migrating historical data configurations
  - Rebuilding API integrations with internal systems
  - Reconnecting OMS/EMS workflows (especially post-LiquidityBook integration)
  - Estimated direct cost: $200K-$500K+ for enterprise client (licenses + lost productivity)
- **Workflow embedding**: FactSet PA/SPAR are deeply embedded in buy-side performance attribution, risk reporting, and compliance workflows. Portfolio managers who built their career on FactSet PA resist change.
- **LiquidityBook acquisition** (Feb 2025, $246.5M): Extends switching costs deeper into OMS/trade execution. Now FactSet covers research -> analytics -> portfolio construction -> order management -> execution. Each additional workflow touchpoint increases lock-in.

**Durability: 15-20 years.** Enterprise workflow switching costs are among the most durable in software. However, they are NOT infinite -- a generational shift (new PMs who grew up on different tools) could erode them over 15-20 years.

**Limitations:**
- Switching costs protect the INSTALLED BASE, not growth. New clients evaluate all options.
- Bloomberg's switching costs are even higher (messaging network + trading + terminal culture).
- The 91% client retention (vs 95% ASV) means FactSet DOES lose clients at the margin -- smaller firms and new entrants are more price-sensitive.

### 2. Intangible Assets (SECONDARY MOAT -- Moderate)

**Evidence:**
- **Brand in buy-side community**: FactSet is the #2 mindshare platform (21.8%) behind Bloomberg (35.3%). It is the default "second terminal" at many asset managers.
- **Portfolio Analytics (PA/SPAR)**: These are best-in-class tools for performance attribution and risk analysis on the buy-side. Won Risk.net awards repeatedly. This is where FactSet's true differentiation lies -- not in raw data, but in HOW the data is presented and analyzed.
- **Proprietary analytics layer**: While underlying data is largely aggregated from third parties (200+ databases, 50+ data suppliers), FactSet's value-add is the integration, normalization, and analytical framework layered on top. This is intellectual capital, not patented IP.

**Critical vulnerability -- Axioma is NOT a FactSet product:**
The initial prompt mentioned Axioma risk models as potential FactSet IP. This is INCORRECT. Axioma is owned by SimCorp (Deutsche Boerse subsidiary) since 2023. FactSet previously had a partnership to distribute Axioma risk models, but Axioma is now a COMPETITOR under Deutsche Boerse/SimCorp's integrated investment management platform. This is a NEGATIVE for FactSet's moat -- they lost access to differentiated risk analytics and must compete with their former partner.

**Durability: 10-15 years.** Brand loyalty in financial services is durable but not permanent. The analytics layer is vulnerable to AI -- if ChatGPT/Gemini/AlphaSense can produce comparable portfolio analytics at a fraction of the cost, FactSet's analytical value-add erodes.

### 3. Cost Advantage -- NOT PRESENT

**Why being "cheaper than Bloomberg" is not a moat:**
- FactSet pricing: ~$12K-$50K/user/year
- Bloomberg: ~$32K/user/year
- Being cheaper is a COMPETITIVE RESPONSE, not a cost advantage. FactSet does not have lower production costs -- it simply charges less because it has less data coverage and less trading functionality than Bloomberg.
- Gross margin 53% is BELOW peers (MSCI 82%, SPGI 70%), indicating FactSet does NOT have superior cost economics.

### 4. Network Effects -- NOT MEANINGFULLY PRESENT

Financial data terminals are NOT network-effect businesses. Bloomberg's chat/messaging network is the closest thing to a network effect in the industry, and FactSet does not have an equivalent. Open:FactSet marketplace is nascent and does not drive material switching cost or value accretion.

### 5. Efficient Scale -- NOT PRESENT

The financial data market is large and growing, with room for Bloomberg ($10B+ revenue), SPGI ($15B+), MSCI ($2.7B), LSEG ($8B+), and FactSet ($2.3B) to all operate profitably. There are no natural limits preventing entry or expansion.

## Evidencia Cuantitativa

| Metric | FDS | Peer Median | Difference | Notes |
|--------|-----|-------------|------------|-------|
| ROIC (4yr avg) | 17.4% | ~20-25% (MSCI 37.7%) | -3 to -8pp | FDS underperforms MSCI significantly; comparable to SPGI post-Markit merger |
| ROIC-WACC spread | +11.1pp | +10-30pp (MSCI +30.5pp) | Positive but modest vs best peers | Demonstrates value creation but not exceptional |
| Gross Margin | 52.7% | ~70-82% (MSCI 82%, SPGI 70%) | -17 to -29pp BELOW peers | CRITICAL: FDS GM is significantly below data/analytics peers. Indicates higher content costs (data aggregation from 200+ suppliers) |
| Operating Margin | 32.2% | ~40-55% (MSCI 55%, SPGI 40%) | -8 to -23pp below | Reflects cost structure disadvantage |
| FCF Margin | 26.6% | ~35-47% (MSCI 47%, SPGI 36%) | -9 to -20pp below | Cash generation below peers |
| Revenue CAGR (4yr) | 8.0% | ~10-12% (SPGI 11%, MSCI ~11%) | -2 to -4pp below | Growth decelerating to 5% guided FY26 |
| ASV Retention | >95% | N/A (Bloomberg ~95%+) | High absolute, comparable to Bloomberg | Strongest moat evidence |
| Client Retention | 91% | N/A | Good but imperfect | ~9% annual client churn = ~800 clients/year lost |
| ROIC Persistence (4yr available) | 4/4 > WACC | - | Consistent | Limited history in tool but Gurufocus shows 10yr avg 25.1% |

### Peer Margin Comparison (FDS vs Financial Data Peers)

| Company | Gross Margin | Op Margin | FCF Margin | ROIC |
|---------|-------------|-----------|------------|------|
| **MSCI** | 82% | 55% | 47% | 41% |
| **SPGI** | 70% | 40% | 36% | 10% (depressed by Markit goodwill) |
| **VRSK** | ~73% | ~40% | ~35% | ~25%+ |
| **FDS** | 53% | 32% | 27% | 19% |

**Interpretation:** FactSet's margins are SUBSTANTIALLY below the best financial data/analytics peers. This is NOT a margin premium story. FactSet's lower margins reflect its cost structure as primarily a DATA AGGREGATOR -- it pays significant content costs to 200+ third-party data suppliers. MSCI and VRSK create proprietary data/indices/ratings that command much higher margins. This margin differential is a structural issue, not a temporary one.

## Amenazas al Moat

| Threat | Probability | Impact | Horizon | Detail |
|--------|-------------|--------|---------|--------|
| AI-native disruption (AlphaSense, Koyfin, ChatGPT) | MEDIUM-HIGH | HIGH | 3-7 years | AI tools can replicate FactSet's data aggregation + analytics layer at lower cost. AlphaSense (CNBC Disruptor 50, #8 in 2025) offers AI-powered financial research. Anthropic's announcement caused FDS selloff. Core risk: the ANALYTICS LAYER (FactSet's main value-add) is exactly what AI is good at. |
| Bloomberg vertical integration | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | 5-10 years | Bloomberg expanding buy-side analytics while maintaining messaging/trading moat. Bloomberg can subsidize analytics with terminal revenue (~$10B). |
| SPGI Capital IQ Pro expansion | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | 3-5 years | Post-Markit merger, S&P has unmatched proprietary data (ratings, indices, benchmarks). Capital IQ Pro is improving rapidly. SPGI has resources to invest heavily. |
| Buy-side headcount reduction (AI) | HIGH | HIGH | 2-5 years | If AI reduces analyst headcount at asset managers (fewer seats needed), FactSet's per-seat model is directly impacted. This is the same SaaSpocalypse risk we track for ADBE/INTU. Seeking Alpha notes "tepid employee growth, especially among graduate and new analyst hires, directly impacting FactSet's growth potential." |
| SimCorp/Axioma competitive threat | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | 3-5 years | Former partner now competitor. SimCorp's integrated platform (OMS + analytics + risk under Deutsche Boerse) directly competes with FactSet's expanding front-to-back strategy. |
| Growth deceleration becoming structural | MEDIUM-HIGH | HIGH | 1-3 years | Organic ASV growth decelerated from ~11% LT average to 5.7% (FY2025) and 4-6% guided (FY2026). If this is structural, not cyclical, FDS deserves lower multiple permanently. 0 of 19 analysts rate BUY. |

## Escenarios de Erosion

### Scenario 1: Gradual AI Erosion (Most Probable, 40% probability)

Over 3-7 years, AI tools (both from competitors like AlphaSense/Bloomberg and generic tools like ChatGPT/Gemini with financial plugins) increasingly replicate FactSet's analytics capabilities at lower cost points. New/small asset managers adopt AI-native tools instead of FactSet. Existing enterprise clients maintain subscriptions due to switching costs but negotiate harder on pricing. FactSet growth stalls at 2-4% (from current 5%), margins compress 200-300bp, and the stock re-rates to a lower multiple. Moat does not disappear but NARROWS further.

**Timeline:** 2026-2032
**Impact:** FV reduction of 20-30%

### Scenario 2: Buy-Side Headcount Collapse (Tail Risk, 15% probability)

AI dramatically reduces analyst/PM headcount at asset managers within 3-5 years. FactSet's per-seat model is devastated. ASV declines as firms cancel seats. Even 95% dollar retention means nothing if the base shrinks. FactSet must pivot to enterprise-wide licensing (like Bloomberg) rather than per-seat, compressing revenue per client.

**Timeline:** 2027-2030
**Impact:** FV reduction of 40-50%, moat downgraded to NONE

### Scenario 3: Status Quo / Mild Improvement (30% probability)

AI disruption is slower than feared. FactSet successfully integrates AI into its own products (they are investing in this). LiquidityBook deepens lock-in. Buy-side hiring stabilizes. FactSet maintains 5-7% growth, margins stable. Moat remains NARROW.

**Timeline:** 2026-2030
**Impact:** Current FV range intact

## Discrepancies with Thesis (if applicable)

No existing FDS thesis exists yet (this is R1). However, I note the following for the analyst who will write the thesis:

1. **Do NOT classify FDS as Wide moat.** Despite 95% ASV retention, the single-source switching cost moat, below-peer margins, and active AI disruption threat make this clearly NARROW, not WIDE. Compare with VRSK (which we classified as needing R2) -- VRSK has proprietary data creation (Wide moat candidate), while FDS aggregates third-party data (Narrow moat).

2. **The "data aggregator" vulnerability is real.** FactSet's core business is aggregating data from 200+ suppliers and presenting it with an analytics layer. The data itself is NOT proprietary -- if a client can access the same underlying data through Bloomberg, SPGI, or AI tools, FactSet's value-add is only the analytics layer. And that is exactly what AI threatens.

3. **Growth deceleration is the critical signal.** From 11% LT average to 5% guided. This is not just a cyclical slowdown -- it reflects structural headwinds (AI disruption fears, buy-side headcount pressure, competition). Monitor ASV growth as the key health metric.

4. **The Axioma confusion must be avoided.** FactSet does NOT own Axioma risk models. Axioma is SimCorp/Deutsche Boerse. FactSet HAD a partnership to distribute Axioma but SimCorp is now a competitor with its own integrated platform.

5. **The margin gap matters.** FDS at 53% GM vs MSCI at 82% or VRSK at ~73% tells you that FDS has a fundamentally different (and worse) business model. Data aggregation has structurally lower margins than proprietary data/index creation. This limits FDS's ability to invest in AI defense.

## Moat Rating Summary

| Dimension | Assessment |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Classification** | **NARROW** |
| **Primary source** | Switching costs (buy-side workflow embedding, 95% ASV retention) |
| **Secondary source** | Intangible assets (PA/SPAR brand, analytics layer) -- but under pressure |
| **Strength** | 3/5 -- Real but single-dimensional and facing active threats |
| **Durability** | 10-15 years (switching costs are durable; analytics moat is eroding) |
| **Direction** | WEAKENING -- Growth deceleration, AI disruption, mindshare declining |
| **ROIC sustainability** | ROIC >WACC is likely to persist (18.7% vs 7.6% WACC) but may compress toward 12-15% as competition intensifies and pricing power weakens |

## 🔄 META-REFLECTION

### Doubts/Uncertainties
- **Axioma relationship status**: I could not find the exact current status of FactSet's partnership with Axioma/SimCorp. It is possible FactSet still distributes some Axioma models under license even though SimCorp is now a competitor. This needs clarification from 10-K filings.
- **AI investment effectiveness**: FactSet claims to be investing heavily in AI (Mercury platform, FactSet AI). I could not assess how effective these investments are vs competitors. This is a major uncertainty -- if FactSet successfully AI-augments its analytics, the moat could strengthen rather than erode.
- **Client granularity**: The 91% client retention (vs 95% ASV) suggests smaller clients churn more. I could not determine whether the churn is concentrated in specific segments (wealth? corporate? small buy-side?) which would help assess moat durability in core markets.
- **Margin comparison impurity**: SPGI's ROIC appears low (9.7%) due to massive goodwill from IHS Markit acquisition. Pre-merger SPGI ROIC was much higher. Direct ROIC comparison vs SPGI is misleading without adjusting for goodwill.

### Suggestions for System
- **Create a "data moat taxonomy"**: Distinguish between proprietary data creators (MSCI, VRSK, Moody's) vs data aggregators (FDS, LSEG/Refinitiv) vs platform businesses (Bloomberg). These have fundamentally different moat profiles.
- **Add SaaSpocalypse/per-seat risk to moat assessment template**: The AI threat to per-seat software pricing is a systematic risk factor that should be evaluated for ALL software/data companies in the universe.
- **Track ASV retention as ongoing moat health metric**: For subscription businesses like FDS, annual retention is the single best quantitative moat indicator. Add to monitoring framework.

### Anomalies Detected
- **FDS stock price**: Down 57% from 52-week high ($474.79 to $203.74). This is an extreme move for a company with 95% ASV retention and positive ROIC. The market is pricing in a fundamental thesis change (AI disruption). Either the market is right (and the moat is eroding faster than I assess) or it is overreacting (and $204 is a significant opportunity). This is the key tension for the fundamental analyst to resolve.
- **P/E compression**: P/E at 13.0x is historically low for FDS (which typically traded at 25-35x). This low multiple implies the market expects growth to be permanently impaired.
- **0 of 19 analysts rate BUY**: This is unusual for a quality business and may represent peak pessimism or genuine structural concern.

### Questions for Orchestrator
1. How does FDS's moat profile compare with VRSK (also in our R3 pipeline)? VRSK has proprietary data creation while FDS aggregates -- should this difference drive meaningfully different moat classifications?
2. Should we add "AI disruption of analytics layer" as a systematic risk factor for all data/analytics companies in the quality universe (FDS, VRSK, MSCI, SPGI, MORN)?
3. Given the 57% price decline and P/E of 13x, should we fast-track FDS to full R1 thesis despite the NARROW moat classification? The price decline may be creating opportunity even with a weaker moat than pure data creators.
