# Counter-Analysis: FDS (FactSet Research Systems)

## Fecha: 2026-02-13

> **CRITICAL FINDING:** The thesis lists "KC#6: CEO Departure" as a kill condition, stating Philip Snow (CEO since 2015) is essential. **Snow ALREADY RETIRED in September 2025.** He was replaced by Sanoke Viswanathan (ex-JPMorgan). The thesis completely omits this CEO transition, which occurred 5 months ago. This is a factual error that invalidates a kill condition and raises questions about the analyst's data currency.

## Resumen Ejecutivo

The FDS thesis presents a coherent case for a high-quality, temporarily depressed subscription data business. However, the counter-analysis reveals **3 HIGH and 2 MODERATE** challenges that weaken the thesis materially. The most damaging findings are: (1) a CEO transition the thesis entirely missed, (2) revenue-per-user structural decline already in progress with no evidence of reversal, (3) correlated AI/competition/headcount risks that could all trigger simultaneously, and (4) consensus analyst sentiment at "Reduce" with 0-1 Buy ratings out of 19, suggesting the market sees something the thesis may be underweighting. The FV of $225 survives partial scrutiny but should be revised to **$200-210** after incorporating the correlated risk discount and unit economics deterioration. The entry price of $180 is adequate but not generous given the risk profile.

## Asunciones Clave Desafiadas

### 1. CEO Kill Condition Already Triggered (Factual Error)

- **Asuncion in thesis:** "KC#6: CEO Departure -- Philip Snow (CEO since 2015, 30 years at FDS, 88% Glassdoor approval) departs. The company's strategic pivot rests heavily on his leadership."
- **Evidencia en contra:** Philip Snow retired as CEO effective September 8, 2025. He was replaced by Sanoke Viswanathan, previously CEO of International Consumer and Wealth at JPMorgan Chase. Snow served as senior advisor through December 2025 and is now fully departed. This was announced June 3, 2025, well before the thesis was written. [Source: FactSet press release June 2025, multiple news outlets]
- **Severidad:** **CRITICAL**
- **Resolucion sugerida:** The thesis must be updated to reflect the new CEO. The kill condition KC#6 has technically been triggered by its own definition. The investment committee must evaluate: (a) Is Viswanathan a credible replacement? His JPMorgan pedigree is strong but he is an outsider with zero FactSet experience. (b) CEO transitions during investment phases (cloud migration + AI pivot) carry elevated execution risk. (c) The FY2026 margin compression guidance was set under Viswanathan's leadership, not Snow's. (d) Viswanathan's JPMorgan background suggests potential for more aggressive M&A strategy -- which could be positive (growth) or negative (balance sheet risk). This is NOT automatically a thesis-killer, but the thesis cannot proceed with a dead kill condition referencing a CEO who left 5 months ago.

### 2. Revenue-Per-User Structural Decline (Unit Economics Deterioration)

- **Asuncion in thesis:** "Wealth expansion at lower price points dilutes average but grows total ASV... Pricing +2-3% annual."
- **Evidencia en contra:** User count grew 9.7% (to 239,863) while organic ASV grew only 5.9%. This means revenue per user declined approximately 3.5% YoY. Net client addition was only 7 firms in Q1 FY2026. The thesis acknowledges this but treats it as a feature ("growing total ASV") rather than a bug. Seeking Alpha analysis specifically highlights "Revenue per user has declined, offsetting topline gains." Furthermore, lower CPI reduces the CPI-linked price escalators that drive pricing power. If wealth management users at $4K-8K/year replace institutional users at $12K-50K/year in the mix, the ARPU decline is structural, not temporary.
- **Severidad:** **HIGH**
- **Resolucion sugerida:** The thesis growth assumption of 6% is predicated on pricing +2-3%. If ARPU declines 2-3% annually from mix shift, then organic ASV growth converges to volume growth only (3-4%), which is the bear case. The investment committee should demand evidence that institutional ARPU is holding or rising before accepting the 6% growth assumption. Monitor Q2 FY2026 earnings closely for revenue-per-user trend.

### 3. SBC is $61M, But $152M in MacroTrends TTM -- Data Reconciliation Needed

- **Asuncion in thesis:** "SBC: $61M in FY2025 (2.6% of revenue) -- MODEST vs peers"
- **Evidencia en contra:** The $61.2M figure from the 10-K cash flow statement is confirmed correct as the stock-based compensation expense recognized in FY2025. However, MacroTrends shows $152M for the twelve months ending August 2025, which may include different SBC-related items (e.g., amortization of acquisition-related equity awards, RSU vesting settlements). The discrepancy warrants investigation. If the true economic cost of equity compensation is $152M (6.5% of revenue), not $61M (2.6%), then: SBC-adjusted FCF = $617M - $152M = $465M (not $556M), and the SBC-adjusted FCF yield drops from 7.3% to 6.1%. This would reduce the DCF FV by approximately 15%, from $244 to ~$207.
- **Severidad:** **MODERATE** -- the 10-K figure appears correct at $61M, but the MacroTrends discrepancy needs resolution before committing capital.
- **Resolucion sugerida:** Pull the actual 10-K filing and verify: (a) What does the $152M figure include? (b) Are there acquisition-related equity awards from CUSIP, LiquidityBook, etc. flowing through other line items? (c) What is the total dilution rate (shares issued via SBC / diluted shares)? Until resolved, use $61M as the conservative assumption but flag the uncertainty.

### 4. Correlated Risk Cluster: AI + Competition + Headcount (Triple Threat)

- **Asuncion in thesis:** "AI could reduce seat count at clients. Net effect uncertain. FactSet's Mercury AI is early monetization proof."
- **Evidencia en contra:** The three HIGH risks from the risk assessment are deeply correlated:
  - **AI disruption** reduces the value of FactSet's analytics layer (its main value-add over raw data)
  - **Bloomberg/SPGI competitive squeeze** is amplified by AI because they spend 10x on technology
  - **Buy-side headcount reduction** directly hits the per-seat pricing model

  These are NOT independent risks. If AI progresses as expected, ALL THREE materialize simultaneously. The thesis treats them as separate concerns with separate probability estimates. In reality, the joint probability that at least two of three materialize is higher than any individual probability.

  Evidence: Goldman Sachs (SELL rating) explicitly cites "AI disintermediation, limited pricing power, and elevated investment requirements" as LINKED threats. Wells Fargo (Underweight) cut the target citing AI competition specifically. 0-1 out of 19 analysts rate BUY -- this is extraordinary for a company with 95% retention and 19% ROIC. The market is pricing in correlated risk.

  The buy-side headcount threat is real but slower than feared. Fortune reports "AI-related layoffs have been insignificant so far" in finance, with firms "reducing hiring rather than conducting mass layoffs." TechCrunch notes investors predict "AI is coming for labor in 2026" but actual displacement remains limited. However, this is a gradual erosion, not a cliff -- and gradual erosion of seat count at 2-3%/year would be devastating to FactSet's per-seat model over a 5-year horizon.

- **Severidad:** **HIGH**
- **Resolucion sugerida:** Apply a "correlated risk discount" of 5-10% to the FV to account for the probability that multiple risks materialize together. At a 7.5% discount: FV drops from $225 to ~$208. This is consistent with the risk-identifier's recommendation of $160-170 entry.

### 5. Market Consensus Dramatically Bearish: 0-1 Buy Ratings Out of 19

- **Asuncion in thesis:** "57% decline for a business growing 5-6% organically with 95%+ retention is excessive multiple compression"
- **Evidencia en contra:** The analyst community has reached near-unanimous negative consensus:
  - Goldman Sachs: SELL (reiterated Feb 2026)
  - Wells Fargo: Underweight, PT cut from $265 to $215
  - Stifel: Hold, PT cut from $372 to $295
  - Evercore ISI: In Line, disappointed in lack of strategic clarity
  - Consensus rating: "Reduce" per MarketBeat
  - 10% Strong Buy, 0% Buy, 60% Hold, 20% Sell, 10% Strong Sell

  When 19 professional analysts who follow a company daily ALL refuse to recommend buying at P/E 13x, and most are actively cutting targets, the Bayesian prior should be that they see something real. The thesis dismisses this as "excessive" -- but the contrarian has the burden of proof.

  The thesis's counter-argument (95% retention, 19% ROIC, 27% FCF) is valid for an established business, but the market is pricing the TRAJECTORY, not the current state. Retention is a lagging indicator -- it drops AFTER alternatives emerge, not before.

- **Severidad:** **MODERATE**
- **Resolucion sugerida:** The investment committee should explicitly address: "19 analysts cover FDS daily and none recommend buying. What do we see that they do not?" The answer must be specific and evidence-based, not generic ("the market overreacts"). If the answer is only "longer time horizon," that is a valid but weak edge.

## Desafios por Categoria

### Negocio

| # | Desafio | Evidencia | Severidad |
|---|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | CEO transition missed entirely in thesis | Snow retired Sep 2025, replaced by Viswanathan (ex-JPMorgan). KC#6 technically triggered. | CRITICAL |
| 2 | Revenue per user declining 3.5% YoY | Users +9.7%, ASV +5.9%. Net client adds = 7. Wealth users at lower ARPU diluting mix. | HIGH |
| 3 | FactSet is a data AGGREGATOR, not data CREATOR | GM 53% vs MSCI 82%, VRSK 73%. Lower margins = less capacity to invest in AI defense. Structural, not fixable. | HIGH |
| 4 | Axioma is now a competitor, not a partner | SimCorp/Deutsche Boerse owns Axioma. Integrated platform competes with FDS front-to-back strategy. | MODERATE |
| 5 | Net client additions of only 7 in Q1 FY2026 | Growth is from more users at existing clients, not new logos. Raises client concentration risk. | MODERATE |
| 6 | EMEA "secular headwinds" acknowledged by CFO | Helen Shan noted midsized asset managers and owners face headwinds. EMEA = 25% of ASV. | LOW |

### Valoracion

| # | Desafio | Evidencia | Severidad |
|---|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 7 | $225 FV relies on 6% growth that may converge to 4% | If ARPU declines 2-3%/yr from mix shift, volume growth alone = 3-4%. Goldman Sachs agrees: mid-single-digit ceiling. | HIGH |
| 8 | DCF sensitivity extreme (87% FV spread, 75% TV) | At WACC 10.5% / Growth 3%, FV = $166 (19% below current price). Small input changes = large FV swings. | MODERATE |
| 9 | EV/EBIT 15x multiple may be generous | Thesis derives 15x from MORN comparison + adjustments. But MORN has proprietery ratings data; FDS is aggregator. 12-13x may be fairer for an aggregator facing disruption. | MODERATE |
| 10 | Bear case $170 may not be conservative enough | If correlated risks materialize (AI + competition + headcount), ASV growth 2-3% + margins 30% = FV $130-140. 10-15% probability but meaningful tail risk. | LOW |

### Riesgos

| # | Desafio | Evidencia | Severidad |
|---|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 11 | 3 HIGH risks are correlated, not independent | AI disruption + competitive squeeze + buy-side headcount reduction feed each other. Joint probability > individual. | HIGH |
| 12 | CUSIP antitrust lawsuit survived MTD | Case proceeding in SDNY. $1.93B acquisition at risk. Revenue ~$175M/yr at high margins. If adverse ruling, 10-12% EPS hit. | MODERATE |
| 13 | New CEO = execution risk during critical transition | Viswanathan is an outsider with JPMorgan background. Cloud migration + AI pivot + margin management require deep FactSet institutional knowledge. | MODERATE |
| 14 | Consensus "Reduce" from 19 analysts | Goldman Sachs SELL, Wells Fargo Underweight, Stifel Hold. 0-1 Buys. Unprecedented for quality business at P/E 13x. | MODERATE |
| 15 | Open-source/AI alternatives unbundling the terminal | AlphaSense (#8 CNBC Disruptor 50), Koyfin, API-first data providers. Cloud-native, API-first alternatives at 90% lower cost. | LOW |

### Timing

| # | Desafio | Evidencia | Severidad |
|---|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 16 | No clear near-term catalyst | Q2 FY2026 earnings (March 2026) is next data point. Margin normalization not expected until FY2028. Market may keep FDS in penalty box for 12-18 months. | MODERATE |
| 17 | Margin compression duration uncertain | Management provides no timeline for when investment phase ends. Stifel and Morgan Stanley flag "structurally lower margins" concern. Could be 1-2 years or 3-5 years. | MODERATE |
| 18 | Dead money risk | Stock down 57% from ATH. Could drift at $180-220 for 6-12 months until margin recovery is visible. At current dividend yield 2.2%, total return while waiting is minimal. | LOW |

## Conflictos con Otros Analisis

### vs. Moat Assessment
The moat assessment correctly classified FDS as NARROW (not WIDE). It also correctly identified that FDS is a data aggregator with structurally lower margins than data creators (MSCI, VRSK). However, the moat assessment did NOT mention the CEO transition. The moat assessment's identification of Axioma as a competitor (not partner) is important context that the thesis barely addresses.

### vs. Risk Assessment
The risk assessment is the strongest of the R1 analyses. It correctly identified:
- 3 correlated HIGH risks (AI + unit economics + competitive squeeze)
- The MEDIUM-HIGH overall risk score
- The recommendation for entry at $160-170 (more conservative than thesis's $180)
- The suggestion to wait for Q2 FY2026 earnings as a hard gate

However, the risk assessment also missed the CEO transition (KC#6 already triggered). The risk assessment's recommendation of $160-170 entry is supported by this counter-analysis.

### vs. Valuation Report
The valuation report is methodologically sound and arrives at $225 FV with explicit SBC adjustment. The SBC figure of $61M is confirmed correct from the 10-K. However, the correlated risk discount is not applied. Applying a 7.5% correlated risk haircut: $225 * 0.925 = **$208**. The valuation report's own recommendation of $175 entry (compromise between thesis $180 and risk-identifier $160-170) is reasonable.

## Veredicto Global

| Metric | Valor |
|--------|-------|
| Desafios CRITICAL | 1 (CEO transition missed -- factual error) |
| Desafios HIGH | 3 (ARPU decline, aggregator vulnerability, correlated risks) |
| Desafios MODERATE | 7 |
| Desafios LOW | 4 |
| Total desafios | 15 |
| Desafios no resueltos por thesis | 8 (CEO error, ARPU structural, aggregator margins, correlated risk cluster, CUSIP legal, new CEO execution risk, analyst consensus, timing) |
| Veredicto | **MODERATE COUNTER** |

### Interpretacion:

**MODERATE COUNTER:** The thesis has real gaps. The CEO factual error is embarrassing but correctable. The ARPU decline and correlated risk cluster are the most substantive challenges. The thesis correctly identifies a high-quality business (95% retention, 19% ROIC, 27% FCF margins) at a depressed valuation, but may be underweighting the structural risks that the market is pricing in (hence the 0-1 Buy ratings from 19 analysts).

The thesis DOES survive fundamental scrutiny -- FDS is not a value trap, not in secular decline, and not financially distressed. The business model is sound. But the FV of $225 is likely 5-10% too high, and the entry of $180 is adequate but not generous for a Tier B stock with MEDIUM-HIGH risk and 3 correlated HIGH risks.

## Adjustments Recommended

### Fair Value Adjustment
- **Original thesis FV:** $225 (thesis) / $225 (valuation report)
- **Adversarial correction:** Apply 7.5% correlated risk discount for the triple-threat (AI + competition + headcount) + uncertainty from CEO transition during investment phase
- **Revised FV:** $208 (-7.5%)
- **Revised FV range:** $200-215

### Quality Score Adjustment
- **Original QS:** 73/100 (Tier B) -- no adjustment
- **Adversarial assessment:** QS 73 is fair. The business quality metrics are accurately captured. The CEO transition and structural risks are reflected in the RISK score, not the QS.
- **Revised QS:** 73/100 (Tier B) -- unchanged

### Entry Price Adjustment
- **Original entry:** $180 (22% MoS vs $225)
- **Revised entry at $208 FV:** $180 = 13.5% MoS (below Tier B 20-25% precedent range)
- **Recommended entry:** $165-170 (20-22% MoS vs revised $208 FV), consistent with risk-identifier's recommendation
- **Standing order at $170:** 18% MoS vs $208 -- acceptable for Tier B with wide moat component (switching costs strong)

### Kill Conditions Update Required
1. **KC#6 (CEO Departure) must be REPLACED** -- Snow already departed. New KC should be: "KC#6: Viswanathan departure within 18 months of appointment OR strategic direction reversal (e.g., abandoning cloud migration, major acquisition >$3B)."
2. All other KCs are appropriate and correctly specified.

### Conviction Score: 10/20

Reasoning:
- Business quality is genuinely high (95% retention, 19% ROIC, 27% FCF) = +5
- Price is genuinely depressed (P/E 13x, down 57%) = +3
- Structural risks are real and correlated (AI + competition + headcount) = -3
- CEO transition during critical investment phase adds execution risk = -1
- 0-1 Buy ratings from 19 analysts is a strong negative signal = -2
- No clear near-term catalyst (margin recovery FY2028 at earliest) = -1
- Margin of safety at $180 entry is inadequate for risk profile = -1

Net: 10/20 -- thesis is neither strong nor destroyed. It describes a real opportunity but with material risks that the current entry price does not fully compensate for.

---

## Recomendacion al Investment Committee

1. **CORRECT the thesis** to reflect the CEO transition (Viswanathan replaced Snow September 2025). This is a factual error that must be fixed before any further pipeline progression.

2. **REVISE FV downward** from $225 to $200-210 to incorporate correlated risk discount and CEO transition uncertainty.

3. **LOWER entry price** from $180 to $165-170. At $170, MoS = 19-22% vs revised FV range, consistent with Tier B precedents (ROP at 22% MoS).

4. **HARD GATE: Q2 FY2026 earnings (March 2026).** Wait for: (a) ASV growth trend (holding at 5.9%? or decelerating?), (b) revenue-per-user trajectory (stabilizing? or declining further?), (c) Viswanathan's first strategic commentary as new CEO, (d) margin compression trajectory (within or outside guidance range?).

5. **Monitor CUSIP lawsuit** -- any settlement or adverse ruling changes the risk profile materially. The $1.93B acquisition is at stake.

6. **Compare vs VRSK** -- VRSK has proprietary data creation (better moat), higher margins (73% GM vs 53%), and similar growth (8-10%). If VRSK reaches actionable entry, it is likely a superior alternative in the same sector. The thesis should explicitly document why FDS over VRSK.

## 🔄 META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres
- **SBC data reconciliation:** MacroTrends shows $152M vs 10-K showing $61.2M. I confirmed $61.2M from the primary source (FactSet's Q4/FY2025 press release), but the discrepancy needs deeper investigation. MacroTrends may be including capitalized SBC, acquisition-related equity awards, or other line items. For now, $61M is used, but if the true economic cost is closer to $100-150M, the valuation impact is material (FV drops $15-30).
- **New CEO effectiveness:** Viswanathan is 5 months into the role. Too early to evaluate. His JPMorgan background in consumer and wealth management COULD be specifically relevant (wealth is FDS's fastest-growing segment at 10%). But he has no experience running a data/analytics company, which is fundamentally different from running a bank division.
- **AI disruption timeline:** The moat assessment gives 3-7 years for AI to meaningfully erode FactSet's analytics moat. The buy-side headcount reduction is slower than feared per Fortune reporting. The actual timeline is genuinely uncertain. If it is 10 years (not 5), the stock is extremely cheap. If it is 3 years, the stock may not be cheap enough.

### Limitaciones de Este Analisis
- Could not access the full 10-K filing to verify SBC breakdown by type and fully reconcile the MacroTrends discrepancy
- Could not find detailed data on FactSet's product-level revenue breakdown (how much comes from analytics vs data vs CUSIP vs workflow)
- Limited access to the detailed terms of the CUSIP antitrust litigation (discovery stage, trial date, potential damages)
- Could not assess the quality of FactSet's AI products (Mercury, MCP server, Transcript Assistant) vs competitors in a hands-on way

### Sugerencias para el Sistema
- **Add "CEO transition risk" as a standard risk factor** for any company where the thesis relies on leadership continuity. The fact that this major event was missed suggests the news-monitor or fundamental-analyst pipeline has a gap in catching corporate governance changes.
- **ARPU monitoring:** For subscription businesses, add revenue-per-user/seat tracking to the standard moat health metrics. This is the canary in the coal mine for pricing power erosion.
- **Analyst consensus as contrarian signal:** When 0-1 out of 19 analysts recommend Buy, and we are considering buying, the thesis must explicitly address this extreme consensus. Not because analysts are always right, but because the burden of proof is on the contrarian.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator
1. The CEO transition (Snow -> Viswanathan) was not caught by the fundamental-analyst. Should we add a corporate governance check (CEO changes, board changes, CFO departures) to the standard R1 checklist?
2. Should we lower FDS entry from $180 to $165-170 per this counter-analysis and the risk-identifier's recommendation?
3. VRSK is in our R3 pipeline at FV $185, entry $150. Given that VRSK has proprietary data (better moat) and higher margins than FDS, should we prioritize VRSK over FDS in the same sector?
4. The MacroTrends SBC discrepancy ($152M vs $61M) -- should we task quant-tools-dev to pull the actual 10-K SBC note via SEC EDGAR API to resolve this?
