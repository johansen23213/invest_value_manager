# Investment Thesis: British American Tobacco (BATS.L)
## Framework Version 2.0

**Status**: WATCHLIST
**Date**: 2026-02-04
**Quality Score**: 6.5/10 (Tier B)
**Decision**: WATCHLIST - Entry at 4000-4200 GBp for 25% MoS

---

## 1. Resumen Ejecutivo

British American Tobacco (BAT) is the world's second-largest listed tobacco company by market cap (~GBP 98B), operating in 180+ markets with iconic brands (Lucky Strike, Dunhill, Kent, Newport, Camel, Natural American Spirit) and a growing smoke-free portfolio (Vuse, Velo, glo). The stock trades at P/E 32.7x trailing (distorted by GBP 31.5B goodwill impairment in 2023), but normalized P/E ~10-11x and forward P/E ~7x.

**Why it's cheap:** ESG divestment, cigarette volume decline (-8.9% in 2024), regulatory overhang, and concerns about smoke-free transition execution vs Philip Morris.

**My contra-thesis:** BAT's smoke-free products now represent 18.2% of revenue and are growing (Velo Plus +380% US growth). Pricing power in combustibles offsets volume decline. Net debt/EBITDA on track to reach 2.0-2.5x by end 2026. GBP 1.3B buyback in 2026 + 5.3% yield = 12%+ total yield.

**Catalizador principal:** FY25 results (Feb 12, 2026), 2026 guidance execution, smoke-free profitability milestone.

**Fair Value:** 5800-6300 GBp (blended methods)
**Current Price:** 4545 GBp
**Margin of Safety:** 22-28% vs blended FV

**However:** We already own IMB.L (Imperial Brands) at 5.4% weight. Adding BATS.L creates tobacco concentration risk. IMB.L is cheaper (P/E 8.1x vs BATS 10-11x normalized), has lower debt, and a simpler story. BATS.L is WATCHLIST unless significant pullback.

## 2. Business Understanding

### 2.1 Modelo de Negocio

| Aspecto | Descripcion |
|---------|-------------|
| Problema que resuelve | Delivers nicotine to addicted consumers (must-have due to physiological dependency) |
| Cliente target | Adult smokers (declining) + nicotine users transitioning to smoke-free alternatives |
| Como genera ingresos | Consumables: cigarettes (~82%), smoke-free/NGP (~18%) |
| % ingresos recurrentes | ~100% - all repeat purchases, highly sticky |

**Revenue Mix (H1 2025):**
- Traditional tobacco: 81.8% (declining ~2-3% annually in revenue, volumes -8-9%)
- Smoke-free (Vuse, Velo, glo): 18.2% (growing mid-single digit overall, Velo +40%)

**Geographic Mix:**
- US: ~50% of profits (Newport, Camel, Natural American Spirit, Vuse, Velo)
- Western Europe: ~25%
- Rest of World: ~25%

### 2.2 Unit Economics

Traditional tobacco unit economics are unique due to addiction:

| Metrica | Valor | Benchmark | Comentario |
|---------|-------|-----------|------------|
| CAC | ~$0 | N/A | No acquisition needed - addiction drives repeat |
| LTV | Very High | N/A | Lifetime smoker spends thousands |
| LTV/CAC | Infinite | >3x good | Unique economics of addiction |
| Customer tenure | ~30 years | N/A | Smoking is lifelong habit for most |
| Churn | <5%/year | N/A | Quit rates + mortality |
| Pricing power | Strong | | +5-8% annual price increases absorbed |

**Smoke-Free Unit Economics (emerging):**
- Velo Plus margins improving to contribution margin ~10.6%
- ZYN (PM competitor) has 70% gross margins - BAT targeting similar
- Vuse facing illicit competition headwinds, revenue flat/down

### 2.3 Estructura de Margenes

| Margen | FY24 | 5y Avg | Tendencia | vs IMB.L |
|--------|------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Gross Margin | ~78% | ~77% | Stable | Similar |
| Operating Margin (adj) | ~42% | ~41% | Stable | Lower (IMB 48%) |
| Net Margin | ~18% | ~22% | Compressed (impairment) | Lower |
| FCF Conversion | >95% | ~95% | Strong | Similar |

**Key Observation:** Operating margin lower than IMB.L (42% vs 48%) due to higher investment in smoke-free transition. This is a strategic choice - BAT is spending more to pivot while IMB.L is more asset-light.

### 2.4 Por Que Esta Barata

**Narrativa del mercado:**
- [X] Secular industry decline (cigarette volumes -3-9%/year depending on market)
- [X] ESG exclusion pressure (institutional divestment accelerating)
- [X] Regulatory risk (plain packaging, flavor bans, generational bans)
- [X] Smoke-free execution lagging Philip Morris (IQOS dominates heated tobacco, ZYN dominates pouches)
- [X] High debt from Reynolds American acquisition (2017)
- [X] GBP 31.5B goodwill impairment (Dec 2023) - signal of US brand decline

**Mi contra-tesis:**

| Mercado cree | Yo creo | Mi evidencia | Prob equivocado |
|--------------|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Volumes declining = dying business | Pricing power > volume decline = flat-to-growing profits | FY25E: ~2% revenue growth despite -8% volumes | 25% |
| Smoke-free transition failing | Velo Plus is #2 in US pouches and growing 380% | Market share from 6.9% to 21.9% in 12 months | 30% |
| Too much debt | Deleveraging on track: 2.4x now, 2.0-2.5x target end 2026 | ITC stake sale, FCF generation, buybacks paused | 20% |
| ESG makes uninvestable | Already priced in; ESG selling creates opportunity | P/E 10-11x vs PM 25x; yield 5.3% vs PM 3.3% | 15% |

### 2.5 Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | SI/NO | Comentario |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Industria en declive secular | **SI** | Cigarette volumes -3-9%/year globally |
| Disrupcion tecnologica inminente | NO | NGP is managed transition, not disruption |
| Management destruyendo valor | NO | GBP 2.4B+ returned annually (div + buyback) |
| Balance deteriorandose | **BORDERLINE** | Net debt GBP 30.4B, but deleveraging on track |
| Insider selling masivo | NO | No unusual activity |
| Dividend cut reciente/probable | NO | Progressive policy, 65% payout, well-covered |
| Perdida market share >2pp/3y | **SI** | Losing share in heated tobacco (glo vs IQOS), but gaining in pouches |
| ROIC < WACC ultimos 3 anos | **SI** | ROIC 6-8% vs WACC ~8-9% - value destruction |
| FCF negativo >2 anos | NO | FCF GBP 8-9B annually, extremely stable |
| Goodwill >50% equity | **SI** | GBP 60B+ goodwill vs GBP 47B equity (128%) |

**Total SI: 4/10**

**VERDICT:** Borderline value trap. The 4 SI factors (secular decline, market share loss in heated tobacco, ROIC < WACC, goodwill >50% equity) are concerning. However:
- Secular decline mitigated by pricing power
- Market share loss in heated tobacco offset by gains in pouches
- ROIC depressed by amortization of acquired intangibles - FCF ROIC is higher
- Goodwill impairment already taken (GBP 31.5B)

**TIER CLASSIFICATION:** Tier B (25% MoS required) - not Tier A due to value trap concerns, not Tier C because FCF is real and dividend is covered.

## 4. Proyecciones

### 4.1 Drivers de Revenue

| Driver | Valor | Fuente |
|--------|-------|--------|
| TAM global tobacco | ~$900B (declining value slowly) | Industry reports |
| TAM growth | -1 to +1% (volume decline offset by pricing) | WHO, company data |
| BAT market share | ~12% global volume | Company reports |
| BAT share trend | Stable-to-declining (except pouches) | Competition from PMI |
| Pricing power | Strong (+5-8%/year absorbed) | Historical track record |

**Revenue Growth Derivation:**
```
Cigarette volume decline: -4%/year (company guidance)
Cigarette pricing: +5-6%/year
= Cigarette revenue: +1-2%
Smoke-free growth: +mid-single-digit (Vuse down, Velo up)
= Total revenue growth: +2-3% (company guidance: lower end of 3-5% algo in 2026)
```

**Projected Revenue Growth:**
| Case | Revenue Growth | Rationale |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| Bear | 0% | Vuse headwinds worsen, pricing resistance |
| Base | +2.5% | Company guidance (lower end of 3-5% algo) |
| Bull | +4% | Velo accelerates, Vuse stabilizes, pricing holds |

### 4.2 Proyeccion de Margenes

| Ano | Revenue Growth | Op Margin (adj) | FCF Margin |
|-----|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| FY25 (actual) | +2% | ~42% | ~35% |
| FY26E | +2.5% | ~42.5% | ~35% |
| FY28E | +3% | ~43% | ~36% |

### 4.3 WACC Derivado

**Cost of Equity (Ke):**
```
Risk-free rate (UK 10Y Gilt): 4.50%
Equity Risk Premium: 4.50%
Beta: 0.63 (yfinance - defensive, tobacco)
Ke = 4.50% + (0.63 x 4.50%) = 7.34%
```

**Cost of Debt (Kd):**
```
Interest expense / Total Debt: ~5.4%
Tax rate: ~23%
Kd after-tax: 5.4% x (1-0.23) = 4.16%
```

**Capital Structure:**
```
Market Cap: GBP 98.6B
Net Debt: GBP 30.4B
EV: GBP 129B
E/V: 76%
D/V: 24%
```

**WACC:**
```
WACC = (76% x 7.34%) + (24% x 4.16%) = 6.58%
Rounded/conservative: 7.5% (add buffer for tobacco risk)
```

### 4.4 Terminal Growth

Terminal growth: 0% (zero)
- Tobacco is a declining industry
- Smoke-free may offset but unlikely to grow GDP+
- Conservative assumption - any positive terminal is upside

---

## 5. Valoracion Multi-Metodo

### 5.1 Metodo 1: DCF (40% weight)

**From dcf_calculator.py with derived parameters (growth 2.5%, WACC 7.5%, terminal 0%):**

| Escenario | Prob | Growth | WACC | Terminal | Fair Value |
|-----------|------|--------|------|----------|------------|
| Bear | 25% | 0% | 8.5% | -0.5% | 4720 GBp |
| Base | 50% | 2.5% | 7.5% | 0% | 6297 GBp |
| Bull | 25% | 4% | 6.5% | 0.5% | 8532 GBp |

**DCF Expected Value:** (4720 x 0.25) + (6297 x 0.50) + (8532 x 0.25) = **6461 GBp**

### 5.2 Metodo 2: DDM (40% weight)

**Parameters:**
- Current dividend: 240.24p per year
- Required return: 9% (conservative for Tier B)
- Dividend growth: 3% (company: progressive policy, ~3% historical CAGR)

**Gordon Growth Model:**
```
D1 = 240.24 x 1.03 = 247.45p
FV = 247.45 / (0.09 - 0.03) = 4124 GBp
```

**DDM Scenarios:**
| Case | g | Required r | Fair Value |
|------|---|------------|------------|
| Bear | 2.0% | 9.5% | 3268 GBp |
| Base | 3.0% | 9% | 4124 GBp |
| Bull | 4.0% | 8.5% | 5554 GBp |

**DDM Expected Value:** (3268 x 0.25) + (4124 x 0.50) + (5554 x 0.25) = **4267 GBp**

Note: DDM produces lower value than DCF because BAT's payout ratio (65%) is lower than IMB.L. More FCF is being reinvested/used for buybacks.

### 5.3 Metodo 3: EV/EBIT Normalizado (20% weight)

**Parameters:**
- EBIT (adj, normalized): ~GBP 12.5B
- Net Debt: GBP 30.4B
- Shares: ~2.17B

**Multiple Selection:**
- Consumer staples base: 12-16x
- Tobacco discount for secular decline: -4x
- Adjusted multiple: 10x (conservative)

**Calculation:**
```
EV = 12.5B x 10 = GBP 125B
Equity Value = 125B - 30.4B = GBP 94.6B
FV per share = 94.6B / 2.17B = 4359 GBp
```

### 5.4 Reconciliacion de Metodos

| Metodo | Fair Value | Peso | Weighted FV |
|--------|-----------|------|-------------|
| DCF (Expected) | 6461 GBp | 40% | 2584 GBp |
| DDM (Expected) | 4267 GBp | 40% | 1707 GBp |
| EV/EBIT | 4359 GBp | 20% | 872 GBp |
| **Blended Fair Value** | | 100% | **5163 GBp** |

**Conservative Fair Value Range: 4700 - 5800 GBp**

**Why methods diverge:**
- DCF higher because FCF > dividends paid (buybacks absorb excess)
- DDM lower because payout ratio is only 65%
- EV/EBIT conservative due to 10x multiple

**Current Price: 4545 GBp**
**MoS vs Blended (5163 GBp): 12%**
**MoS vs DCF Base (6297 GBp): 28%**
**MoS vs Conservative Range Low (4700 GBp): 3%**

## 6. Escenarios Bear/Base/Bull

| Escenario | Prob | Assumptions | Fair Value | MoS |
|-----------|------|-------------|------------|-----|
| Bear | 25% | Vuse fails, glo stagnates, pricing power erodes, leverage stays high | 3800-4200 GBp | -8% to +8% |
| Base | 50% | 2026 guidance achieved (lower end), Velo continues momentum, deleverage to 2.5x | 5000-5800 GBp | +10% to +28% |
| Bull | 25% | Smoke-free reaches profitability, glo Hilo succeeds in Japan, leverage to 2.0x | 6500-8000 GBp | +43% to +76% |

**Expected Value:**
```
EV = (4000 x 0.25) + (5400 x 0.50) + (7250 x 0.25) = 5513 GBp
```

**MoS vs Expected Value: 17%**
**MoS vs Bear Case: -14% to +8%** (could be underwater in bear scenario)

---

## 7. Moat Assessment

| Aspecto | Evaluacion |
|---------|------------|
| Tipo | Narrow |
| Fuentes | Intangibles (brands, addiction), regulatory barriers, cost advantage (scale) |
| Evidencia cuantitativa | ROIC 6-8% vs WACC 7.5% = value neutral to destructive |
| Durabilidad estimada | 15-20 years (smoke-free transition creates uncertainty) |
| Amenazas principales | 1. IQOS dominance in heated tobacco 2. Illicit vapes 3. Generational smoking bans |

**Moat Score: Narrow (not Wide)**

Reasons not Wide:
- ROIC < WACC (value destruction, not creation)
- Market share losses in key categories (heated tobacco)
- Heavy investment required to maintain position (smoke-free capex)
- Goodwill impairment signals brand value erosion

---

## 8. Riesgos

| Riesgo | Prob | Impacto | Mitigante |
|--------|------|---------|-----------|
| Smoke-free transition fails | M | Alto | Diversified portfolio (Vuse, Velo, glo), pricing power in combustibles |
| Regulatory ban (generational/flavor) | M | Alto | Geographic diversification, NGP provides some hedge |
| Illicit vape competition worsens | A | Medio | FDA enforcement improving, Vuse Ultra launch |
| Deleveraging stalls | B | Medio | ITC stake sale, strong FCF generation |
| Interest rate spike | B | Medio | Fixed-rate debt, manageable maturities |
| ESG divestment accelerates | A | Bajo | Already largely priced in |

**Kill Conditions (vender inmediatamente si ocurre):**
1. Dividend cut
2. Net Debt/EBITDA > 3.5x
3. US regulatory ban on all nicotine products
4. FCF < GBP 5B for 2 consecutive years

---

## 9. Catalizadores

| Catalizador | Timeframe | Prob | Impacto |
|-------------|-----------|------|---------|
| FY25 results (Feb 12, 2026) | 0-1m | Alta | +/-5-10% |
| 2026 guidance confirmed | 0-3m | Alta | +5-10% if at/above lower end |
| Velo Plus continues US momentum | 6-12m | Media | +10-15% |
| glo Hilo Japan success | 6-12m | Baja | +5-10% |
| Leverage reaches 2.0x | 12-24m | Alta | +5-10% multiple re-rating |
| Smoke-free reaches breakeven | 2-3y | Media | +15-20% re-rating |

---

## 10. Conexion Macro

| Factor Macro | Sensibilidad | Status Actual | Impacto |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|---------|
| Tasas de interes | Media | Estable (Fed 3.5-3.75%) | Neutral |
| Recesion | Baja | Baja probabilidad | Tobacco is defensive |
| Inflacion | Baja | Moderada (~3%) | Can pass through via pricing |
| GBP strength | Media | GBP/EUR ~1.16 | Mixed (UK listing, global ops) |

**Fit con World View:** NEUTRAL - Tobacco is defensive in uncertain environment, but not a priority sector. Already have IMB.L exposure.

---

## 11. Comparacion vs IMB.L (nuestra posicion actual)

| Metrica | BATS.L | IMB.L | Ventaja |
|---------|--------|-------|---------|
| P/E Forward | ~7x | ~8x | BATS |
| P/FCF | ~11x | ~8x | IMB |
| Dividend Yield | 5.3% | 5.1% | BATS |
| Net Debt/EBITDA | 2.4x | 2.5x | BATS |
| Operating Margin | 42% | 48% | IMB |
| FCF Yield | ~9% | ~10.3% | IMB |
| Smoke-free % | 18.2% | 7% | BATS |
| Smoke-free growth | +mid single digit | +13.7% | IMB (faster from lower base) |
| Value Trap Score | 4/10 | 1/10 | IMB |
| ROIC vs WACC | ROIC < WACC | ROIC > WACC | IMB |
| Beta | 0.63 | 0.14 | IMB (more defensive) |

**Conclusion:** IMB.L is cheaper on FCF basis, has higher margins, generates value (ROIC > WACC), and has lower value trap risk. BATS.L has more smoke-free optionality and is more diversified, but execution risk is higher.

**Recommendation:** Do NOT replace IMB.L with BATS.L. IMB.L is the better value play in tobacco. BATS.L is WATCHLIST for opportunistic add if it drops significantly.

---

## 12. Portfolio Fit y Constraints

**Current Portfolio:**
- IMB.L: 5.4% weight (tobacco/consumer staples)
- Consumer Staples total: 8.4% (IMB.L + TATE.L)
- UK exposure: 23%
- Cash: 18.7%

**If add BATS.L (400 EUR):**
- BATS.L: 4.1% weight
- Tobacco total: 9.5% (IMB.L + BATS.L) - CONCENTRATION RISK
- Consumer Staples total: 12.5%
- UK exposure: 27.1%
- Positions: 19/20

**Constraint Analysis:**
- Max position BATS.L allowed: 676 EUR (to stay under 7%)
- No sector constraint violation (Consumer Staples/Defensive not capped at 25%)
- UK geography approaching 27% (watch limit)

**Key Question:** Do we want 9.5% in tobacco?
- Pro: Both stocks are cheap, high yield, defensive
- Con: Concentrated bet on one declining industry, similar risk factors

**Recommendation:** If adding tobacco exposure, prefer to ADD to existing IMB.L position rather than open new BATS.L position. IMB.L is simpler, cheaper, and we already understand it.

## 13. Decision

| Campo | Valor |
|-------|-------|
| Recomendacion | **WATCHLIST** |
| Tier | B |
| MoS requerido | 25% |
| MoS actual | 12-17% (vs blended/expected value) |
| Entry Price Target | **4000-4200 GBp** (for 22-25% MoS vs 5163 blended) |
| Sizing sugerido | 3% (EUR 300) if entry target hit |
| Fair Value (Blended) | 5163 GBp |
| Fair Value (Conservative) | 4700-5800 GBp |
| Horizonte | 3-5 years |

**NOT BUY NOW because:**
1. MoS 12-17% < 25% required for Tier B
2. Already own IMB.L at 5.4% - tobacco concentration risk
3. ROIC < WACC (value destruction) - need bigger discount
4. Value trap score 4/10 - not clean story
5. IMB.L is better value in same sector

**WATCHLIST because:**
1. Strong FCF generation (GBP 8-9B annually)
2. Deleveraging on track
3. Velo Plus showing real momentum
4. Dividend well-covered, progressive policy
5. If drops to 4000-4200 GBp, becomes compelling

---

## 14. Autocritica

| Aspecto | Respuesta |
|---------|-----------|
| Asunciones no validadas | 1. Pricing power will persist despite volume acceleration 2. Velo Plus can compete with ZYN long-term |
| Sesgos posibles | 1. High yield bias (attracted to 5.3% yield) 2. Contrarian bias (ESG selloff = opportunity?) |
| Que me haria cambiar de opinion | 1. ROIC improves to >WACC 2. Smoke-free reaches profitability 3. Stock drops 12%+ to entry zone |
| Mi ventaja informacional | Limited - tobacco is well-covered, story is known |
| Que podria estar mal | 1. Smoke-free transition more expensive than expected 2. US regulatory action 3. IQOS continues to dominate heated tobacco |

---

## 15. Standing Order (for human)

**Entry Trigger:** 4000-4200 GBp (~10-12% below current)
**If triggered:**
- Buy EUR 300 (3% position)
- Total tobacco exposure would be ~8.5% (acceptable)
- Re-evaluate if drops further

**Do NOT buy now at 4545 GBp** - insufficient margin of safety for Tier B stock with value trap concerns.
