# BAH - Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation

## TL;DR

Booz Allen Hamilton is the #1 US government IT services/consulting firm with 22,000+ security-cleared employees, creating a deep moat. The stock has fallen 39% from ATH ($131 to $80) due to DOGE contract cuts, civil segment collapse (-22% YoY), a Treasury breach scandal, CFO resignation, and 2,500 layoffs. FY2026 revenue guidance cut from $12.0-12.5B to $11.3-11.4B. However, defense/intelligence (65% of revenue) remains resilient with $38B backlog, CEO bought $2M in shares at ~$85, and the $1.5T FY2027 defense budget proposal is a structural tailwind. At $80 / P/E 11.9x, the market prices in permanent impairment; my thesis is that DOGE impact is cyclical (civil ~35% revenue) while defense/intel moat is structural.

## Quality Score

**QS Tool: 73/100 (Tier B)**

**QS Adjusted: 68/100 (Tier B) -- Adjustment: -5 points**

Adjustment rationale (quantitative):
1. **FCF Margin distortion (-3 pts):** Tool shows 7.6% FCF margin (FY2025) but FY2024 was only 1.8% (anomalous acquisition/working capital year). Normalized FCF margin is ~6-7%, which is low for Tier A aspiration. The 4-year FCF trajectory ($657M, $527M, $192M, $911M) is inconsistent.
2. **Market Position default (-2 pts):** Tool gives 0/8 for market position (manual input required). BAH is #1 in federal IT consulting by revenue -- should be 8/8. However, the tool's known bias (per decisions_log) gives free points elsewhere that offset this. Net effect: tool score is slightly overstated given FCF inconsistency, so -5 net.

**Note:** Even with the manual market position correction (+8), the FCF inconsistency and leverage (Net Debt/EBITDA 2.6x, not bad but not great) keep this firmly Tier B, not A.

| Category | Tool Score | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Financial | 27/40 | ROIC spread +18pp excellent; FCF margin weak at 2-8%; leverage 2.6x ok; FCF consistency 4/4 |
| Growth | 23/25 | Revenue CAGR 12.7%; EPS CAGR 28.1%; GM expanding |
| Moat | 17/25 | GM +26.8pp vs sector; market position 0/8 (should be 8/8 manual); ROIC persistence 7/7 |
| CapAlloc | 6/10 | Dividend yield 3.0%, payout 32.6%; insider only 1.1% (CEO 1.6%) |
| **Total** | **73/100** | **Tier B** |

## Business Understanding

### The Business Model

Booz Allen Hamilton is the largest pure-play US government IT services and consulting firm. The company provides management consulting, analytics, digital solutions, engineering, and cybersecurity services almost exclusively to the US federal government (98% of revenue).

**Problem solved:** The US government needs external expertise for technology modernization, cybersecurity, AI/ML implementation, data analytics, and mission-critical consulting. Federal agencies lack internal technical talent -- especially in areas requiring security clearances -- and rely on contractors like BAH to execute.

**Revenue model:** Project-based (cost-reimbursable, T&M, and fixed-price contracts). Revenue is recognized as services are rendered. Not SaaS-style recurring, but contracts typically run 3-7 years with strong recompete win rates, creating quasi-recurring revenue.

**Revenue mix (FY2024 basis, most recent clean year):**
| Segment | % Revenue | FY2024 Growth | FY2026 Outlook |
|---------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Defense | 47% | +20% YoY | Stable to growing |
| Civil | 34% | +18% YoY | **Declining ~22% YoY** (DOGE impact) |
| Intelligence | 17% | +5% YoY | Stable, growing in cyber/AI |
| Commercial | 2% | N/A | Immaterial |

**Contract types:** Mix of cost-plus-fixed-fee (~50%), time-and-materials (~30%), and firm-fixed-price (~20%). Cost-plus contracts pass costs through with a fee margin, limiting downside risk but also capping upside. T&M provides moderate margin. FFP carries more risk but higher potential margins.

### Unit Economics

- **Gross Margin:** 54.8% (FY2025), expanding from 53.4% (FY2022). This is very high for a services company and reflects the premium nature of cleared-workforce consulting.
- **Operating Margin:** 11.4% (FY2025), up from 8.2% (FY2022). Volatile -- dropped to 4.8% in FY2023.
- **FCF Margin:** Normalized ~6-7%. FY2025 was 7.6% ($911M) but FY2024 was only 1.8% ($192M -- acquisition/WC anomaly).
- **Capital intensity:** Low. Capex ~$50-60M/year on $12B revenue (<1%). This is an asset-light, people-based business.
- **LTV/CAC:** Not applicable in traditional sense. Government contracting has no "customer acquisition cost" per se -- it's recompete-based with incumbency advantage. Win rates on recompetes are typically 80-90%.

### Margin Structure and Trends

| Year | Gross Margin | Operating Margin | FCF Margin | Revenue |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|---------|
| FY2022 | 53.4% | 8.2% | 7.9% | $8.4B |
| FY2023 | 53.5% | 4.8% | 5.7% | $9.3B |
| FY2024 | 53.8% | 9.5% | 1.8% | $10.7B |
| FY2025 | 54.8% | 11.4% | 7.6% | $12.0B |
| FY2026E | ~54% | ~10.5% | ~6-7% | $11.3-11.4B |

The gross margin expansion is positive -- it reflects BAH's shift toward higher-value digital/AI/cyber work vs. traditional body-shop consulting. However, operating margin has been volatile, and FCF is lumpy.

### Why It Is Cheap: Narrative and Counter-Thesis

**The market believes:**
1. **DOGE will permanently reduce government consulting spend.** Civil segment (~35% of revenue) is being decimated. Defense Department cancelled $5.1B in contracts across BAH/Accenture/Deloitte.
2. **Treasury breach scandal is a reputational catastrophe.** All $21M Treasury contracts cancelled. The Littlejohn data breach compromised 406,000 taxpayers. Reputational damage could spread to other agencies.
3. **Revenue is declining, not growing.** Q3 FY2026 revenue -10.2% YoY. FY2026 guidance cut from $12.0-12.5B to $11.3-11.4B.
4. **Leadership instability.** CFO resigned February 2026. 2,500 layoffs underway. Morale risk.
5. **Government shutdown impact.** 43-day shutdown hurt Q3 by ~$30M revenue and $15M profit.

**My counter-thesis:**

| Market Belief | My View | Evidence | Prob Market Wrong |
|--------------|---------|----------|-------------------|
| DOGE permanently impairs BAH | Civil decline is cyclical; defense/intel (65%) is structural moat | $38B backlog, $1.5T FY2027 defense budget proposal, 22K cleared staff | 55% |
| Treasury breach is fatal | Localized scandal, $21M is 0.2% of revenue, other agencies still awarding | $561M WHS contract awarded post-breach (Feb 2026), $1.58B DIA contract (Aug 2025) | 70% |
| Revenue decline is permanent | Trough year, defense/intel growing, civil bottoming | Book-to-bill 1.41x TTM (6yr high), backlog $38B (+2% YoY), AI business $800M+ growing 30%+ | 50% |
| Leadership is broken | CEO is stable, bought $2M in stock, CFO departure is manageable | CEO Rozanski bought 23,800 shares at ~$85 (Oct 2025), COO serving as interim CFO | 65% |

### Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | YES/NO | Comment |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Industry in secular decline | NO | Government IT spending growing (AI, cyber, digital modernization) |
| Technological disruption imminent | PARTIAL | AI could automate some consulting tasks, but BAH is an AI provider, not victim |
| Management destroying value | NO | CEO buying shares, layoffs are cost discipline, not panic |
| Balance sheet deteriorating | NO | Net Debt/EBITDA 2.6x, stable; interest coverage 7.4x |
| Insider selling massively | NO | 4 buys, 0 sells in past year. CEO bought $2M |
| Dividend cut recent/probable | NO | Dividend maintained, payout ratio 32.6% (comfortable) |
| Losing market share >2pp | UNCLEAR | Market share hard to measure in government contracting; recompete win rates are strong |
| ROIC < WACC last 3 years | NO | ROIC 23.6% vs WACC 5.6% -- massive spread |
| FCF negative >2 years | NO | FCF positive all 4 years (though FY2024 was very low at $192M) |
| Goodwill >50% equity | NO | Manageable goodwill levels; not a serial acquirer |

**Value Trap Score: 0.5/10** (only partial on AI disruption). Low risk of value trap.

### Competitive Moat

**MOAT ASSESSMENT: WIDE (7/10)**

BAH has three reinforcing moat sources:

1. **Security Clearance Workforce (primary moat):** 22,000+ of 35,000 employees hold security clearances. These take 6-18 months to obtain (TS/SCI can take 2+ years). Competitors cannot quickly scale cleared workforce. This is a structural barrier -- not replicable by throwing money at the problem. The supply of cleared workers is fundamentally constrained.

2. **Incumbency Advantage:** Government contracts have 80-90% recompete win rates. Once BAH is embedded in a client mission, switching is extremely costly and risky for the government. BAH understands legacy systems, has institutional knowledge, and has cleared staff already in place.

3. **AI/Digital Technology Leadership:** BAH's AI business topped $800M+ growing 30%+ YoY. This is not just traditional body-shop consulting -- BAH is building proprietary AI tools for defense/intelligence missions. This differentiates from commodity IT services.

**Moat threats:**
- DOGE could structurally reduce the number of contracts (not just delay them). If agencies permanently reduce outsourcing to consultants, the TAM shrinks.
- AI could automate some consulting tasks, reducing the number of bodies needed. But BAH is positioning as an AI provider, not just a labor provider.
- Budget sequestration (as happened in 2013) could freeze spending. Currently low probability given $1.5T FY2027 proposal.

### My Informational Advantage

- **Horizonte temporal mas largo:** The market is pricing DOGE disruption as permanent. Government contracting has ALWAYS been cyclical -- budget cuts, sequestrations, shutdowns are normal. BAH survived 2013 sequestration and grew through it.
- **Mercado sobre-reacciona:** -39% decline for a company with $38B backlog, 22K cleared staff, and $800M AI business growing 30%+ is likely an overreaction.
- **Mis datos cuantitativos:** P/E 11.9x is the lowest in BAH's history as a public company (IPO 2010). Historical P/E range: 12-25x.

### Catalizadores

| Catalyst | Timeline | Probability | Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------|--------|
| FY2027 defense budget ($1.5T proposal) | Feb-Oct 2026 | 60% (some version passes) | HIGH - structural demand driver |
| Civil segment bottoming/stabilization | Q4 FY2026 - Q1 FY2027 | 50% | MEDIUM - ends revenue decline narrative |
| FY2026 Q4 earnings beat (May 2026) | May 2026 | 45% | MEDIUM - proves trough |
| DOGE scaling back (political exhaustion) | H2 2026 | 40% | MEDIUM - restores confidence |
| New contract wins (AI/cyber/space) | Ongoing | HIGH | MEDIUM - validates moat |
| P/E reversion to mean (15-18x) | 12-24 months | 50% | HIGH - 25-50% upside from multiple alone |

### Kill Conditions

1. **KC#1:** Defense segment revenue declines >10% YoY for 2 consecutive quarters (structural moat breach)
2. **KC#2:** Book-to-bill ratio falls below 1.0x TTM for 2 consecutive quarters (demand destruction)
3. **KC#3:** Security clearance workforce drops below 18,000 (moat erosion)
4. **KC#4:** DOGE-driven contract cancellations exceed $2B cumulative (tipping point)
5. **KC#5:** Dividend cut (signals management views FCF as unsustainable)
6. **KC#6:** CEO departure (Rozanski is the strategic anchor)

### Macro Connection

- **US defense budget:** Structural tailwind. $1.5T FY2027 proposal (vs $901B FY2026). Even a fraction of this increase benefits BAH.
- **DOGE:** Structural headwind for civil segment. But DOGE is targeting wasteful spending broadly, not specifically IT consulting for defense/intel.
- **Interest rates:** Low sensitivity. Government spending is independent of rates.
- **Recession:** Low sensitivity. Defense spending is counter-cyclical. Civil spending may decline further in recession, but it's already declining 22%.
- **AI/cyber megatrend:** Strong tailwind. BAH's AI business growing 30%+. Cybersecurity is a priority for every government agency.

## Growth Projections (Bottom-Up)

### TAM Analysis

- **US federal IT spending TAM:** ~$120B annually, growing 5-7% (driven by AI, cloud, zero-trust cyber)
- **US defense services TAM:** ~$50-60B, growing 3-5% organically
- **BAH market share:** ~10% of federal IT services (largest single player)

### Revenue Projection

| Driver | Bear | Base | Bull |
|--------|------|------|------|
| Defense segment (47% rev) | +2% (flat budgets) | +5% (modest budget growth) | +8% (FY2027 $1.5T realized) |
| Intelligence (17% rev) | +3% (stable) | +6% (AI/cyber growing) | +10% (AI acceleration) |
| Civil (34% rev) | -15% (further DOGE cuts) | -5% (bottoming, gradual recovery) | +3% (DOGE reversal) |
| **Blended Revenue Growth** | **-3%** | **+3%** | **+7%** |

### Margin Projection

| Metric | Bear | Base | Bull |
|--------|------|------|------|
| Gross Margin | 53% (compression) | 54% (stable) | 56% (AI mix shift) |
| Operating Margin | 9% (cost pressure) | 11% (stable) | 12.5% (operating leverage) |
| FCF Margin | 5% | 7% | 9% |

### WACC Derivation

```
Risk-Free Rate: 4.3% (10Y Treasury, Feb 2026)
Equity Risk Premium: 5.5% (elevated uncertainty)
Beta: 0.35 (yfinance) -- BUT this is artificially low
  Beta reflection: 0.35 beta for a government contractor facing DOGE disruption
  is clearly understated. BAH has fallen 39% from ATH while S&P is near highs.
  Historical beta for govcon is 0.7-0.9. Using 0.80 as more realistic.
Adjusted Ke: 4.3% + 0.80 * 5.5% = 8.7%
Kd (pre-tax): 4.6% (interest expense / total debt)
Tax Rate: 23.3%
Kd (after-tax): 4.6% * (1 - 23.3%) = 3.5%
E/V: 75% (market cap $9.7B / EV ~$13B)
D/V: 25%
WACC: (75% * 8.7%) + (25% * 3.5%) = 7.4%

Using 9.0% for margin of safety (government contract execution risk + DOGE uncertainty)
```

### Terminal Growth: 2.5% (below GDP, reflecting government spending grows with nominal GDP but with periodic budget discipline cycles)

## Valuation (Multi-Method)

### Method 1: EV/EBIT Normalized (60% weight) -- Primary for services company

**EBIT Normalization:**
- FY2025 EBIT: ~$1.37B (op margin 11.4% on $12.0B)
- FY2024 EBIT: ~$1.02B (op margin 9.5% on $10.7B)
- FY2023 EBIT: ~$447M (op margin 4.8% on $9.3B -- anomalous)
- Excluding FY2023 anomaly, normalized EBIT: ~$1.0-1.2B
- Using FY2026E EBIT: ~$1.19-1.20B (midpoint $1.2B based on adjusted EBITDA guidance $1.2B minus ~$50M D&A)

**Multiple derivation:**
- BAH historical EV/EBIT: 12-20x (median ~15x)
- Government IT services peers: LDOS 14x, SAIC 9x, CACI 18x, KBR 12x. Median ~13x.
- BAH deserves slight premium vs peers for: (a) highest gross margin, (b) AI business growing 30%+, (c) largest cleared workforce
- Fair multiple: 13-15x EV/EBIT (conservative vs own history, modest premium vs peers)

**Calculation:**
```
Low estimate: $1.2B EBIT x 13x = $15.6B EV
  - Net Debt $3.25B = $12.35B equity / 120.5M shares = $102/share

High estimate: $1.2B EBIT x 15x = $18.0B EV
  - Net Debt $3.25B = $14.75B equity / 120.5M shares = $122/share

Midpoint: $112/share
```

Using the lower end (13x) to be conservative given DOGE headwinds: **FV = $102**

### Method 2: P/E with Growth Adjustment (40% weight) -- Secondary

**Earnings basis:**
- FY2026E adjusted EPS: $5.95-6.15 (guided). Midpoint $6.05.
- FY2027E EPS (base case, +3% growth + margin stability): ~$6.30-6.50
- Normalized EPS (FY2026-FY2027 average): ~$6.20

**P/E multiple:**
- BAH historical P/E: 12-25x. Current: 11.9x (lowest ever as public company)
- Peer P/E: LDOS 16.4x, SAIC 11.2x, CACI 25.0x, KBR 13.0x
- Fair P/E for BAH given quality (ROIC 23.6%, GM 55%, AI growth 30%+, cleared moat): 14-16x
- Discounting for DOGE/uncertainty: 13-15x

**Calculation:**
```
Low: $6.05 x 13x = $78.65
Mid: $6.20 x 14x = $86.80
High: $6.20 x 15x = $93.00

Using midpoint: FV = $87
```

### Reconciliation

| Method | Fair Value | Weight | Weighted |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| EV/EBIT (13x normalized) | $102 | 60% | $61.20 |
| P/E (14x FY26-27 normalized) | $87 | 40% | $34.80 |
| **Weighted Average** | | **100%** | **$96** |

**Rounding to $95 for conservatism (government contract visibility, but DOGE tail risk).**

### DCF Cross-Check

The DCF tool with 5% growth and 9% WACC gives $105.63 base case. With 3% growth (reflecting near-term DOGE headwinds) and 9.5% WACC, it gives $86.02 base case.

**DCF Sensitivity Assessment:**
- TV as % of EV: 72-74% (HIGH -- characteristic of services companies)
- FV Spread: 92-97% (HIGH)
- Interpretation: DCF is UNRELIABLE as a point estimate for BAH. The sensitivity to growth and WACC assumptions is extreme. This is why I weight EV/EBIT (60%) as primary -- it uses observable multiples and normalized earnings rather than projecting 5-10 years of FCF.

DCF range ($86-106 base cases) is consistent with my $95 weighted FV. The bear case DCF ($64-78) provides the downside floor.

## Scenarios

| | Bear (25%) | Base (50%) | Bull (25%) |
|--|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Narrative** | DOGE expands, civil permanently shrinks, defense flat | Civil bottoms FY2027, defense grows modestly, gradual recovery | DOGE reversed, $1.5T defense budget, AI boom |
| **Revenue Growth** | -3% CAGR (3yr) | +3% CAGR (3yr) | +7% CAGR (3yr) |
| **FY2028E EBIT** | $1.0B | $1.3B | $1.6B |
| **EV/EBIT Multiple** | 10x | 13x | 16x |
| **Fair Value** | $60 | $95 | $140 |
| **MoS from current $80** | -25% | +19% | +75% |

**Expected Value:** ($60 x 0.25) + ($95 x 0.50) + ($140 x 0.25) = $15 + $47.50 + $35 = **$97.50**

---

## Margin of Safety

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current Price | $80.06 |
| Fair Value (weighted) | $95 |
| MoS vs Base FV | **+19%** |
| MoS vs Expected Value | **+22%** |
| MoS vs Bear Case | **-25%** (downside risk) |
| Tier B typical MoS (precedents) | 20-25% |
| **Does MoS meet threshold?** | **BORDERLINE -- 19% MoS for Tier B with HIGH risk (DOGE)** |

**Assessment:** The 19% MoS vs base case is BELOW the typical 20-25% for Tier B observed in our precedents. Given the elevated risks (DOGE structural, Treasury scandal, CFO departure, civil segment -22%), I would want to see 25%+ MoS to compensate. This suggests an entry price of approximately **$70-72** (25% below FV of $95), not the current $80.

---

## Entry Price Recommendation

**Entry Price: $70** (MoS 26% vs $95 FV)

Reasoning:
- $70 provides 26% MoS, consistent with Tier B precedents for elevated-risk situations
- $70 is 46% below 52w high ($131) and 9% below 52w low ($77) -- waiting for potential further DOGE/shutdown-related weakness
- At $70, P/E would be ~11.6x on FY2026E EPS, and ~10.8x on normalized earnings -- historically cheap
- Catalyst timeline: FY2026 Q4 earnings (May 2026) and FY2027 defense budget could trigger recovery
- If defense budget disappoints or DOGE expands further, $70 may be achievable

Alternative entry: $75 (MoS 21%) if Q4 FY2026 earnings are strong and civil segment shows early bottoming signals.

---

## Peer Comparison

| Ticker | P/E | Yield | MCap | ROIC | Comment |
|--------|-----|-------|------|------|---------|
| **BAH** | **11.9x** | **3.0%** | **$9.7B** | **23.6%** | Highest ROIC, cheapest P/E, largest cleared workforce |
| LDOS | 16.4x | 1.4% | $22.6B | 16.4% | Premium valuation, diversified defense/health |
| SAIC | 11.2x | 1.8% | $4.0B | N/A | Similar valuation, smaller, less differentiated |
| CACI | 25.0x | 0.0% | $12.9B | N/A | Premium for higher growth, intelligence focus |
| KBR | 13.0x | 1.6% | $5.3B | N/A | International exposure, engineering focus |

BAH trades at the lowest P/E among major govcon peers despite having the highest ROIC and largest cleared workforce. This discount is justified by DOGE risk but may be excessive if civil stabilizes.

---

## Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISK factors:

1. **DOGE structural risk (CRITICAL):** DOGE has already cancelled 61 BAH contracts ($207M). If DOGE expands beyond civil agencies to defense/intel consulting, the moat is threatened. The civil segment (~35% of revenue) is projected to decline ~22% FY2026.

2. **Customer concentration (HIGH):** 98% of revenue from US federal government. No diversification. A single policy change (like DOGE) can materially impact the entire business.

3. **Treasury breach reputational risk (MEDIUM-HIGH):** The Littlejohn data breach affected 406,000 taxpayers. All Treasury contracts ($21M) cancelled. Could other agencies follow? The reputational damage of a security breach at a company whose core value proposition is handling sensitive government data is significant.

4. **CFO resignation (MEDIUM):** CFO Calderone resigned effective Feb 1, 2026. Interim CFO is the COO. This adds uncertainty during a critical transition period.

5. **Government shutdown risk (MEDIUM):** The 43-day shutdown already cost ~$30M revenue and $15M profit in Q3 FY2026. Further shutdowns are likely given political dysfunction.

### MEDIUM RISK factors:

6. **Leverage (MEDIUM):** Net Debt/EBITDA 2.6x. Not dangerous but limits flexibility. Interest coverage 7.4x is adequate.

7. **AI disruption to traditional consulting (MEDIUM):** AI could reduce demand for traditional body-shop consulting. BAH is positioning as an AI provider, but the transition is uncertain.

8. **Political cycle (LOW-MEDIUM):** Different administrations have different spending priorities. DOGE under Trump 2.0 is particularly hostile to consulting contracts.

### Risk Rating: HIGH (2 critical, 2 high, 1 medium-high = 5 material risks)

---

## Veredicto: WATCHLIST -- Entry at $70

**Reasoning:**

BAH is a HIGH-QUALITY business (ROIC 23.6%, 22K cleared workforce, $38B backlog, AI business growing 30%+) going through a CYCLICAL trough caused by DOGE contract cuts. The stock has fallen 39% and trades at its lowest P/E ever (11.9x). However:

1. **MoS at $80 is insufficient.** At 19% MoS for a Tier B company facing CRITICAL DOGE risk, I need 25%+ MoS per precedents.
2. **Near-term catalysts are uncertain.** Civil segment is still declining, DOGE is still active, and Treasury breach is recent.
3. **Downside risk is material.** Bear case is $60 (-25% from here).
4. **$70 entry provides adequate MoS** (26%) and is achievable if Q4 FY2026 disappoints or DOGE escalates.

**Decision consistent with precedents:**
- ROP standing order at $300 (22% MoS for Tier B with high risk) -- BAH at $70 would have 26% MoS, consistent.
- Pattern: For Tier B with elevated risk, we set standing orders at prices that provide 20-25%+ MoS, not buy at current price with insufficient MoS.

**Next steps:**
- Monitor Q4 FY2026 earnings (May 2026) for civil segment bottoming signals
- Monitor FY2027 defense budget progress
- If price reaches $70, submit for R2 (devil's advocate) and R4 (investment committee)
- Add to quality_universe with entry $70

## META-REFLECTION

### Incertidumbres/Dudas
- **DOGE permanence is the core uncertainty.** I cannot determine with confidence whether DOGE contract cuts are a one-time adjustment or a permanent structural shift in how the US government uses consultants. The historical pattern (e.g., 2013 sequestration) suggests cyclical, but DOGE has political backing that sequestration did not.
- **Civil segment breakdown by sub-agency unclear.** I could not obtain granular data on which civil agencies are cutting most aggressively. This matters because some civil work (HHS, DHS cyber) may be more resilient than others (USAID, EPA).
- **Contract type mix data was unavailable** in precise percentages. The approximate 50/30/20 (cost-plus/T&M/FFP) is estimated from contract examples, not from official disclosure.
- **FCF FY2024 anomaly ($192M) is not fully explained.** Was this acquisition-related? Working capital timing? The 4-year FCF trajectory is genuinely inconsistent and undermines confidence in FCF-based valuation.

### Sugerencias para el Sistema
- **Defense/govcon sector view needs BAH added** to "Empresas Objetivo" as analyzed company with entry price $70.
- **quality_universe.py** should be updated with BAH: QS 68 adjusted, FV $95, entry $70, sector Defense/Government Services, Tier B.
- The sector view currently does not list BAH at all (focused on defense primes and aftermarket). BAH is a government IT services company that straddles defense and technology sectors. Consider whether it belongs in defense-aerospace or a separate "government-services" sector view.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator
1. Should BAH be classified under defense-aerospace sector view or should a new "government-IT-services" sector view be created? BAH's peers (LDOS, SAIC, CACI) are not typical defense/aerospace companies.
2. Given that entry at $70 requires a further 13% decline from current $80, and the stock is already near 52w low ($77), should we set a standing order now or wait for Q4 FY2026 earnings (May 2026) to validate the civil bottoming thesis first?

### Anomalias Detectadas
- **Beta of 0.35 is clearly wrong** for BAH's actual risk profile. The stock fell 39% while the market is near highs. yfinance beta calculations are unreliable for stocks that have recently experienced regime changes. I used 0.80 in WACC, which better reflects the government contractor risk profile.
- **Quality_scorer.py classified BAH in "Industrials" sector with "Consulting Services" industry.** For gross margin premium calculation, it compared BAH's 55% GM against 28% sector median. The relevant comparison should be government IT services (peers have 25-35% GM), which would still show a premium but less extreme than the +26.8pp reported.
- **CEO insider ownership at 1.1%** seems low, but Rozanski owns $58M worth of shares and actively bought $2M more at the bottom. The low percentage is because BAH has a $9.7B market cap. In absolute terms, the CEO has significant skin in the game.
