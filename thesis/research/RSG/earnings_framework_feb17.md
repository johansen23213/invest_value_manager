## Consensus Expectations

| Metric | Consensus | Source |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Q4 Revenue | ~$4.25B (est.) | Based on FY guide $16.85-16.95B |
| FY2025 Revenue | $16.85-16.95B | Management guided |
| FY2025 Adj EBITDA Margin | ~32%+ | Management guided |
| FY2025 Adj FCF | $2.32-2.36B | Management guided |
| FY2025 EPS | ~$6.0-6.2 | Estimated from prior quarters |
| FY2026 Revenue Guide | ~$17.8B (5-6% growth) | Thesis assumption |
| FY2026 EBITDA Margin Guide | ~32.5%+ (30-50bps expansion) | Management algorithm |

## Key Metrics to Watch

### 1. Pricing vs Volume Split (CRITICAL)
- **Thesis assumption:** 4.5% pricing + 0.5% volume = 5% organic
- **Watch for:** Pricing yield > 4% confirms CPI pass-through intact
- **Red flag:** Volume negative or pricing < 3% (competitive pressure)

### 2. EBITDA Margin Trajectory
- **Thesis:** 29.7% (2024) -> 32%+ (2025) -> 32.5% (2026)
- **Watch for:** Q4 EBITDA margin >= 32% confirms expansion algorithm
- **Red flag:** Margin flat or declining YoY

### 3. FCF Quality
- **Thesis:** $2.32-2.36B FY2025 guide
- **Watch for:** FCF conversion >100% of net income, capex as % revenue stable ~11-12%
- **Red flag:** Capex surge without corresponding revenue growth

### 4. FY2026 Guidance (MOST IMPORTANT)
- **Thesis needs:** Revenue ~$17.5-18B, EBITDA margin ~32.5%+, FCF ~$2.4-2.5B
- **Bull:** Revenue guide >$18B + margin >32.5% = thesis upgrade
- **Bear:** Revenue guide <$17.3B or margin compression = thesis risk

### 5. M&A Pipeline Commentary
- **Thesis:** 20-40 tuck-in acquisitions/year at 6-8x EBITDA
- **Watch for:** Pipeline remains robust, integration on track
- **Red flag:** Acquisition multiples expanding or pipeline drying up

### 6. Environmental Solutions Segment
- **Thesis:** Mid-20s EBITDA margin, growing
- **Watch for:** Continued margin expansion post-US Ecology integration
- **Red flag:** Margin regression or customer losses

### 7. Recycled Commodity Prices
- **Watch for:** Commentary on recycled materials pricing trends
- **Impact:** Tailwind if commodity prices rising, headwind if falling

## Scenarios

| Scenario | Probability | Description | Pipeline Action |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **BULL** | 25% | FY2025 beats on all metrics + FY2026 guide above street + margin expansion accelerating | Proceed to R2 immediately; consider tightening entry to $215-220 |
| **BASE** | 50% | Meets/slightly beats guidance, FY2026 guide in line with thesis (~5.5% rev growth, 32.5% margin) | Proceed to R2; maintain FV $255, entry $210 |
| **BEAR** | 20% | Misses on FCF or margin; FY2026 guide disappoints (<5% rev growth) | Pause pipeline; re-evaluate FV downward |
| **KILL** | 5% | Revenue decline, margin collapse, M&A write-downs, or competitive disruption | Remove from universe |

---

## Decision Framework Post-Earnings

```
IF Bull or Base scenario:
  -> Launch R2 (devil's advocate)
  -> Keep standing order at $210
  -> Monitor for Q1 2026 validation

IF Bear scenario:
  -> Pause R2
  -> Revise FV downward (target $220-240 range)
  -> Revise entry downward (target $185-195)
  -> Keep in universe but deprioritize

IF Kill scenario:
  -> Remove from universe
  -> Document lesson learned
```

## Kill Conditions to Verify

1. ROIC dropping toward WACC (currently +2pp spread — tight)
2. Pricing power erosion (yield < CPI)
3. Landfill capacity concerns
4. M&A integration failures (write-downs)
5. FCF margin compression below 12%
