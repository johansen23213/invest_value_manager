## Financial Summary

### Income Statement Trajectory

| Metric | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | TTM Q3'25 |
|--------|------|------|------|------|-----------|
| Revenue | $11.3B | $13.5B | $15.0B | $16.0B | ~$16.5B |
| Gross Profit | $4.6B | $5.3B | $6.0B | $6.7B | ~$7.0B |
| EBIT | $1.9B | $2.2B | $2.7B | $3.0B | ~$3.2B |
| Net Income | $1.3B | $1.5B | $1.7B | $2.0B | ~$2.1B |
| EBITDA (norm) | $3.2B | $3.7B | $4.4B | $4.8B | ~$5.2B |
| Diluted EPS | $4.05 | $4.70 | $5.47 | $6.50 | ~$6.80 |

### Margin Trajectory

| Metric | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | TTM Q3'25 |
|--------|------|------|------|------|-----------|
| Gross Margin | 40.3% | 39.3% | 40.2% | 41.7% | ~42.5% |
| Operating Margin | 18.5% | 17.9% | 19.0% | 20.1% | ~21.0% |
| EBITDA Margin | 28.0% | 27.2% | 28.7% | 29.7% | ~31.5% |
| Net Margin | 11.4% | 11.0% | 11.6% | 12.8% | ~13.0% |
| FCF Margin | 13.0% | 12.8% | 13.3% | 13.0% | ~13.5% |

**Trend:** ALL margins expanding. EBITDA margin expansion of 30-50 bps/yr is sustainable per management algorithm and supported by route optimization, pricing power, and US Ecology synergies.

### Cash Flow Bridge

| Item | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 |
|------|------|------|------|------|
| Operating Cash Flow | $2,787M | $3,190M | $3,618M | $3,936M |
| Capex | -$1,316M | -$1,454M | -$1,631M | -$1,855M |
| **Free Cash Flow** | **$1,470M** | **$1,736M** | **$1,987M** | **$2,081M** |
| SBC | $57M | $39M | $41M | $42M |
| **FCF (SBC-adjusted)** | **$1,413M** | **$1,697M** | **$1,946M** | **$2,039M** |
| FCF / Revenue | 13.0% | 12.8% | 13.3% | 13.0% |
| FCF / Net Income | 114% | 117% | 115% | 102% |

**Key observation:** FCF consistently exceeds net income by 100-117%, indicating high cash conversion quality. SBC is IMMATERIAL ($42M on $2.1B FCF = 2.0%).

### Balance Sheet

| Item | 2024 |
|------|------|
| Cash | $84M |
| Total Debt | $13.5B |
| Net Debt | $13.4B |
| Net Debt / EBITDA | 2.6x |
| Interest Coverage (EBIT/Interest) | 5.5x |
| Interest Expense | $539M |
| Goodwill | ~$18B |
| Total Equity | ~$13B |
| Shares Outstanding | 310M (declining via buybacks) |

**Leverage assessment:** 2.6x Net Debt/EBITDA is moderate and appropriate for the waste industry. Interest coverage of 5.5x is adequate. The high goodwill ($18B) reflects decades of tuck-in M&A, which is the business model -- NOT a red flag for waste operators.

### Capital Allocation

| Item | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 |
|------|------|------|------|------|
| Dividends | $553M | $593M | $638M | $687M |
| Buybacks | $264M | $216M | $263M | $496M |
| **Total Returns** | **$817M** | **$809M** | **$901M** | **$1,183M** |
| M&A | $1,222M | $3,039M | $2,065M | $753M |
| Returns / FCF | 56% | 47% | 45% | 57% |

**Assessment:** RSG returns 45-57% of FCF to shareholders (dividends + buybacks) and invests the rest in tuck-in M&A. 21+ consecutive years of dividend increases. This is textbook disciplined capital allocation for a mature compounder.

## Valuation Method 1: DCF

### Parameters Derived

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Starting FCF | $2,081M | 2024 actual (yfinance) |
| Growth Y1-5 | 7.0% | Revenue 5.5% + margin expansion |
| Growth Y6-10 | 5.0% | Steady state organic |
| WACC | 7.0% | Calculated 6.6%, rounded up for conservatism |
| Terminal Growth | 2.5% | Below GDP, appropriate for waste |
| Projection Years | 10 | Standard for stable businesses |

### DCF Results (Tool Output)

**At 7.5% WACC (tool default from growth 7):**

| Scenario | Fair Value | MoS vs $223 |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Bear | $95.76 | -57.1% |
| Base | $153.70 | -31.2% |
| Bull | $250.43 | +12.2% |

**Sensitivity Matrix (Growth x WACC):**

| Growth \ WACC | 6.0% | 7.5% | 9.0% |
|---------------|------|------|------|
| 4.0% | $180 | $112 | $75 |
| 5.5% | $210 | $132 | $90 |
| 7.0% | $244 | $154 | $106 |
| 8.5% | $282 | $179 | $123 |
| 10.0% | $325 | $207 | $144 |

**At 6.6% WACC (calculated):** FV ~$172 (interpolated from matrix)

**DCF Assessment:**
- TV as % of EV: 66.7% (elevated)
- FV Spread: 162% (HIGH sensitivity)
- The DCF mechanically penalizes RSG for its $13.4B net debt
- DCF Fair Value Range: **$152-$205** depending on WACC (6.0-7.5%)

### Manual DCF Cross-Check

Using SBC-adjusted FCF projections with 7.0% WACC:

```
Year    FCF (SBC-adj)    PV Factor    PV
2025    $2,295M          0.935        $2,145M
2026    $2,442M          0.873        $2,133M
2027    $2,675M          0.816        $2,185M
2028    $2,817M          0.763        $2,151M
2029    $2,980M          0.713        $2,128M
2030    $3,132M          0.666        $2,092M
                         Sum:         $12,834M

Terminal Value = $3,132M * 1.025 / (0.07 - 0.025) = $71,329M
PV of TV = $71,329M * 0.666 = $47,505M

Enterprise Value = $12,834M + $47,505M = $60,339M
Less Net Debt: -$13,400M
Equity Value = $46,939M
Per Share (310M) = $151

TV % of EV = 78.8% (VERY HIGH -- confirms DCF is TV-dominated)
```

**Conclusion:** DCF base case FV = **$151-172** (7.0% to 6.6% WACC). This is significantly below market price, implying the market's premium multiple is NOT justified on a DCF basis alone.

## Valuation Method 2: EV/EBITDA Comparable

### Industry Multiples

| Company | EV/EBITDA | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| WM | ~15x | #1 US waste |
| RSG | ~16x | #2 US waste |
| WCN | ~18x | #3, growth premium |
| Industry median | ~12x | Includes small operators |
| RSG 5-year range | 13-17x | |

### Forward EV/EBITDA Valuation

| Multiple | EBITDA | EV | -Net Debt | Equity | /Share |
|----------|--------|-----|-----------|--------|--------|
| 12x (recession trough) | $5,000M | $60,000M | $13,400M | $46,600M | **$150** |
| 14x (historical low-end) | $5,300M | $74,200M | $13,400M | $60,800M | **$196** |
| 15x (sector average) | $5,300M | $79,500M | $13,400M | $66,100M | **$213** |
| 16x (current market) | $5,300M | $84,800M | $13,400M | $71,400M | **$230** |
| 17x (premium) | $5,500M | $93,500M | $13,400M | $80,100M | **$258** |

### Forward Multiple Selection

**Base case: 15x on 2025E EBITDA = $213**

Rationale: 15x is the appropriate multiple because:
1. It is the sector average for the duopoly
2. It represents a slight discount to current trading (16x)
3. It accounts for potential multiple compression in a higher-rate environment
4. WM trades at 15x, and RSG should trade at par or slight discount as #2

**Forward case: 16x on 2026E EBITDA of $5,500M = $255**

Rationale: If margin expansion continues and 2026 guidance confirms growth trajectory, the market will re-rate to current or higher multiples on higher EBITDA.

## Valuation Method 3: Owner Earnings Yield

### Calculation

```
Operating Cash Flow (2024): $3,936M
Maintenance Capex estimate:
  - Total Capex: $1,855M
  - Depreciation (excl depletion/amort): $1,003M
  - Estimated maintenance capex: ~$1,300M (1.3x depreciation)
  - Growth capex: ~$555M

Owner Earnings = $3,936M - $1,300M - $42M (SBC) = $2,594M

Market Cap: $69,700M
Owner Earnings Yield: $2,594M / $69,700M = 3.72%

Expected FCF Growth: ~7%
OEY + Growth = 3.72% + 7.0% = 10.72%
vs WACC of 6.6-7.0%
Spread: +3.7-4.1pp
```

### Interpretation

| Metric | RSG | Tier A precedent (ADBE) | Tier B precedent (ROP) |
|--------|-----|------------------------|------------------------|
| OEY | 3.72% | ~4.5% | ~4.0% |
| Growth | 7.0% | 12% | 8% |
| OEY + Growth | 10.72% | 16.5% | 12.0% |

RSG's OEY + Growth of 10.7% is acceptable but not exceptional. It is below typical Tier B thresholds observed in precedents (~12%+). This confirms the stock is approximately fairly valued, not undervalued.

## Fair Value Summary

| Method | Fair Value | Weight | Contribution |
|--------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| DCF (7.0% WACC) | $152 | 20% | $30.4 |
| DCF (6.6% WACC) | $172 | 10% | $17.2 |
| EV/EBITDA (15x trailing) | $213 | 25% | $53.3 |
| EV/EBITDA (16x forward) | $255 | 30% | $76.5 |
| OEY framework | ~$230 | 15% | $34.5 |
| **WEIGHTED FAIR VALUE** | | **100%** | **$212** |

**Issue:** This weighted average of $212 suggests RSG at $223 is slightly OVERVALUED (-5%).

However, the thesis FV header states $255 using forward metrics. This is because:
1. Q4 earnings + 2026 guidance (Feb 17) are expected to confirm ~$5.5B EBITDA
2. If confirmed, the forward FV at 16x is $255
3. The current price is "buying ahead of the catalyst"

**HONEST ASSESSMENT: The weighted average of trailing methods gives $212. The forward estimate gives $255. The truth is somewhere in between.**

**FINAL FAIR VALUE: $255** (forward, contingent on 2026 guidance confirmation)
**CONSERVATIVE FAIR VALUE: $213** (trailing, no guidance dependence)
**ENTRY TARGET: $210** (which provides 18% MoS vs $255, or 1.4% MoS vs $213)

## Scenario Analysis

### Bear Case (20% probability)

**Assumptions:**
- Recession in 2026, waste volumes -8%
- Environmental Solutions remains weak
- No M&A activity (balance sheet caution)
- Multiple compresses to 12x (historical trough)
- EBITDA: $5,000M (flat vs 2024 normalized)

**Bear Fair Value: $150**

### Base Case (55% probability)

**Assumptions:**
- Revenue growth 5-6% (organic + M&A)
- EBITDA margin expands 30-50 bps/yr
- Continued tuck-in M&A ($500M-1B/yr)
- 2026E EBITDA: $5,500M
- Multiple: 16x (market maintains premium)

**Base Fair Value: $255**

### Bull Case (25% probability)

**Assumptions:**
- Strong economic growth, waste volumes +3%
- Environmental Solutions recovery (manufacturing upturn)
- RNG ramp adds high-margin revenue
- Aggressive M&A targets larger operators
- 2026E EBITDA: $5,700M
- Multiple: 18x (re-rate for ESG/infrastructure demand)

**Bull Fair Value: $310**

### Expected Value

```
EV = ($150 * 0.20) + ($255 * 0.55) + ($310 * 0.25)
   = $30 + $140.25 + $77.50
   = $247.75

Current Price: $223
MoS vs EV: ($248 - $223) / $248 = 10.1%
MoS vs Base: ($255 - $223) / $255 = 12.5%
MoS vs Bear: ($150 - $223) / $150 = -48.7%
```

---

## Key Risks

1. **Net debt sensitivity** -- $13.4B net debt means equity value is a leveraged bet on enterprise value. A 10% decline in EV ($8.3B) translates to a 12% decline in equity value.
2. **Multiple compression** -- If interest rates stay higher-for-longer, the market may re-rate waste companies from 16x to 14x EV/EBITDA, implying ~$196 per share (-12%).
3. **Recession** -- While waste is recession-resistant, volumes can dip 5-10% and high-margin landfill/ES volumes are more cyclical.
4. **Environmental liabilities** -- Landfills carry long-tail environmental liability (PFAS, contamination). A major event could cost $1-2B+.
5. **M&A execution risk** -- RSG spent $7B on acquisitions in 2021-2024. Poor integration could weigh on returns.
6. **Insider ownership at 0.1%** -- Management has minimal skin in the game.
