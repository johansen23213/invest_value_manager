# DNLM.L - Dunelm Group plc

> **Fair Value:** 1,008p
> **Pipeline Stage:** R4_APPROVED
> **Status:** R4 APPROVED | Committee-adopted FV (was 1,328p thesis, -24% correction)
> **Standing Order:** 780p (22.6% MoS). Entry approved by investment-committee.

## TL;DR

UK's #1 homewares retailer (7.9% market share, targeting 10%) trading at 936p, down 25% from 52-week high after subdued Christmas trading and profit guidance to lower end of consensus. Quality Score 79 (Tier A, confirmed by tool) with ROIC spread +16.8pp, gross margin 52.4% (+17pp vs sector), 38.5% insider ownership (founder family), and FCF yield 11.1%. Owner Earnings Yield + Growth of 16-17% vs 9% WACC represents the best spread of any Tier A candidate in our pipeline. Interim results on 10 February 2026 (3 days away) are a near-term catalyst -- RBC recently upgraded to "outperform" with 1,300p target, and a 25p special dividend is expected to be announced.

## Business Understanding

### What Dunelm Does

Dunelm is the UK's largest homewares and home furnishing specialist retailer. Founded in 1979 by Bill Adderley as a curtain stall in Leicester market, it has grown to 200+ superstores across the UK plus a strong digital platform (41% of sales).

**Problem Solved:** One-stop-shop for home furnishing at affordable-to-mid price points. Unlike IKEA (which requires large format destination trips and self-assembly), Dunelm offers a curated, wide range (300,000+ products) in convenient out-of-town superstores with established digital delivery.

**Revenue Model:** Transaction-based retail (not subscription). Revenue is predominantly product sales with a relatively balanced mix of:
- Soft furnishings (curtains, bedding, cushions, rugs) -- higher margin, repeat purchase
- Hard furnishings (furniture, lighting, kitchenware) -- growing share, higher ticket
- Seasonal & decorative -- variable, drives footfall

**Revenue Split:** Digital 41% / In-store 59%. Digital penetration growing ~3pp per year. New mobile app launched February 2026 on Apple and Android.

### Unit Economics

| Metric | Value | Comment |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Gross Margin | 52.4% | +17pp vs sector. Exceptional for a retailer. Private label ~30% of sales drives this. |
| Operating Margin | 12.5% | Healthy for UK retail, improved from 12.1% prior year |
| FCF Margin | 11.9% | Strong cash conversion |
| Capex % Revenue | 2.5% | Asset-medium -- stores are leased (IFRS16), physical capex is modest |
| Revenue/Store | ~GBP 8.8M | Highly productive stores |
| LTV/CAC | Not disclosed | But repeat purchase nature + loyalty platform (6M+ members) = high |

### Capital Intensity and IFRS 16

**CRITICAL CLARIFICATION on D/E of 3.18:**

The headline debt-to-equity ratio of 318% is heavily distorted by IFRS 16 lease accounting.

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Total Debt (reported) | GBP 377.7M |
| Of which: Capital Lease Obligations (IFRS16) | GBP 247.5M |
| Of which: Bank Debt (real financial debt) | GBP 130.2M |
| Cash | GBP 30.0M |
| **Net Debt (ex-leases)** | **GBP 100.2M** |
| EBITDA | GBP 304.6M |
| **Net Debt/EBITDA (ex-leases)** | **0.33x** |

**Conclusion:** Dunelm is effectively unlevered. The 3.18x D/E reflects store leases, not financial risk. The company's leverage covenant (net debt ex-leases < 2.5x EBITDA) is comfortably met. The Board actively returns surplus cash to shareholders when net debt ex-leases falls below 0.2x EBITDA (which triggered the 35p special dividend in FY25).

### Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Market Share | Positioning |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| IKEA | ~10-12% (est.) | Large format, self-assembly, destination shopping |
| **Dunelm** | **7.9%** | **Specialist homewares, convenient superstores + digital** |
| Next Home | ~5% (est.) | Fashion retailer's home extension |
| B&Q | ~4% (est.) | DIY store with home furnishings |
| John Lewis | ~3% (est.) | Premium, department store format |
| The Range | ~3% (est.) | Value, discount positioning |

Dunelm's 7.9% share is growing (from 7.7% in FY24) and the company targets 10% in the medium term. The combined UK homewares + furniture market is ~GBP 22-28B (estimates vary by scope).

### Moat Analysis

**1. Scale + Specialist Focus (Strong):**
- 200+ stores purpose-built for homewares vs competitors who are generalists
- Buying power with 300,000+ SKUs creates assortment moat
- #1 position allows best store locations and supplier terms

**2. Brand + Customer Loyalty (Strong):**
- Dunelm is the best-known homewares brand in the UK (20.1% brand search share, ahead of IKEA at 19.1%)
- 6M+ loyalty members driving repeat purchase and data-driven personalization
- Net Promoter Score consistently high

**3. Private Label (Strong):**
- ~30% private label penetration drives the 52.4% gross margin (+17pp premium)
- Own-brand ranges (Dorma, etc.) are recognized sub-brands
- Competitors struggle to match this margin profile

**4. Omnichannel Integration (Growing):**
- 41% digital sales (growing 3pp/year) with store-pickup options
- Physical stores act as showrooms and fulfillment points
- Competitors like pure-play online (Wayfair) lack physical presence; DIY stores (B&Q) lack curation
- New mobile app launched Feb 2026 strengthens digital engagement

**Moat Durability:** Medium-High. This is not a tech monopoly, but the combination of scale, specialist focus, brand recognition, and private label in a fragmented market creates sustainable competitive advantage. No competitor has replicated this combination. IKEA is the closest threat but serves a different (younger, self-assembly) segment.

## Why It Is Cheap: Narrative vs. Reality

### The Market Narrative (Why Down 25%)

1. **Q2 FY26 sales deceleration:** Growth slowed from 6.2% in Q1 to 1.6% in Q2. Black Friday and December trading were "especially" subdued. H1 total sales GBP 926M (+3.6% YoY).

2. **Profit guidance cut:** FY26 PBT expected at lower end of consensus (GBP 214-222M range, vs GBP 222M consensus midpoint). H1 PBT expected GBP 112-114M. This is NOT a profit warning per se -- it is still profit GROWTH of 1-5% vs FY25's GBP 211M.

3. **Competitive environment:** "Especially high level" of digital marketing and discounting activity in H1. Higher promotional intensity from competitors.

4. **UK consumer weakness:** GfK Consumer Confidence -16 in Jan 2026. Cost of living pressures continue. Discretionary spending cautious.

5. **No sustained recovery visible:** Management explicitly stated they have "yet to see signs of a sustained consumer recovery."

### My Counter-Thesis

| Market Believes | I Believe | My Evidence |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Consumer weakness is structural | Consumer weakness is cyclical (2-3 quarters) | UK inflation at 2%, wage growth positive, housing market stabilizing |
| Profit will decline | Profit will be flat to slightly up | Even at LOW end, FY26 PBT ~214M > FY25's 211M |
| Competitive pressure erodes moat | Competitive pressure is temporary | GM IMPROVED 60bp in H1 despite discounting -- Dunelm is NOT matching competitor pricing |
| Growth is over | Growth continues via share gains | Market share grew to 7.9% (+30bp) DURING this "weak" period. Target 10% intact. |
| Dunelm is a consumer discretionary cyclical | Dunelm has defensive characteristics | People need curtains, bedding, kitchenware. Homewares are replace/refresh. Though a severe recession would defer purchases. |

### Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | SI/NO | Comment |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Industry in secular decline | NO | UK homewares TAM growing 3-4% CAGR |
| Technological disruption imminent | NO | Omnichannel leader, 41% digital |
| Management destroying value | NO | Capital returns, share buybacks, special dividends |
| Balance sheet deteriorating | NO | Net debt/EBITDA 0.33x, improving |
| Insider selling massively | NO | Adderley family holds 38.5%, no recent sales |
| Dividend cut recent/probable | NO | Covered 1.7x by earnings, special dividends continue |
| Market share loss >2pp 3yr | NO | GAINING share: 7.7% to 7.9% |
| ROIC < WACC last 3 years | NO | ROIC ~26%, WACC ~9%, spread +17pp |
| FCF negative >2 years | NO | FCF positive every year, GBP 211M FY25 |
| Goodwill >50% equity | NO | Goodwill negligible (GBP 10.8M) |

**Value Trap Score: 0/10 -- No value trap indicators whatsoever.**

### My Informational Edge

- **Longer time horizon:** The Q2 sales deceleration and profit guidance cut are 1-2 quarter phenomena. I am willing to hold 2-3 years for the market share journey from 7.9% to 10%.
- **Margin resilience misunderstood:** The fact that gross margin IMPROVED 60bp while competitors are discounting heavily tells me Dunelm is NOT competing on price. The market is conflating sector weakness with company weakness.
- **Capital return optionality:** At 0.33x leverage, Dunelm has massive optionality for special dividends and buybacks. FY25 included a 35p special dividend (equivalent to ~3.7% of current share price). Analysts expect a 25p special dividend to be announced at interim results on 10 Feb.

## Projections

### Revenue Projection

| Driver | Value | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| UK Homewares TAM Growth | 3-4% CAGR | Mordor Intelligence: $22B to $27B by 2030 = 4.17% CAGR |
| Market Share Gain | +0.2-0.3pp/year | Trend: 7.7% to 7.9% in FY25. Target 10% in medium term (~5-7 years) |
| Pricing | +1-2% | Private label pricing power, mix shift to higher ticket furniture |
| Store Expansion | 5-10 stores/year | Management guidance. Mainly inner city (London) and relocations |
| **Revenue Growth Base Case** | **5%** | TAM 3.5% + Share 0.5% + Pricing 1% |

### Margin Projection

| Metric | FY25 | FY26E | FY27-28E | Rationale |
|--------|------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Gross Margin | 52.4% | 52.5-53.0% | 53% | Expanding via private label mix, favorable GBP/USD. RBC projects +50-100bp uplift FY26. Competition does NOT compress Dunelm's GM. |
| Operating Margin | 12.5% | 12.1-12.3% | 12.5% | Near-term pressure from increased digital marketing spend, normalizes |
| FCF Margin | 11.9% | 10.5% | 11% | Higher capex FY26 (50-60M guided), normalizes |

### WACC Derivation

| Component | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Risk-Free Rate | 4.2% | UK 10Y Gilt (Feb 2026) |
| Equity Risk Premium | 5.5% | UK market standard |
| Beta | 0.90 | yfinance |
| Cost of Equity (Ke) | 4.2% + 0.9 x 5.5% = 9.15% | CAPM |
| Cost of Debt (Kd) | 4.0% pre-tax | Interest expense / avg debt, low leverage |
| Tax Rate | 26% | UK corporate |
| Kd after-tax | 2.96% | 4.0% x (1-0.26) |
| Debt weight | 5% (ex-leases) | 100M / (1898M + 100M) |
| Equity weight | 95% | |
| **WACC** | **8.8%** | Rounded to **9.0%** (conservative) |

**Sanity check:** Beta 0.9 is reasonable for a UK consumer retailer. Not as defensive as a utility, but less cyclical than pure discretionary. A WACC of 9% is appropriate.

### Terminal Growth: 2.5%

UK GDP long-term growth ~1.5-2%. Dunelm continues to gain share so terminal growth slightly above GDP is justified. 2.5% is conservative.

## Valuation

### Method 1 (Primary, 50% weight): Owner Earnings Yield + Growth

| Metric | Conservative | Adjusted |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Owner Earnings | GBP 211M (reported FCF) | GBP 228M (OpCF - Maintenance Capex only) |
| Market Cap | GBP 1,898M | GBP 1,898M |
| **OEY** | **11.1%** | **12.0%** |
| Expected Growth | 5% | 5% |
| **OEY + Growth** | **16.1%** | **17.0%** |
| WACC | 9.0% | 9.0% |
| **Spread vs WACC** | **+7.1pp** | **+8.0pp** |

**Interpretation:** At an OEY of 11.1% plus expected growth of 5%, the total expected return of 16.1% vastly exceeds the 9% cost of capital. This spread of +7pp is exceptional for a Tier A company.

**Precedent comparison:** NVO at purchase had OEY + Growth ~12-14%. ADBE ~10-12%. MONY.L ~13-15%. Dunelm's 16% is the most attractive of any Tier A in our portfolio.

**Implied Fair Value (OEY targeting 6% yield = quality premium):**
- FV = FCF / 0.06 = 211M / 0.06 = GBP 3,523M equity = 1,739p per share
- MoS = (1739 - 936.5) / 1739 = 46%

**Implied Fair Value (OEY targeting 7% yield = conservative):**
- FV = 211M / 0.07 = GBP 3,020M = 1,491p per share
- MoS = (1491 - 936.5) / 1491 = 37%

### Method 2 (Secondary, 30% weight): EV/EBIT Normalized

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| EBIT (FY25) | GBP 222M | Reported operating profit |
| EBIT Normalized | GBP 218M | Average of FY25 (222M) and FY26E low (214M) |
| Net Debt (ex-leases) | GBP 100M | Conservative |
| Shares Outstanding | 202.6M | |

| Comparable | EV/EBIT |
|------------|---------|
| UK Retail sector median | 8-10x |
| Next plc (premium UK retailer) | 11-12x |
| B&M European Value Retail | 10x |
| Quality premium (Tier A, market leader, 52% GM) | +2x adjustment |
| **Dunelm Fair Multiple** | **10-12x** |

| Multiple | Fair Value | MoS |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| 10x EBIT | 1,046p | 10% |
| 11x EBIT | 1,156p | 19% |
| 12x EBIT | 1,265p | 26% |

**Central estimate:** 11x EBIT = 1,156p. MoS 19%.

Dunelm currently trades at 9.0x EBIT (ex-leases EV/EBIT). The 5-year average is closer to 13-14x. Even at a discount to historic average, 11x is conservative.

### Method 3 (Tertiary check, 20% weight): DDM

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Ordinary DPS (FY25) | 43.5p |
| Special Dividend (FY25) | 35p |
| Dividend Growth | 5% (16.5% 5yr CAGR, but slowing; 5% sustainable) |
| Ke | 9.15% |

- DDM (ordinary only): 43.5 x 1.05 / (0.0915 - 0.05) = **1,100p**
- DDM (with 50% probability of specials): ~1,250p
- MoS (ordinary DDM): 15%
- MoS (with specials): 25%

### Reconciliation

| Method | Fair Value | Weight | Weighted |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| OEY + Growth (conservative, 7% target yield) | 1,491p | 50% | 746p |
| EV/EBIT 11x | 1,156p | 30% | 347p |
| DDM (ordinary + partial specials) | 1,175p | 20% | 235p |
| **Weighted Average** | | **100%** | **1,328p** |

**Weighted Fair Value: 1,328p**
**Current Price: 936.5p** (verified 2026-02-07 via price_checker.py)
**Margin of Safety: 29.5%**

**Divergence between methods:** OEY gives 1,491p, EV/EBIT gives 1,156p = 29% divergence. Below the 30% threshold. The OEY is higher because it capitalizes the high FCF yield at a quality premium; the EV/EBIT anchors to current normalized earnings. Both are valid -- the weighted average of 1,328p is a reasonable compromise.

### DCF Cross-Validation (tool output)

| Scenario | Growth | WACC | Terminal | FV/Share | MoS |
|----------|--------|------|----------|----------|-----|
| Bear (manual) | 3% | 10% | 2% | 1,216p | 30% |
| Base (default) | 5% | 9% | 2.5% | 1,660p | 77% |
| Bull (manual) | 7% | 8% | 3% | 2,387p | 155% |

**Note on DCF tool:** The tool uses net debt of GBP 0.35B which includes IFRS16 lease obligations. This understates fair value. Nevertheless, even the bear-case DCF (3% growth, 10% WACC, 2% terminal) yields 1,216p = 30% MoS, validating that the stock is genuinely undervalued.

### Reverse DCF Insight

At 936.5p, the market is pricing in either:
- 0% FCF growth with a 12% WACC (implying UK-recession-level risk premium), or
- Negative FCF growth at any reasonable WACC

This is an absurd level of pessimism for a company that:
- Grew revenue 3.8% in FY25 during consumer weakness
- GAINED market share
- Has expanding gross margins
- Generated GBP 211M in FCF

### Analyst Consensus

RBC Capital Markets recently upgraded DNLM.L to **"outperform"** from "sector perform" with a **price target of 1,300p** (vs current 936.5p = 39% upside). RBC cited:
- Stronger market share gains
- Gross margin momentum (+50-100bp uplift expected)
- Steady cash returns
- Shares at 13.5x CY26e P/E vs historical 16x = "undemanding"

---

## Scenarios

| | Bear | Base | Bull |
|--|------|------|------|
| **Assumption** | UK recession, consumer collapse, margin compression | Slow recovery, steady share gains, margin stable | Consumer recovery, accelerating share gains, multiple expansion |
| **Revenue Growth** | 0-1% for 2 years then 3% | 5% sustainable | 7% for 3 years, then 5% |
| **Operating Margin** | 11% (compression from competition) | 12.3% (slight near-term pressure) | 13% (operating leverage) |
| **Multiple (EV/EBIT)** | 8x (recession multiple) | 11x (quality retail) | 13x (re-rating to historical) |
| **Fair Value** | 827p | 1,156p | 1,450p |
| **Probability** | 25% | 50% | 25% |
| **Upside/Downside** | -12% | +23% | +55% |

**Expected Value = (827 x 0.25) + (1,156 x 0.50) + (1,450 x 0.25) = 1,147p**

**MoS vs Expected Value: 18%**
**MoS vs Bear Case: -12% (limited downside in Bear)**

The asymmetry is highly favorable: +55% upside in Bull, only -12% downside in Bear. The Bear case requires a UK recession AND margin compression AND multiple contraction -- all three simultaneously.

---

## MoS Assessment

| Measure | Value |
|---------|-------|
| MoS vs Weighted FV (1,328p) | 29.5% |
| MoS vs Expected Value (1,147p) | 18% |
| MoS vs Bear Case (827p) | -12% |
| MoS vs Analyst Consensus (1,280-1,300p) | 27-28% |

**Precedent comparison (Tier A decisions):**
- ADBE: MoS 31%, QS 76, at 52w low -- BUY
- NVO: MoS 38%, QS 82, -49% from high -- BUY
- MONY.L: MoS 36%, QS 81, at 52w low -- BUY
- LULU: MoS 34%, QS 82, -58% from high -- BUY
- AUTO.L: MoS 29%, QS 79, -47% from high -- BUY
- BYIT.L: MoS 35%, QS 81, -47% from high -- BUY

**DNLM.L: MoS 29.5%, QS 79, -25% from high**

This is directly comparable to AUTO.L (same QS 79, same MoS ~29%) which we bought. The key difference is that DNLM.L is only -25% from high (vs AUTO.L at -47%). However, Dunelm's decline is from a MORE reasonable starting valuation (P/E 15-16x at the high) compared to AUTO.L's decline from a much higher starting valuation.

**Reasoning:** A MoS of ~30% for a Tier A company with:
- 0/10 value trap indicators
- Expanding margins despite weak consumer
- Growing market share
- Near-zero leverage
- 38.5% insider ownership (skin in the game)
- 4.8% dividend yield while waiting
- OEY + Growth of 16% vs 9% WACC (best spread in pipeline)

...is acceptable, and consistent with our recent Tier A precedent of AUTO.L at 29% MoS.

## Catalizadores

| Catalyst | Timeline | Probability | Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Interim results + special dividend announcement** | **10 Feb 2026 (3 days)** | **High (80%)** | **+5-10% if results meet low-end + special div confirmed** |
| UK consumer recovery (wage growth > inflation, housing stabilizes) | 6-12 months | Medium (50%) | +15-20% from re-rating |
| Market share progress toward 10% (currently 7.9%) | 2-3 years | High (70%) | +20-30% from revenue growth |
| Ongoing special dividends / buybacks (leverage at 0.33x) | 3-6 months | High (80%) | +5% yield boost |
| New store openings in inner London + App launch | 6-12 months | High (90%) | Higher revenue density, digital engagement |
| FY26 full year results better than guided | September 2026 | Medium (40%) | +10-15% from beat |
| Multiple re-rating from 9x to historical 13x EV/EBIT | 12-24 months | Medium (50%) | +40% from re-rating alone |

**IMPORTANT -- TIMING CONSIDERATION:**
The interim results on 10 February 2026 are 3 days away. This creates two scenarios:
1. **Wait for results:** Risk is that results meet expectations + special dividend announced, stock pops +5-10%, and entry price moves further from target.
2. **Buy before results:** Risk is that H1 PBT disappoints below the already-guided GBP 112-114M, or H2 guidance is cut further, and stock falls toward 850-900p.

Given that management already pre-announced the guidance cut in January (Q2 trading update), the downside surprise risk is lower. The market has already priced in the weak H1. The upside surprise potential comes from: (a) special dividend announcement, (b) gross margin confirmation, (c) any positive H2 commentary.

---

## Kill Conditions

1. **Gross Margin falls below 48%** (currently 52.4%, would indicate moat erosion or forced discounting)
2. **Market share declines for 2 consecutive years** (currently gaining; decline would invalidate growth thesis)
3. **FCF negative for 2 consecutive years** (would indicate broken business model)
4. **Adderley family sells >10% of their 38.5% stake** (would indicate loss of confidence)
5. **Dividend cut >30%** (would indicate cash flow problems more severe than guided)
6. **Net debt ex-leases exceeds 2.0x EBITDA** (currently 0.33x; would indicate balance sheet stress)

---

## Macro Connection

**UK Economic Context (from world/current_view.md, updated 2026-02-05):**
- BCE at 2.0%, Fed at 3.5-3.75% -- rates stable
- UK inflation at 2.0% (target achieved)
- UK GDP projected +1.2% 2026, +1.3% 2027
- Consumer confidence at -16 (weak but improving from -21 low)
- German fiscal stimulus could lift European sentiment

**Sector Sensitivity:**
- **Rates:** Medium sensitivity. Stable rates are neutral. Rate cuts would be positive (mortgage costs drop, housing activity increases, home furnishing spending rises).
- **Recession:** Medium sensitivity. Homewares are more "refresh/replace" than pure discretionary, but would be affected in a severe recession.
- **Inflation:** LOW sensitivity. 52.4% gross margin provides massive buffer. Pricing power through private label.
- **Tariffs:** LOW sensitivity. 100% UK-sourced revenue. Some supply chain from Asia but GBP/USD favorable trend helps margins.

**Consumer Discretionary Sector View (consumer-discretionary.md):**
The sector view now includes a UK Homewares sub-section. DNLM.L is a different sub-segment from athleisure (LULU) with lower cyclicality than fashion. The sector view notes "fallen angels at P/E 12x with ROIC 25%+ represent mispricing."

**UK Exposure Consideration:**
Adding DNLM.L would increase UK exposure. Current UK positions: AUTO.L, MONY.L, IMB.L, TATE.L, DOM.L, BYIT.L. However:
- These are in different sub-sectors (auto classifieds, insurance, tobacco, food ingredients, pub/restaurant, IT services)
- Correlation between Dunelm and these businesses is low (different consumer segments, different macro drivers)
- UK as a geography is "developed stable" (Principle 2)
- The risk is UK-macro (consumer confidence, rates), not Dunelm-specific
- Applying Principle 2: "Is this exposure to similar risks prudent?" -- Yes, because the sub-sector risks are uncorrelated even if the geography is the same.

---

## Veredicto: WATCHLIST -- Entry at 900p or below

### Why not BUY at 936.5p:

1. **MoS of 29.5% is at the lower end of Tier A precedents** (ADBE 31%, NVO 38%, MONY 36%, LULU 34%, BYIT 35%). Only AUTO.L was bought at a similar 29% MoS, and that was a monopoly platform with 50% FCF margin.

2. **UK exposure already significant.** Adding DNLM.L would be the 7th UK position. While correlation is low, a UK-wide macro shock (recession, rates up, sterling crisis) would affect all positions simultaneously.

3. **The decline is relatively shallow (-25% vs -47% for AUTO.L, -58% for LULU, -49% for NVO).** Our best Tier A entries have been at deeper discounts from more panicked selling.

4. **Interim results in 3 days create binary event.** It is prudent to wait and see the actual H1 numbers and H2 commentary before committing capital.

5. **UK consumer outlook remains uncertain.** Consumer confidence at -16 is weak. Management has "yet to see signs of a sustained consumer recovery."

### Why it stays on WATCHLIST (not AVOID):

1. **Quality is exceptional.** QS 79, 0/10 value trap, expanding margins, growing share, net cash (ex-leases), 38.5% insider ownership.

2. **The valuation is already attractive.** OEY + Growth of 16% vs 9% WACC is the best spread in our entire pipeline.

3. **The asymmetry is excellent.** Bear case -12% vs Bull case +55%.

4. **The 4.8% dividend yield (+ probable specials) pays us to wait.** Total yield with specials could be 8%+.

5. **RBC upgrade to "outperform" with 1,300p target** provides independent analytical support.

### Entry Trigger:

**BUY at 900p or below** (MoS 32%+, closer to stronger Tier A precedents)

This could happen if:
- Interim results on 10 Feb disappoint H2 guidance further
- UK consumer confidence deteriorates
- Broader market correction drags UK retail stocks lower

**ALTERNATIVE: If interim results on 10 Feb show H1 PBT at or above GBP 114M, gross margin expanding, special dividend announced, AND stock stays below 960p, consider BUY at current price.** The post-results confirmation would reduce the uncertainty that currently justifies waiting for 900p.

**ADD trigger if bought:** 800p (MoS 40%+, would be exceptional entry)

### Sizing (if entry triggered):

- 3.0-3.5% initial position (consistent with Tier A precedents: ADBE 4.8%, NVO 3.4%, MONY 4.1%, AUTO 3.4%, LULU 3.5%, BYIT 3.5%)
- Slightly conservative within range due to: 7th UK position, consumer discretionary in late cycle
- If falls to 800p, ADD to 5%

## 🔄 META-REFLECTION

### Incertidumbres/Dudas

- **FCF sustainability:** FY25 FCF of GBP 211M benefited from favorable working capital. FY26 forward FCF likely lower (~GBP 188M) due to higher capex (50-60M guided) and guided lower PBT. I used historical FCF for OEY, which may overstate. However, even at GBP 188M forward FCF, the OEY is 9.9% and OEY + Growth is ~15%, which still vastly exceeds WACC.

- **Consumer discretionary classification:** I argued Dunelm has defensive characteristics because homewares are refresh/replace purchases. This may be overly optimistic. In a real recession, people absolutely defer home furnishing purchases. The 2009 and 2020 downturns hit homewares retailers hard (though Dunelm recovered faster than peers both times).

- **Inner London expansion:** The new strategy of opening smaller inner-city stores (Wandsworth, White City) is unproven at scale. These stores may have higher rents and lower revenue density than suburban superstores. Management says initial results are good, but data is limited.

- **IFRS 16 treatment in DCF tool:** The DCF tool includes net debt of GBP 0.35B which includes lease obligations. This slightly understates fair values. My manual EV/EBIT calculation uses ex-lease debt (GBP 100M) which is more appropriate for equity valuation.

- **Interim results binary risk:** Results on 10 Feb 2026 could swing the stock 5-15% either way. If H1 PBT comes in below GBP 112M or H2 guidance is cut further, the stock could reach our 900p entry target quickly. Conversely, if results are solid with a special dividend, the stock may bounce above 1,000p and our entry target becomes harder to reach.

### Sugerencias para el Sistema

- **The D/E metric in quality_scorer.py should ideally distinguish IFRS16 leases from financial debt.** For UK retailers with many leased stores, the headline D/E is misleading. This is a known issue with yfinance data. The leverage component scored 8/10 using reported D/E which includes leases; if adjusted for leases it would score 10/10 and QS would be 81 not 79. Consider flagging in the tool output when IFRS16 may distort leverage.

- **Consumer-discretionary.md sector view has been updated** with UK Homewares sub-section as suggested in the previous version. This addresses the prior meta-reflection item.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator

1. Given interim results are 3 days away (10 Feb), should we set up a **conditional standing order**: BUY at 900p (pre-results dip) OR BUY at current price post-results if results confirm thesis? The post-results scenario is important because the current 936.5p with confirmed fundamentals may be more attractive than waiting for 900p that may never come.

2. UK exposure would be 7 positions. Applying Principle 2: all are in uncorrelated sub-sectors. The macro risk is UK recession/rates/sterling, but our UK positions (AUTO.L = platform, MONY.L = savings, IMB.L = tobacco, TATE.L = food ingredients, DOM.L = pubs, BYIT.L = IT services, DNLM.L = homewares) span very different consumer segments. I believe this is acceptable but flag it for explicit consideration.

### Anomalias Detectadas

- **Reverse DCF anomaly (confirmed):** At current price, the market implies either 12% WACC (very high for a quality UK retailer with beta 0.9) or negative FCF growth. DCF bear case (3% growth, 10% WACC, 2% terminal) still yields 1,216p = 30% MoS. The pessimism level is inconsistent with a company gaining market share and expanding margins.

- **P/B ratio of 1,587x (from yfinance):** This is because book equity is tiny (GBP 118.8M) relative to market cap. Dunelm is an asset-light business (leased stores, intangible brand value) so book value is almost meaningless here.

- **Historical FCF CAGR of -2.5% (from DCF tool):** The tool reports negative FCF growth over the last 4 years. This is misleading because FCF spiked in FY22 (COVID home improvement boom) and has normalized. The normalized FCF of ~GBP 200-210M is actually healthy and growing with revenue. The "decline" is a return to normalcy from an abnormal peak.
