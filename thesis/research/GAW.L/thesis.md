# GAW.L - Games Workshop Group PLC

> Analyst: fundamental-analyst | Date: 2026-02-17 | Framework: v4.0

## TL;DR

Games Workshop is the undisputed global monopoly in tabletop miniature wargaming, with 70%+ gross margins, 100%+ ROIC, net cash balance sheet, and 14%+ revenue CAGR. However, at 16,550 GBp the stock trades at 26.5x P/E with NEGATIVE margin of safety (-27% to -15% depending on method), making it a textbook "wonderful company at a fair/premium price." WATCHLIST until price corrects to entry range of 12,000-13,000 GBp.

## Quality Score

```
QS Tool: 82/100 (Tier A)
QS Adjusted: 80/100 (Tier A) -- Adjustment: -2 for insider ownership at 0.6%
  (tool awards 1/5 = 1pt for >0.5%; however, 0.6% is borderline and lacks
  founder/operator alignment typical of top compounders; -2 is a minor
  qualitative haircut, not requiring quantitative evidence per rule)
```

### Quality Score Breakdown (Tool Output)

| Category | Score | Max | Key Data |
|----------|-------|-----|----------|
| **Financial Quality** | **40/40** | 40 | ROIC-WACC spread +95.4pp, FCF margin 33.4%, Net Cash, FCF+ 4/4yr |
| **Growth Quality** | **21/25** | 25 | Revenue CAGR 14.2%, EPS CAGR 15.0%, GM expanding |
| **Moat Evidence** | **17/25** | 25 | GM premium +37.1pp vs sector, Market position 0/8 (tool default), ROIC persistence 7/7 |
| **Capital Allocation** | **4/10** | 10 | Shareholder returns 3/5, Insider ownership 1/5 |
| **TOTAL** | **82/100** | 100 | **Tier A -- Quality Compounder** |

**Note on Market Position**: The tool defaults market position to 0/8 because it cannot assess this automatically. GAW is the uncontested #1 in tabletop miniature wargaming globally. A manual assessment would award 8/8, which would bring the tool score to 90/100. However, per QS Tool-First protocol, I report the tool score (82) and note that the true score with market position correctly assessed would be ~88-90. I do NOT adjust upward because the insider ownership haircut (-2) and the market position gap (+8) net to +6, and adjustments >5 require quantitative evidence. The tool score of 82 already places GAW firmly in Tier A, so the adjustment direction does not change the tier or the analysis.

## Business Understanding

### What is Games Workshop?

Games Workshop is a Nottingham, UK-headquartered company that designs, manufactures, and sells fantasy miniature figurines, primarily under the Warhammer and Warhammer 40,000 brands. The company operates an integrated ecosystem:

1. **Miniatures**: Plastic model kits sold through own stores, independent retailers ("trade"), and online. Customers assemble, paint, and play tabletop wargames. This is the core business (~85-91% of revenue).
2. **Licensing**: Third parties create video games (Space Marine 2 sold 7M+ copies), books, comics, and merchandise using Warhammer IP. Amazon has exclusive rights for films/TV series (Henry Cavill attached, expected 2027-2028). This segment is high-margin (~90% operating margin) but lumpy (~9-16% of revenue).
3. **Paints & Accessories**: Citadel paint range and hobby tools sold alongside miniatures.

The product is a **"nice-to-have"** discretionary hobby, but once a customer enters the Warhammer ecosystem, the switching costs are extremely high. A typical hobbyist invests $2,000-5,000+ in miniatures, paints, and rulebooks over time. The community element (tournaments, store events, online forums) creates social lock-in.

### Revenue Model

| Channel | Estimated % | Characteristics |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Trade (independent retailers) | ~55% | Wholesale, lower margin but scale |
| Retail (own stores) | ~20% | 570 stores globally, experiential |
| Online | ~25% | Direct, highest margin |
| Licensing | ~9-16% | Lumpy, 90%+ operating margin |

Revenue is split between **consumables** (hobby supplies, new releases drive repeat purchase) and **one-time** (initial army purchase). The "new edition" cycle (rules refreshes every 3-4 years) drives product refreshes. Games Workshop releases new products continuously (the "Warhammer treadmill") which drives repeat spend from the installed base.

### Unit Economics

- **CAC**: Low. Retail stores function as "experience centers" -- customers try painting/gaming for free, then buy kits. Community builds organically through word-of-mouth, YouTube/Twitch content creators, and now the Amazon TV show will be a massive awareness driver.
- **LTV**: Very high. A committed hobbyist spends $500-1,000+ per year for 5-20+ years. Many hobbyists remain in the ecosystem for decades.
- **LTV/CAC**: Estimated >10x (exceptional). The hobby is highly addictive.
- **Payback period**: <6 months for store-recruited customers.

### Margin Structure

```
Gross Margin:     72.1% (FY2025) -- expanding from 69.3% (FY2022)
Operating Margin: 42.3% (FY2025) -- expanding from 37.9% (FY2022)
FCF Margin:       33.4% (FY2025) -- consistent >20%
vs Sector Median: GM +37.1pp above Consumer Cyclical sector (35.0%)
Trend: EXPANDING over 4 years
```

### Capital Intensity: Asset-Light-to-Medium

- Capex is primarily molds for new miniature designs and retail store fit-outs
- Manufacturing is in-house (UK primarily, with some international) providing quality control
- Working capital is manageable; inventory turns are reasonable for specialty manufacturing
- Capex/Revenue estimated at ~8-10%

## Why Is It NOT Cheap (Valuation Context)

GAW.L is NOT a classic "why is it cheap" situation. This is a **premium-priced quality compounder** trading near all-time highs. The stock trades at:

- **P/E 26.5x** vs 5-year range of roughly 18-30x
- **Price: 16,550 GBp** vs 52-week range 12,250-19,970 GBp
- Currently at ~83% of 52-week high

**Market Narrative**: The market correctly recognizes Games Workshop as an exceptional business. The P/E has re-rated upward over the past 5 years as:
1. Space Marine 2 video game was a massive success (7M+ copies)
2. Amazon TV deal creates a long-tail IP monetization narrative (like Marvel for Disney pre-MCU)
3. Revenue growth has accelerated from ~5% to 14%+ CAGR
4. Margins have expanded significantly

**My Assessment**: The market is RIGHT that this is a phenomenal business. But at 26.5x P/E, the market is pricing in sustained high growth + successful Amazon show execution + no margin compression from tariffs. There is very little margin of safety at current prices.

### Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | SI/NO | Comment |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Industria en declive secular | NO | Tabletop gaming growing ~7-10% CAGR |
| Disrupcion tecnologica inminente | PARTIAL | 3D printing is a slow-burn threat (see risks) |
| Management destruyendo valor | NO | Kevin Rountree has excellent track record |
| Balance deteriorandose | NO | Net cash, improving |
| Insider selling masivo | NO | No material insider selling |
| Dividend cut reciente/probable | NO | Dividend growing consistently (520p FY2025 vs 420p FY2024) |
| Perdida market share | NO | Dominant and growing |
| ROIC < WACC ultimos 3 anos | NO | ROIC 63-106% vs WACC 10% |
| FCF negativo >2 anos | NO | FCF positive every year, growing |
| Goodwill >50% equity | NO | Minimal goodwill |

**TOTAL: 0.5/10 factors** (partial on 3D printing) -- Very low value trap risk.

### My Informational Advantage

- [x] Horizonte temporal mas largo -- Amazon TV show is 2027-2028, market may be impatient
- [ ] Entiendo el negocio mejor -- Market understands this well
- [ ] Mercado sobre-reacciona -- Not applicable, stock is expensive not cheap
- [x] Analisis cuantitativo diferenciado -- OEY analysis + Reverse DCF give clarity on implied growth
- [ ] Ninguna clara -- N/A

**Honest assessment**: My advantage here is patience. I can wait for a pullback (earnings miss, market correction, Amazon show delay) to buy at a fair price. The business quality is NOT in question.

---

## Moat Assessment: WIDE

GAW has one of the strongest moats I have analyzed in this portfolio:

### 1. IP Ownership and Control (Primary Moat)
- **30+ years of lore**: Warhammer and Warhammer 40,000 are among the deepest, richest fictional universes ever created. Hundreds of novels, codexes, and sourcebooks.
- **Legal enforcement**: GW aggressively protects IP (sued 3D printing sites, enforces creator guidelines)
- **No substitute**: You cannot play official Warhammer without GW miniatures. Third-party alternatives exist but are not tournament-legal.

### 2. Switching Costs (Very High)
- **Sunk cost**: A typical Warhammer army costs $500-3,000+ to build and paint. Players have invested hundreds of hours. Switching to another game system means abandoning this investment.
- **Social network**: Players' friends play Warhammer. Tournaments use Warhammer rules. Switching means leaving your gaming group.
- **Learning investment**: Rules, lore, painting techniques are all Warhammer-specific.

### 3. Network Effects (Strong)
- **Two-sided network**: More players attract more players. Local gaming communities form around Warhammer. 570 retail stores are community hubs.
- **Content ecosystem**: YouTube painting tutorials, Twitch battle reports, Reddit communities, podcasts -- all Warhammer-focused. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle.

### 4. Vertical Integration
- **In-house manufacturing**: GW controls the entire value chain from design to injection molding to distribution. This provides margin protection and quality control.
- **Design capability**: Hundreds of sculptors and designers create unique products that competitors cannot replicate at scale.

### 5. Pricing Power (Strong)
- GW has raised prices ~4-5% annually for at least 3 consecutive years without material customer loss
- GM has expanded during this period (69.3% to 72.1%), proving customers absorb price increases
- Inelastic demand: hobbyists need the specific kits for their armies

### Moat Durability: 8/10

The moat is extremely durable with one emerging risk: 3D printing. Resin 3D printers can now produce miniatures of comparable quality to GW's plastics at a fraction of the cost. However, 3D printing primarily threatens the "proxy" segment (players who use non-GW models). For tournament play and the official hobby experience, GW miniatures remain required. The Amazon TV show, if successful, could dramatically expand the addressable market and strengthen the IP moat further.

## Projection Framework

### TAM Analysis

The global tabletop gaming market has varying estimates:
- Conservative: $18.5B (2025) growing to $28B by 2031 (~7.1% CAGR)
- Moderate: $29.4B (2024) growing to $78.4B by 2034 (~10.2% CAGR)
- Warhammer-specific TAM: Miniature wargaming is a sub-segment, estimated at ~$3-5B globally

**My estimate**: The relevant TAM for Games Workshop is ~$3-5B (miniature wargaming + adjacent hobby). Growing at ~6-8% CAGR driven by:
- Growing disposable incomes in developed markets
- Social media driving hobby engagement (YouTube, TikTok painting videos)
- Amazon TV show expanding awareness to mainstream audiences
- Geographic expansion (Asia, Latin America underrepresented)

### Market Share

- **Current position**: GAW is #1 with estimated 60-70%+ share of tabletop miniature wargaming
- **Trend**: GAINING -- primary competitor Privateer Press sold Warmachine IP in 2024; Star Wars Legion/Marvel Crisis Protocol are niche alternatives
- **5-year projection**: Stable to slightly growing share as Amazon show drives new entrants to the hobby

### Pricing Power

- **Historical**: ~4-5% annual price increases consistently implemented
- **Assessment**: STRONG -- can raise prices above inflation without losing customers
- **Projection**: +3-4% annual (slightly conservative as tariff-driven increases may face pushback)

### Revenue Growth Derivation

```
Revenue Growth = TAM Growth + Market Share Delta + Pricing
               = 6% + 0-1% + 3-4%
               = ~9-11% base case

Licensing optionality:
- Amazon TV show (2027-2028) could add significant licensing revenue if successful
- Video game licensing is lumpy but growing
- H1 FY2026 licensing DOWN 47% (£16M vs £30.1M) due to Space Marine 2 being prior year comp
- Normalize licensing at ~£30-40M/year (volatile)
```

### Margin Projection

```
Gross Margin Actual: 72.1% (FY2025)
Gross Margin H1 FY2026: ~67% core (slightly compressed, may reflect tariffs/mix)
Operating Margin: 42.3% (FY2025), 39.9% (H1 FY2026 total)

Tariff impact: GW guided ~GBP 12M reduction in FY2026 profits (~2% margin impact)
Manufacturing is UK-based, so tariff exposure is on raw materials (plastic, resin) not finished goods
Offset: Price increases + volume growth

Projection:
- GM: 68-72% (stable, slight tariff compression offset by pricing)
- Operating Margin: 38-42% (stable, investment in stores + Amazon show support offset by leverage)
- FCF Margin: 28-33% (growing with operating leverage)
```

### WACC Derivation

```
Risk-Free Rate (10Y UK Gilt): 4.3%
Equity Risk Premium: 5.0% (UK market)
Beta: 1.04 (from yfinance)
Ke = 4.3% + 1.04 * 5.0% = 9.5%

Cost of Debt: 2.8% (from tool)
Tax Rate: 25.4%
Kd after-tax = 2.8% * (1 - 0.254) = 2.1%

Capital Structure:
Market Cap: ~GBP 5.5B
Total Debt: GBP 50M
E/V: 99.1%
D/V: 0.9%

WACC = (99.1% * 9.5%) + (0.9% * 2.1%) = 9.4% + 0.02% = ~9.5%

Sanity check: 9.5% for a UK mid-cap consumer discretionary company with
beta 1.04 seems appropriate. Not a utility (would be lower) nor a high-risk
emerging market (would be higher). Rounded to 10% for conservatism given
niche market risk.
```

## Valuation (Tier A: OEY Primary + Reverse DCF Secondary)

### Method 1: Owner Earnings Yield (60% weight)

```
FCF (FY2025): GBP 206M
Depreciation: ~GBP 25M (estimated from operating costs)
Maintenance Capex: ~GBP 27.5M (Depreciation * 1.1)

Owner Earnings = FCF - Maintenance Capex + Depreciation
              = 206M - 27.5M + 25M = ~GBP 203.5M

Market Cap: GBP 5,500M (at 16,550 GBp)
OEY = 203.5M / 5,500M = 3.7%

Expected Growth: 10% (base case from projection framework)
OEY + Growth = 3.7% + 10% = 13.7%

vs WACC 10% --> Spread +3.7pp (POSITIVE but not exceptional)

Interpretation:
At current price, buying GAW yields 3.7% in owner earnings + 10% growth.
Total expected return ~13.7% exceeds WACC but spread is modest.
For comparison, precedents in decisions_log show OEY+Growth >14% for BUY decisions.
At this spread, the stock is FAIRLY VALUED to SLIGHTLY EXPENSIVE.
```

**OEY-implied Fair Value**: To achieve OEY+Growth = 15% (more attractive spread):
```
Required OEY = 15% - 10% = 5%
Fair Market Cap = 203.5M / 0.05 = GBP 4,070M
Fair Price/Share = 4,070M / 33M shares = ~12,333 GBp
```

### Method 2: Reverse DCF (40% weight)

From DCF tool runs with WACC 10%, Terminal 2.5%:

| Assumed Growth | DCF Fair Value (Base) | MoS at 16,550 GBp |
|----------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
| 8% | 11,117 GBp | -32.7% (overvalued) |
| 10% | 12,032 GBp | -27.2% (overvalued) |
| 12% | 13,012 GBp | -21.3% (overvalued) |
| 14% | 14,060 GBp | -14.9% (overvalued) |

The market is currently pricing in ~16-17% FCF growth for 5 years at WACC 10%.

**Is 16-17% growth achievable?** Historically, FCF has grown faster than revenue due to margin expansion:
- FCF CAGR (FY2022-FY2025): ~32% (driven by margin expansion + revenue growth)
- Revenue CAGR: 14.2%
- The gap between FCF and revenue CAGR will likely narrow as margins stabilize

**My assessment**: 16-17% FCF growth is achievable near-term but NOT sustainable for 5 years. A more sustainable rate is 10-12% (revenue growth 9-11% + modest margin expansion).

**Reverse DCF Verdict**: At 16,550 GBp, the market is pricing in growth acceleration that assumes the Amazon TV show is a material revenue driver AND margins continue expanding. This leaves no room for error.

### Sensitivity Assessment (from DCF tool)

```
Terminal Value as % of EV: 73.2%
FV Spread: 67%
Assessment: HIGH SENSITIVITY -- DCF is unreliable as a point estimate.
Use range only.
```

### Fair Value Reconciliation

| Method | Fair Value | Weight | Weighted |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| OEY-implied (5% OEY target) | 12,333 GBp | 60% | 7,400 GBp |
| Reverse DCF (10% growth base) | 12,032 GBp | 40% | 4,813 GBp |
| **Weighted Average** | | 100% | **12,213 GBp** |

Also cross-checking with P/E-based valuation:
```
EPS FY2025: 595 GBp
Normalized P/E for quality compounder with 10-12% growth: 20-22x
Fair Value P/E method: 595 * 21 = 12,495 GBp
```

All three methods converge around **12,000-12,500 GBp**.

**Price (16,550 GBp) vs Fair Value (12,200 GBp) = MoS of -26.3% (OVERVALUED)**

## Scenarios

### Bear Case (25% prob): Amazon Show Disappoints + Tariff Margin Compression

```
Assumptions:
- Revenue growth decelerates to 6% (TAM only, no share gain, muted pricing)
- Amazon show delayed or poorly received --> licensing revenue flat at GBP 30M/yr
- Operating margin compresses to 36% (tariffs + store investment)
- WACC: 11% (risk premium increase for niche market)
- Terminal growth: 2%

Fair Value Bear: ~9,100 GBp (from DCF tool 8%/11% scenario = 8,926 GBp, rounded)
```

### Base Case (50% prob): Steady Execution + Amazon Show is Decent

```
Assumptions:
- Revenue growth 10% (TAM 6% + share stable + pricing 4%)
- Amazon show launches 2027-2028, modestly successful
- Licensing normalizes at GBP 35-40M/year
- Operating margin 39-41%
- WACC: 10%
- Terminal growth: 2.5%

Fair Value Base: ~12,200 GBp (reconciled from 3 methods)
```

### Bull Case (25% prob): Amazon Show is a Hit + Geographic Expansion

```
Assumptions:
- Revenue growth accelerates to 14-15% (Amazon show drives new customers globally)
- Licensing revenue grows to GBP 80-100M/yr (comparable to franchise IP deals)
- Operating margin expands to 44% (licensing mix + volume leverage)
- WACC: 9% (reduced risk with diversified IP monetization)
- Terminal growth: 3%

Fair Value Bull: ~17,600 GBp (from DCF 14%/9.5% scenario)
```

### Expected Value

```
EV = (Bear * 25%) + (Base * 50%) + (Bull * 25%)
   = (9,100 * 0.25) + (12,200 * 0.50) + (17,600 * 0.25)
   = 2,275 + 6,100 + 4,400
   = 12,775 GBp

Price: 16,550 GBp
MoS vs EV: -22.8% (overvalued)
MoS vs Bear: -45.0% (significantly overvalued)
```

---

## MoS Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| vs Base Fair Value | -26.3% |
| vs Expected Value | -22.8% |
| vs Bear Case | -45.0% |
| Typical MoS for Tier A (precedents) | 10-15% minimum, 30%+ exceptional |
| Current MoS | **NEGATIVE -- DO NOT BUY** |

**Reasoning**: Even though GAW is Tier A quality (QS 80-82), the current price offers zero margin of safety. Precedents show we buy Tier A compounders at MoS 29-38% (ADBE 31%, NVO 38%, LULU 34%, AUTO.L 29%, BYIT.L 35%). At -26% MoS, GAW.L fails this test decisively.

### Entry Price Calculation

To achieve MoS ~25% (consistent with Tier A precedents):
```
Entry = Fair Value * (1 - MoS)
      = 12,200 * (1 - 0.25)
      = 9,150 GBp --> too aggressive, unlikely to reach

More realistic entry for MoS ~15% (minimum for Tier A):
Entry = 12,200 * (1 - 0.15)
      = 10,370 GBp --> significant pullback needed

Pragmatic entry (MoS ~10%, acknowledging premium quality):
Entry = 12,200 * (1 - 0.10)
      = 10,980 GBp --> requires ~34% decline

Most realistic entry scenario: a 25-30% correction from current levels:
Entry zone: 12,000-13,000 GBp
```

This would require a catalyst such as: an earnings miss, Amazon show cancellation/delay, broader market correction, or tariff-driven margin compression. The 52-week low is 12,250 GBp (June 2025), so this zone has been reached within the past 12 months.

---

## Kill Conditions

1. **Gross Margin falls below 60% for 2 consecutive periods**: Would indicate structural pricing power erosion, likely from 3D printing disruption or competitive pressure.
2. **3D printing enables tournament-legal proxies at scale**: If GW loses the ability to enforce "official miniatures only" at tournaments and organized play, the moat erodes materially.
3. **Amazon deal cancelled or show rated below 6.0/10 on major platforms**: The bull case incorporates Amazon show success; failure would compress the stock and remove the licensing upside.
4. **Core revenue declines YoY for 2 consecutive half-years**: Would signal secular hobby decline rather than cyclical weakness.
5. **Management capital allocation deterioration**: Large, debt-funded acquisitions outside core competency, or dividend cut, would signal strategic shift away from the capital-light model.

---

## Macro Fit

| Factor | Sensitivity | Current Impact |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Interest rates | Low | Net cash, no refinancing risk |
| Recession | Medium | Discretionary hobby, but committed hobbyists maintain spend |
| Inflation | Low-Medium | Strong pricing power absorbs input cost inflation |
| USD/GBP | Medium | ~50% revenue non-UK; GBP weakness helps, strength hurts |
| Tariffs | Low-Medium | UK-manufactured, ~GBP 12M profit impact guided for FY2026 |
| Consumer confidence | Medium | New entrants to hobby correlate with confidence; existing base is sticky |

**World View Connection**: UK economy weak (BoE 3.75%, GDP 1.4%), but GAW is a GLOBAL business with only ~35% UK revenue. US and international growth drivers dominate. The USD weakness (DXY ~96.8) is slightly negative for GBP-reported international revenue but not material. GAW is relatively macro-insensitive due to the niche, passionate customer base.

---

## Verdict: WATCHLIST

**Rationale**: Games Workshop is one of the highest-quality businesses I have analyzed -- perfect financial quality score (40/40), ROIC 100%+, net cash, expanding margins, and a WIDE moat with 30+ years of IP. It clearly qualifies as a Quality Compounder (Tier A). However, at 16,550 GBp, the stock is 26-28% OVERVALUED relative to fair value, offering negative margin of safety.

**Action**: Add to quality universe and watchlist with entry trigger at 12,000-13,000 GBp (MoS 5-15%). Monitor for:
- Broader market correction dragging price down
- Earnings miss (licensing revenue comp from Space Marine 2 creates tough comparisons in FY2026)
- Amazon show delay announcement
- Any tariff-driven margin compression beyond guidance

**Precedent consistency**: This is consistent with the quality-compounders skill guidance: "Near all-time highs sin catalizador: El mercado ya reconoce la calidad" -- do NOT buy.

**Principio 9 (Quality Gravitation)**: GAW.L absolutely qualifies for the portfolio if price corrects. It would be among the highest-quality positions alongside ADBE and LULU. But Principio 5 (QS as input) means QS alone does not justify buying at any price.

## META-REFLECTION

### Incertidumbres/Dudas

1. **Insider ownership data (0.6%)**: yfinance may understate this. Kevin Rountree (CEO) owns shares but the exact percentage is unclear. The 2025 annual report shows total board holdings; 0.6% seems low but may be accurate given 92% institutional ownership. This slightly reduces my conviction in management alignment but the profit share scheme (GBP 20M distributed to all staff) partially compensates.

2. **3D printing long-term impact**: I assessed this as a slow-burn threat, not imminent. But the pace of consumer 3D printer improvement is accelerating. If a $300 printer can produce GW-quality miniatures by 2028-2030, the moat weakens more than I've modeled. I've accounted for this in the bear case but the probability may be higher than 25%.

3. **Amazon TV show valuation**: I've kept the Amazon show as "bull case optionality" rather than base case value. If the show becomes a Marvel-level franchise, fair value could be significantly higher (20,000+ GBp). But per critical-thinking skill, "blockbusters futuros: 80% fallan, haircut 70%" -- I should not bank on this.

4. **H1 FY2026 gross margin compression**: Core gross margin declined from 69.4% to 67.5% in H1 FY2025/26. This could be temporary (tariff impact, product mix) or the start of a trend. Worth monitoring.

### Sugerencias de Mejora

1. **Sector view gap**: GAW.L does not fit cleanly into the existing consumer-discretionary sector view, which focuses on athleisure/retail. A "gaming/entertainment/IP" sector view would better capture GAW, along with companies like Hasbro, Mattel, and entertainment IP businesses. SUGGEST: Create a new sector view or sub-section.

2. **Licensing revenue modeling**: The DCF tool treats all FCF as fungible, but GAW's licensing revenue is 90%+ margin and highly volatile. A SOTP approach separating core (physical products) from licensing (IP monetization) would be more accurate. The core business alone may be worth 10,000-11,000 GBp, with licensing adding 1,500-3,000 GBp of optionality.

### Anomalias Detectadas

1. **ROIC 105.5%**: This is extraordinarily high even for asset-light businesses. It likely reflects low invested capital (net cash, minimal fixed assets relative to earnings). The ROIC is real but may be partially a function of the balance sheet structure rather than pure economic returns. ROE of 69.8% is a more conservative measure and still exceptional.

2. **Payout ratio 89.7%**: Very high payout for a "growth" company. GAW generates so much cash that it can fund growth capex AND return 90% of earnings. This is actually a sign of business quality, not financial stress. But it means there is limited retained earnings compounding -- growth is funded by the business itself, not by balance sheet expansion.

1. Should I create a separate sector view for GAW.L (e.g., "gaming-entertainment" or "IP-driven-entertainment")? It does not fit the existing consumer-discretionary view which focuses on athleisure.

2. Given the negative MoS (-26%), should I add GAW.L to the quality_universe with an entry price of 12,000-13,000 GBp, or wait for a more specific catalyst before adding?

3. The 52-week low was 12,250 GBp (8 months ago). Is there a fundamental catalyst that could drive the stock back to that level, or is the re-rating structural (Amazon deal)?
