## TL;DR

AutoTrader Group is the dominant online car classifieds platform in the UK with 75%+ of all automotive classified minutes and 10x larger than its nearest competitor. Quality Score 79/100 (Tier A) driven by exceptional financials: 50% FCF margin, near-zero debt, 38% ROIC spread, and 62% operating margin. The stock has fallen 47% from its 52-week high of 920p to 486p, driven by dealer backlash over the mandatory Deal Builder rollout and multiple compression from a P/E of ~28x to ~15x. The business fundamentals remain intact: revenue growing 5-7%, ARPR rising 5% annually, and the UK car market recovering toward pre-pandemic levels. At current prices, Owner Earnings Yield + Growth provides an attractive spread vs WACC. **BUY with MoS 28-40% depending on scenario.**

## Quality Score: 79/100 - TIER A

### Quality Score Breakdown

| Categoria | Puntos | Maximo | Detalle |
|-----------|--------|--------|---------|
| **Financial Quality** | 39 | 40 | ROIC 38%+, FCF Margin 50%, Near Net Cash, 4/5 FCF+ |
| **Growth Quality** | 13 | 25 | Rev CAGR ~7%, EPS CAGR ~8%, GM Stable |
| **Moat Evidence** | 22 | 25 | #1 UK auto classifieds by 10x, GM +29pp vs sector |
| **Capital Allocation** | 5 | 10 | 10+ years dividends, low insider ownership (0.5%) |
| **TOTAL** | **79** | **100** | **TIER A - Quality Compounder** |

### Detalle por Componente

**Financial Quality (39/40):**
- ROIC Spread: ~38% ROIC vs ~8-9% WACC = +29-30pp spread (15 pts)
- FCF Margin: 50% = exceptional, among the best of any listed company (10 pts)
- Leverage: 0.1x Net Debt/EBITDA = essentially net cash (10 pts)
- FCF Consistency: 4/5 years positive (4 pts) - one year anomaly likely COVID-related

**Growth Quality (13/25):**
- Revenue CAGR 5yr: ~7% (5 pts) - moderate but consistent
- EPS CAGR 5yr: ~8% (5 pts) - enhanced by buybacks
- Gross Margin Trend: Stable (3 pts)

**Moat Evidence (22/25):**
- Gross Margin Premium: ~79% GM vs ~50% Communication Services median = +29pp (10 pts)
- Market Position: #1 in UK auto classifieds, undisputed (tool scored 5 pts conservatively; I assess 8 pts as #1 by huge margin - 10x nearest competitor)
- ROIC Persistence: ROIC has been well above WACC for 10+ years since IPO (7 pts)

**Capital Allocation (5/10):**
- Shareholder Returns: 10+ years of dividends + ongoing buyback program (5 pts)
- Insider Ownership: ~0.5% - low institutional/management ownership (0 pts)

**Comparison with MONY.L (QS 81, also UK platform):**
- AUTO.L has higher FCF margin (50% vs 23%) and wider ROIC spread
- MONY.L has better insider ownership (10.5% vs 0.5%) and stronger capital allocation
- Both are UK-dominant platform businesses with pricing power
- AUTO.L's moat is arguably stronger: 75%+ market share vs MONY's #2 position

## Business Understanding

### What AutoTrader Does

AutoTrader Group operates the UK's leading digital automotive marketplace. The platform connects car buyers with dealers and private sellers. It is essentially the "Rightmove of cars" - a dominant digital classifieds platform with massive network effects.

**Problem it solves:** Car buyers need a comprehensive, trusted marketplace to search inventory, compare prices, and initiate purchases. Dealers need the most eyeballs to sell their stock quickly.

**This is a "must-have" for dealers:** With 75% of all automotive classified minutes on AutoTrader, dealers cannot afford not to advertise on the platform. This creates enormous pricing power.

### Revenue Model

| Segment | % Revenue | Model | Growth Driver |
|---------|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Retailer** | ~80% | Subscription (monthly packages) | ARPR pricing + new products |
| **Consumer Services** | ~10% | Transaction/ads | Part-exchange, finance referrals |
| **Manufacturer/Agency** | ~10% | Display advertising | New car launches, branding |

**Revenue characteristics:**
- ~90% recurring/subscription-based (dealer packages)
- ARPR (Average Revenue Per Retailer) = GBP 2,994/month (H1 2026)
- ~13,500 retailer forecourts on platform
- Annual price increases implemented each April

### Unit Economics

```
ARPR (Average Revenue Per Retailer): GBP 2,994/month = GBP 35,928/year
Number of Retailer Forecourts: ~13,500
Retailer Revenue: ~GBP 480M (FY2025)

Customer Acquisition Cost: Near zero (dealers come to AutoTrader because buyers are there)
Churn: Very low (dealers cannot afford to leave the dominant platform)
LTV/CAC: Effectively infinite for core dealer base

Platform Metrics:
- ~982M visits in 2025 (nearly 1 billion)
- 32 site visits per second
- 75%+ of all automotive classified minutes
```

The LTV/CAC ratio is exceptional because the business exhibits classic marketplace network effects: buyers go where the inventory is, dealers go where the buyers are. AutoTrader won this chicken-and-egg problem decisively years ago.

### Margin Structure

```
Gross Margin:     ~79% (vs ~50% sector median = +29pp premium)
Operating Margin: ~62-63% (core Auto Trader business: 70%)
Net Margin:       ~47-48%
FCF Margin:       ~50%

Trend 5 years: STABLE to slightly EXPANDING
```

This margin profile is extraordinary. Only a handful of listed companies globally achieve 50%+ FCF margins. The business model is almost pure software/marketplace with minimal COGS.

### Capital Requirements

| Type | Capex % Rev | Working Capital | Category |
|------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| Ultra-light | ~2.5% (GBP 15M on GBP 600M rev) | Negative WC (cash generative) | Asset-light |

- Maintenance capex is minimal (servers, platform maintenance)
- Growth capex is also minimal (product development, AI features)
- Working capital is negative: AutoTrader collects from dealers before needing to pay suppliers
- FCF conversion from net income is very high (~100%)

## Por Que Esta Barata

### Price History

- 52-week high: 920p (May 2025)
- Current price: 486p
- Decline: -47% from high, -16% from 52w low of 473p (close to trough)

### Narrativa del Mercado

The market believes:

1. **[X] Deal Builder backlash threatens ARPR growth** - AutoTrader mandated adoption of Deal Builder (online transaction tool) in November 2025, causing dealer revolt. 165 dealers cancelled contracts, 70% of surveyed dealers reduced/downgraded packages.

2. **[X] Pricing power exhaustion** - After years of above-inflation price increases, dealers are pushing back. ARPR grew 5% in H1 2026 but the narrative is this growth rate will decelerate as dealers refuse to pay more.

3. **[X] Multiple compression was overdue** - Stock traded at P/E ~28x at 920p, which was expensive for a 5-7% grower. The derating to ~15x is a normalization, not an anomaly.

4. **[ ] UK car market weakness** - Some concern about macro, but the used car market actually grew 2% in 2025 and is forecast at +3% for 2026.

### Mi Contra-Tesis

**Mercado cree: Deal Builder will cause mass dealer defections**
**Yo creo:** Dealer backlash is cyclical, not structural. AutoTrader is 10x larger than any competitor. Where would dealers go? The same pattern happens with Rightmove in property - agents complain about pricing every year, threaten boycotts, then stay because they need the platform. The 165 cancellations out of ~13,500 forecourts is ~1.2% - noise, not signal.
**Mi evidencia:** ARPR still grew 5% in H1 2026 DESPITE the controversy. Revenue grew 5%. Operating profit grew 6%. The financial results contradict the bear narrative.
**Prob I'm wrong:** 15% - Risk that dealer revolt accelerates materially

**Mercado cree: Pricing power is exhausted**
**Yo creo:** AutoTrader adds GBP 90-100/month pricing and GBP 70-80/month product value at each annual event. This is a ~5-6% annual ARPR growth rate. For a monopoly platform that delivers measurable ROI to dealers (speed of sale, buyer traffic), this is sustainable indefinitely. CEO Nathan Coe admitted "we know we are not cheap" but also "the best product isn't always the cheapest" - this is monopoly behavior.
**Mi evidencia:** ARPR has grown every single year since IPO. Dealer count is stable to growing (+1% in H1 2026).
**Prob I'm wrong:** 10% - Only if a viable alternative emerges

**Mercado cree: P/E compression is permanent repricing**
**Yo creo:** The derating from 28x to 15x overshoots on the downside. AutoTrader's structural characteristics (50% FCF margin, monopoly, recurring revenue) deserve a premium multiple vs. FTSE 100 average of ~14x. Rightmove (similar UK property classifieds monopoly) trades at 17x despite similar growth. Scout24 trades at ~16x EV/EBITDA. The current 12x EV/EBITDA for AUTO.L is a discount to all peers.
**Mi evidencia:** Every peer classifieds platform trades at a premium to AUTO.L's current multiple.
**Prob I'm wrong:** 20% - If growth decelerates to <3%

### Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | SI/NO | Comentario |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Industria en declive secular | NO | UK car market growing to pre-pandemic levels by 2026 |
| Disrupcion tecnologica inminente | NO | AI enhances (not threatens) classifieds platforms |
| Management destruyendo valor | NO | Consistent shareholder returns, disciplined M&A |
| Balance deteriorandose | NO | Net cash position, low capex |
| Insider selling masivo | NO | No evidence of material insider selling |
| Dividend cut reciente/probable | NO | Dividend growing, payout ratio comfortable |
| Perdida market share | NO | Still 75%+ of automotive minutes, 10x nearest competitor |
| ROIC < WACC ultimos 3 anos | NO | ROIC 38%+ vs WACC ~9% - massive spread |
| FCF negativo >2 anos | NO | FCF ~GBP 300M, FCF margin 50% |
| Goodwill >50% equity | MAYBE | Legacy of past acquisitions, but irrelevant for asset-light platform |

**TOTAL: 0-1/10 factors SI** - Very low value trap risk. This is a genuine quality business on sale.

### Mi Ventaja Informacional

- [X] Horizonte temporal mas largo - Market is pricing near-term dealer revolt, not long-term monopoly economics
- [X] Mercado sobre-reacciona - 47% decline for a 1.2% dealer cancellation rate
- [X] Entiendo el negocio mejor - Platform economics create winner-take-all dynamics that make boycotts structurally impossible

## Projections (Derived from Business Logic)

### TAM Analysis

```
TAM: UK automotive marketplace
UK car transactions: ~10M/year (2026 forecast, returning to pre-pandemic levels)
  - Used: ~8M transactions
  - New: ~2M registrations

TAM Growth Rate: 2-3% per year
  - Drivers: population growth, fleet replacement cycle, electrification
  - Headwinds: car sharing, public transport investment (minor)

AutoTrader penetration: ~80-85% of UK dealers advertise on platform
  - Implies some room for dealer count growth, but primary growth lever is ARPR
```

### Revenue Growth Derivation

```
Revenue Growth = Dealer count growth + ARPR growth + Consumer/Manufacturer growth

Dealer count: +1% per year (H1 2026 trend)
ARPR growth: +5% per year (combination of pricing +3% and product upsell +2%)
Consumer services: +10% per year (small base, expanding into finance/insurance referrals)

Total Revenue Growth = ~6-7% per year (base case)

Bear case: 3-4% (ARPR growth slows to 2-3%, dealer count flat)
Bull case: 8-10% (ARPR growth accelerates to 7%+, new products succeed)
```

### Margin Projection

```
Gross Margin: 79% current → 79-80% projected (stable, platform model)
Operating Margin: 62% current → 62-65% projected
  - Operating leverage: revenue grows faster than fixed cost base
  - Digital Services Tax: ~GBP 10M/year drag (already in base)
FCF Margin: 50% current → 50-52% projected (capex remains minimal)
```

### WACC Derivation

```
Cost of Equity (Ke):
  Risk-Free Rate: 4.3% (UK 10Y gilt)
  Equity Risk Premium: 5.0% (mature UK market)
  Beta: 0.85 (defensive platform, lower than market - yfinance shows ~0.8-0.9)
  Ke = 4.3% + 0.85 * 5.0% = 8.55%

Cost of Debt (Kd):
  AutoTrader has near-zero net debt, so debt component is negligible
  Kd after-tax: ~3.5% (if they had debt)

Capital Structure:
  Equity weight: ~99%
  Debt weight: ~1%

WACC = (99% * 8.55%) + (1% * 3.5%) = 8.5%

Sanity check: 8.5% for a defensive, UK-based, net cash, monopoly platform business.
This is reasonable - slightly below average reflecting low risk profile.
```

### Terminal Growth

```
Terminal growth: 2.5%
  Rationale: UK GDP growth ~1.5-2%, plus AutoTrader's pricing power above inflation.
  AutoTrader can sustainably grow above GDP because:
  - Annual ARPR increases
  - Expanding product suite (finance, insurance, data services)
  - But capped at 3% max to be conservative
```

## Valuation

### Method 1 (Primary, 60%): Owner Earnings Yield

```
FCF (TTM): ~GBP 304M
Depreciation: ~GBP 12M
Maintenance Capex: ~GBP 13M (depreciation * 1.1)
Owner Earnings = GBP 304M - GBP 13M + GBP 12M = GBP 303M

Market Cap at 486p: ~GBP 4.08B
Owner Earnings Yield = GBP 303M / GBP 4.08B = 7.4%

Expected Revenue Growth: 6-7%
Expected EPS Growth: 8-10% (revenue + operating leverage + buybacks)

OEY + Growth = 7.4% + 8% = 15.4%
WACC = 8.5%
Spread = 15.4% - 8.5% = 6.9 percentage points

Precedent context (decisions_log.yaml):
- ADBE (Tier A, QS 76): OEY + Growth ~16.5%, MoS 31%
- MONY.L (Tier A, QS 81): Similar platform economics
- NVO (Tier A, QS 82): OEY + Growth calculated at purchase

AUTO.L's OEY + Growth of 15.4% is attractive and comparable to ADBE's 16.5%.
The 6.9pp spread over WACC indicates significant value creation at current price.
```

**Implied Fair Value from OEY method:**
At a target OEY of 5% (reflecting Tier A quality + growth), FV = GBP 303M / 5% = GBP 6.06B
= ~720p per share (GBP 6.06B / 842M shares)

### Method 2 (Secondary, 40%): Reverse DCF + EV/EBIT Peers

**Reverse DCF Analysis:**
Using the DCF tool with various growth rates:

| Growth Rate | WACC | Terminal | Base FV | Implied Assessment |
|-------------|------|----------|---------|-------------------|
| 5% | 10% | 2% | 514p | Conservative - implies stagnation |
| 7% | 9% | 2.5% | 680p | Base case - implies moderate growth |
| 9% | 8.5% | 3% | 864p | Optimistic - implies acceleration |

At current price of 486p, the market is pricing in ~4-5% perpetual growth with a 10% WACC.
My estimate of 6-7% growth with 8.5% WACC implies the stock is significantly undervalued.

**EV/EBIT Peer Comparison:**

| Company | Market | P/E | EV/EBITDA | Growth | Notes |
|---------|--------|-----|-----------|--------|-------|
| AutoTrader (AUTO.L) | UK Cars | 14.7x | 12.0x | 5-7% | **Current** |
| Rightmove (RMV.L) | UK Property | 17.2x | 14.1x | 3-5% | Direct UK peer |
| Scout24 (G24.DE) | DE Property/Cars | ~22x | 15.7x | 8-10% | Higher growth |
| REA Group (REA.AX) | AU Property | 43.4x | 36.9x | 15%+ | Premium growth market |

AutoTrader trades at a **discount** to every peer despite similar or better fundamentals:
- AUTO.L has the HIGHEST operating margin (62% vs Rightmove 55%)
- AUTO.L has the HIGHEST FCF margin (50% vs Rightmove ~45%)
- AUTO.L growing FASTER than Rightmove (5-7% vs 3-5%)
- Yet AUTO.L trades at a LOWER multiple (12x vs 14x EV/EBITDA)

Applying Rightmove's multiple to AUTO.L:
- AUTO.L EBITDA ~GBP 380M (annualized from H1)
- At 14x EV/EBITDA: EV = GBP 5.32B
- Less net debt GBP 40M: Equity = GBP 5.28B
- FV = 5.28B / 842M shares = **627p**

Applying a small premium for faster growth (14.5x):
- EV = GBP 5.51B, Equity = GBP 5.47B
- FV = **650p**

### Reconciliation

| Metodo | Fair Value | Peso | Weighted |
|--------|-----------|------|----------|
| Owner Earnings Yield | 720p | 60% | 432p |
| EV/EBIT Peers | 640p | 40% | 256p |
| **Weighted Average** | | 100% | **688p** |

Divergencia metodos: 12.5% - acceptable (both methods agree on significant undervaluation).

Precio actual: 486p
MoS vs Weighted FV: (688-486)/688 = **29.4%**

## Scenarios

### Bear Case (25% probability)

```
Assumptions:
- ARPR growth slows to 2-3% as dealer revolt broadens
- Dealer count declines 1-2% per year
- Revenue growth: 1-2%
- Operating margin compresses to 58% (Deal Builder costs)
- WACC: 9.5% (higher risk premium for execution uncertainty)
- Terminal growth: 2%

Fair Value Bear: ~500p (essentially flat from current)
```

The bear case requires a structural deterioration of AutoTrader's monopoly position. This is unlikely because there is no viable competitor. Even in the bear case, the stock is approximately fairly valued - meaning limited downside risk.

### Base Case (50% probability)

```
Assumptions:
- ARPR growth of 5% per year (pricing + product)
- Dealer count stable to +1%
- Revenue growth: 6-7%
- Operating margin expands to 64%
- WACC: 8.5%
- Terminal growth: 2.5%

Fair Value Base: ~680p
```

### Bull Case (25% probability)

```
Assumptions:
- Deal Builder succeeds, unlocking new transaction revenue
- ARPR growth accelerates to 7%+ (more products, data services)
- Consumer services scale (finance, insurance)
- Revenue growth: 9-10%
- Operating margin expands to 66%
- WACC: 8% (lower as business proves resilience)
- Terminal growth: 3%

Fair Value Bull: ~880p
```

### Expected Value

```
EV = (500 * 25%) + (680 * 50%) + (880 * 25%)
EV = 125 + 340 + 220
EV = 685p

Precio actual: 486p
MoS vs EV: (685-486)/685 = 29.1%
MoS vs Bear: (500-486)/500 = 2.8%
```

---

## MoS Assessment

- vs Base (680p): **29%**
- vs Expected Value (685p): **29%**
- vs Bear (500p): **3%** (limited downside)
- vs Weighted FV (688p): **29%**

**Reasoning on MoS adequacy:**
For a Tier A compounder, precedents show MoS of 31-38% at entry (ADBE 31%, MONY.L 36%, NVO 38%, LULU 34%). AUTO.L's 29% MoS is slightly below these precedents.

However, there are factors that partly compensate:
1. AUTO.L has near-zero downside risk (bear case ~flat to current price)
2. The monopoly position is arguably the strongest of any UK platform (stronger than MONY.L which is #2)
3. The 50% FCF margin provides extreme defensibility

The MoS is at the lower end of Tier A precedents but still reasonable given the quality profile. If the price drops toward 470-475p (near the 52-week low of 473p), the MoS improves to ~31%, fully in line with precedents.

**Recommendation: Set standing order at 475p for initial position. At current 486p, acceptable for a starter position.**

---

## Kill Conditions

1. **Dealer count decline >5% in a year** - Would indicate structural disintermediation of the platform
2. **ARPR growth turns negative** - Would mean pricing power is broken
3. **A credible competitor achieves >20% market share of classified minutes** - Would threaten monopoly economics
4. **FCF margin declines below 35%** - Would indicate business model degradation
5. **Management pursues large M&A (>GBP 1B)** - Would signal empire-building over compounding

## Catalizadores

| Catalizador | Timeframe | Prob | Impacto |
|-------------|-----------|------|---------|
| Deal Builder controversy fades as dealers accept | 0-6m | H (70%) | +15-20% as risk premium removed |
| FY2026 results (May 2026) showing continued growth | 3-4m | H (75%) | +10-15% if revenue/ARPR beat |
| UK car market reaches 10M transactions | 6-12m | M (60%) | +5-10% volume tailwind |
| Share buyback accelerates at depressed prices | 0-6m | H (80%) | EPS accretion |
| Potential acquisition target (Rightmove attempted) | 1-3y | L (20%) | +30-50% takeover premium |
| Multiple re-rating toward peer average (14-15x EV/EBITDA) | 6-18m | M (60%) | +20-30% |

---

## Macro Sensitivity

| Factor | Sensibilidad | Impacto Actual |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Tasas de interes | Baja | Platform business, near-zero debt |
| Recesion | Media | Used car market is counter-cyclical (people buy used instead of new) |
| Inflacion | Baja-Positiva | Pricing power lets AUTO pass through inflation |
| GBP strength | Baja | Domestic business, UK revenue only |
| UK car market | Media | Recovery to pre-pandemic levels is tailwind |

**Fit con World View:**
- UK economy stable, not in recession
- Interest rates at 4.5% BoE - neutral for AUTO (no debt sensitivity)
- Used car market recovery provides volume tailwind
- No significant tariff exposure (domestic UK business)
- Already have UK exposure (MONY.L, SHEL.L, IMB.L, TATE.L, DOM.L) but AUTO.L is uncorrelated to these (different sector/dynamics)

---

## Portfolio Context

**Current UK exposure (from portfolio):**
- SHEL.L (energy), IMB.L (staples), TATE.L (staples), DOM.L (staples), MONY.L (fintech/comparison)
- Adding AUTO.L would increase UK exposure

**Reasoning on geography:**
AUTO.L is a UK-domestic business but it is completely uncorrelated with our other UK positions:
- SHEL.L: Global energy commodity play
- IMB.L/TATE.L/DOM.L: Consumer staples
- MONY.L: Price comparison/fintech
- AUTO.L: Auto classifieds monopoly

The risk of a "UK shock" affecting ALL of these simultaneously is low because they operate in entirely different end-markets. The correlation is through GBP/EUR only.

**Precedent (decisions_log.yaml):** Geography decisions show EU at 34.1% with reasoning that country risk matters more than simple % allocation. UK developed market with stable legal system and deep capital markets = high tolerance.

**Sizing reasoning:**
Tier A precedents show 3-5% initial positions. Given:
- MoS of 29% (slightly below precedent average of ~35%)
- Strong monopoly position but Deal Builder uncertainty
- Already significant UK exposure

A starter position of 3-3.5% is appropriate. This allows room to ADD if the price drops further toward 450-475p (which would bring MoS to 30-35%, fully in line with precedents).

If starter at 486p with EUR 400-450 (~3.7-4.2% of ~EUR 10,700 portfolio):
- ~73-82 shares at 486p (EUR 5.58 per share)
- If falls 50%: portfolio impact = 1.85-2.1% = acceptable for high-conviction Tier A

---

## Veredicto: BUY

**Entry price:** 475-486p (standing order at 475p ideal, market order at 486p acceptable)
**Initial sizing:** 3-3.5% (EUR 350-400)
**ADD trigger:** Below 450p (MoS >34%)
**Full position target:** 4-5% if fundamentals confirmed at FY2026 results (May 2026)

**Rationale:**
1. Tier A compounder (QS 79) at 47% discount from peak
2. Monopoly platform with 75%+ market share, 10x nearest competitor
3. Exceptional financials: 50% FCF margin, net cash, 38% ROIC spread
4. Dealer revolt is cyclical noise, not structural threat
5. Trading at discount to ALL peers despite superior margins
6. Bear case shows limited downside (~flat to current)
7. OEY + Growth of 15.4% provides 6.9pp spread over WACC
8. MoS of 29% acceptable for Tier A given quality profile

---

## META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres

- **Deal Builder resolution timeline is uncertain.** The dealer revolt started in November 2025. If it drags through 2026, it could suppress ARPR growth below my 5% estimate. The H1 2026 results (September 2025) pre-date the worst of the backlash, so the next full-year results (May 2026) will be the true test.

- **The -47% decline is steeper than pure fundamentals justify.** This makes me wonder if there is something I am missing - perhaps institutional selling due to fund redemptions, or a broader UK mid-cap de-rating trend. The magnitude of the decline deserves humility.

- **Insider ownership at 0.5% is low.** This is a concern for a Tier A compounder - I want management to have skin in the game. The company is buying back shares, which partially compensates, but individual insider buying would be a stronger signal.

### Sugerencias de Mejora

- **Create online-classifieds/marketplaces sector view** - AUTO.L, RMV.L, and MONY.L are all related businesses. A dedicated sector view for "UK Digital Platforms/Marketplaces" would be more appropriate than putting AUTO.L under Technology.

- **Consider a "platform economics" analysis tool** - Network effects, multi-sided marketplace dynamics, and winner-take-all economics are recurring patterns in our analysis. A standardized framework for platform businesses could improve consistency.

### Anomalias Detectadas

- **Quality Scorer gave Market Position only 5 pts (manual input needed)** - The tool could not automatically determine market position. I manually assess this as #1 by a massive margin (8 pts), which would bring QS to 82 instead of 79. Either way, firmly Tier A.

- **DCF tool default scenarios (growth 5%, WACC 9%, terminal 2.5%) give Bear FV of 496p** - This means even the tool's conservative scenario shows the stock as approximately fairly valued, confirming limited downside.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator

1. **How should we handle the UK concentration question?** Adding AUTO.L would make UK our largest geographic exposure. The positions are uncorrelated operationally, but GBP is a shared risk. Should we adjust sizing downward?

2. **Should we wait for the Deal Builder controversy to resolve before buying?** The counter-argument is that by the time it resolves, the stock will have rerated. Classic "buy the fear" setup. But the uncertainty is real.

3. **Should this go under Technology sector view or should we create a new "Digital Marketplaces" sector view?** AUTO.L is classified as Communication Services, not Technology. A dedicated view might be more appropriate.
