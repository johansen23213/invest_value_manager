# Counter-Analysis: AUTO.L (AutoTrader Group plc)

## Fecha: 2026-02-09

## PROCESS NOTE: INCOMPLETE PIPELINE

Before proceeding, I note that the thesis was produced WITHOUT the full adversarial pipeline:
- NO independent moat_assessment.md exists
- NO independent risk_assessment.md exists
- NO independent valuation_report.md exists
- NO sector view for "online classifieds/digital marketplaces" exists

The thesis is the SOLE document. This means the analyst was marking their own homework -- no independent challenge was applied before the position was opened.

---

## Resumen Ejecutivo

The thesis has moderate-to-serious vulnerabilities. AutoTrader IS a quality business, but the thesis understates execution risk around the April 2026 pricing event, understates the ARPA growth deceleration trend (H2 FY2025 ARPA slowed to 3.5% from 11.7% YoY), uses OEY as primary valuation without running a DCF (violating the "minimum 2 real methods" discipline), and assigns a bear case of 500p that provides almost zero margin of safety. The 29% MoS depends entirely on the OEY method producing 720p, which itself depends on assuming 8% perpetual growth -- questionable for a 5-7% grower with decelerating ARPA. Analyst consensus FV is 725-858p vs thesis 688p, but consensus has been revised DOWN from 895p and is likely to be revised further. The position is small (3.4%) and the business quality is genuine, so the risk of permanent capital loss is limited. However, the thesis overstates certainty and understates near-term execution risk.

## Scorecard: 10 Thesis Arguments Challenged

### 1. "75%+ monopoly in UK car classifieds"

**Thesis claim:** AutoTrader has 75%+ of all automotive classified minutes and is 10x larger than its nearest competitor. This moat is unassailable.

**Counter-evidence:**
- The 75% share metric is REAL and independently verifiable. AutoTrader is indeed dominant.
- HOWEVER, the thesis ignores the "type" of competition that matters. The threat is not from Motors.co.uk or Cinch (traditional competitors). The threat is from:
  - **Facebook Marketplace**: Over 1 billion monthly users globally. Free listings. While automotive-specific data for UK is limited, Facebook Marketplace has become a major informal channel for used car sales, particularly at the lower end. Dealers don't need it, but private sellers increasingly use it, eroding AutoTrader's private seller segment.
  - **AI/ChatGPT search disruption**: Consumers are asking LLMs "what car should I buy?" BEFORE visiting AutoTrader. AJ Bell explicitly flagged this as a concern, and shares in Rightmove, AutoTrader and Baltic Classifieds have been weak partly because of AI search fears. AutoTrader Canada has integrated with ChatGPT, suggesting the company itself views this as a real risk requiring proactive defense.
  - **OEM direct-to-consumer**: Tesla (direct sales, no dealer/classifieds needed), BYD (using dealers but with its own digital platform). As EV share rises to 28%+ in 2026, more new car sales bypass traditional classifieds entirely. BYD sold 51K vehicles in UK in 2025 (up from 8.7K in 2024) -- none of these go through AutoTrader for the initial sale.
- The moat is real FOR NOW, but the thesis treats it as permanent. Monopolies in digital marketplaces CAN be disrupted -- ask MySpace, Yellow Pages, or Craigslist in certain verticals.

**Counter Strength:** MODERATE (2/3)
**Severity:** MODERATE -- The moat is real today but the thesis ignores emerging threats that could erode it over 5-10 years. Not an immediate kill condition but the "forever monopoly" framing is overconfident.

---

### 2. "50% FCF margin, 38% ROIC spread = elite quality"

**Thesis claim:** These financials are exceptional and sustainable, among the best of any listed company.

**Counter-evidence:**
- The 50% FCF margin IS genuinely exceptional. This is not disputed.
- The 38% ROIC spread IS exceptional. This is not disputed.
- HOWEVER, these metrics are achievable BECAUSE of monopoly pricing power. If that pricing power erodes (see challenges 3, 4), the margins compress.
- The ARPA growth deceleration (3.5% in H2 FY2025, down from 11.7% a year ago) is the FIRST SIGN that pricing power may be peaking. If ARPA growth turns flat or negative, revenue growth stalls entirely because there are no other meaningful growth levers (dealer count is roughly stable).
- Operating margins are 70% for core Auto Trader. There is almost no room for margin expansion. All growth must come from revenue, not efficiency.

**Counter Strength:** WEAK (1/3)
**Severity:** LOW -- The current quality is genuine. The risk is about sustainability, not current state.

---

### 3. "Deal Builder backlash is noise (1.2% cancellations)"

**Thesis claim:** 165 cancellations out of 13,500 forecourts is 1.2% -- noise, not signal. ARPR still grew 5%.

**Counter-evidence:**
- The thesis understates the scale of the backlash:
  - **3,000+ dealers** joined the Autotrader Dealers Community Facebook group to organize against the company. This is ~22% of AutoTrader's dealer base showing organized dissatisfaction.
  - A Car Dealer Magazine survey found **180 retailers cancelled or downgraded** contracts -- higher than AutoTrader's own claim of "fewer than 100."
  - **70% of surveyed dealers** reduced or downgraded packages (per the thesis's own admission in the "narrativa del mercado" section). This means the impact is not just cancellations -- it's downgrades.
  - Dealers criticized Deal Builder for "removing control from dealers and adding unnecessary work" -- this is not about price, it's about product design.
- AutoTrader was FORCED to make concessions: adding Reservation Request feature, launching Customer Advisory Groups, refining Deal Builder for 2026.
- **Jefferies downgraded from Buy to Hold (target 895p to 650p)** specifically because of Deal Builder concerns and the April 2026 pricing event uncertainty.
- The REAL test is April 2026 when the pricing event happens. Coe confirmed 5.5% price increase from April 1. If dealers revolt in greater numbers, this becomes material.

**Counter Strength:** MODERATE (2/3)
**Severity:** HIGH -- The thesis dismisses organized dealer revolt involving 22% of the dealer base as "noise." Jefferies disagrees. The April 2026 pricing event is an imminent catalyst that could validate or invalidate this assumption. The thesis was written BEFORE the April event resolution.

---

### 4. "ARPR +5% annually is sustainable pricing power"

**Thesis claim:** AutoTrader can raise ARPR by ~5-6% annually indefinitely because it's a monopoly delivering ROI to dealers.

**Counter-evidence:**
- ARPA growth has been DECELERATING sharply:
  - H2 FY2024: 11.7%
  - H1 FY2025: 6.3%
  - H2 FY2025: **3.5%**
  - H1 FY2026: 5% (but this includes the April pricing event boost)
- The H2 FY2025 figure of 3.5% is LESS THAN HALF the H1 figure and LESS THAN A THIRD of the year-ago figure. This is a clear deceleration trend.
- FY2026 retailer revenue guidance was 5-7% (vs Jefferies prior forecast of 10%) -- this was the reason for the 14% share price crash in May 2025.
- The stock lever actually DECREASED by GBP 11 in H1 2026 (vs +GBP 10 in prior year) -- meaning dealers had fewer stock units advertised, likely due to fast stock turn reducing the need for paid advertising.
- CEO Nathan Coe's own words: "we know we are not cheap." This is an admission that pricing power has limits.
- The 5% ARPR growth in H1 2026 was achieved with GBP 89 from price + GBP 64 from product (Co-Driver). The product lever growth (GBP 64 vs GBP 80 prior year) is also decelerating.

**Counter Strength:** STRONG (3/3)
**Severity:** HIGH -- Hard evidence of ARPA deceleration from 11.7% to 3.5% in 12 months. The thesis assumes indefinite 5% growth but the trend is clearly downward. If ARPA growth settles at 2-3% (inflation-like), the entire valuation model breaks.

---

### 5. "No viable competitor can emerge (10x larger)"

**Thesis claim:** AutoTrader is 10x larger than its nearest competitor. No one can challenge it.

**Counter-evidence:**
- The thesis correctly identifies the network effects. Traditional competitors (Motors.co.uk, Cinch, Cazoo) are too small.
- BUT the thesis ignores NON-TRADITIONAL competition:
  - **Facebook Marketplace**: Zero-cost alternative. No ARPR. No subscription. Dealers can list for free. While it's not a direct substitute for the full dealer experience, it diverts buyer attention and traffic.
  - **OEM platforms**: Tesla, BYD, and other EV OEMs sell directly. As EVs grow from 23% to 28%+ of new car sales (2025-2026), this segment bypasses classifieds entirely.
  - **AI-powered search**: Google, ChatGPT, and other AI platforms could disintermediate the search layer. Consumers doing "car research" may spend less time on AutoTrader and more time in AI chatbots.
- The Rightmove comparison the thesis uses is apt, BUT Rightmove was almost acquired by REA Group (GBP 5.6B offer in 2024) -- suggesting even established classifieds monopolies attract predators.
- Historical precedent: Yellow Pages was a monopoly classifieds platform. It was disrupted in a decade.

**Counter Strength:** MODERATE (2/3)
**Severity:** MODERATE -- The traditional competitive moat is real. But the thesis claims zero risk from non-traditional competitors, which is overconfident over a 3-5 year horizon.

---

### 6. "P/E 15x is cheap for monopoly quality"

**Thesis claim:** The derating from 28x to 15x overshoots on the downside. Peers trade higher.

**Counter-evidence:**
- AutoTrader's P/E of ~15x is NOT obviously cheap for a company growing revenue at 5% and EPS at 7-8%.
- **Rightmove trades at P/E 16.7x** -- only slightly higher, and Rightmove has guided for 8-10% revenue growth vs AutoTrader's 5-7%. Rightmove's premium is justified by higher growth.
- **The PEG ratio**: At P/E 15x and EPS growth of 7%, PEG = 2.1x. This is NOT cheap by value investing standards (PEG > 1.5 is expensive).
- **Analyst consensus target price ranges from 725p to 858p** -- well BELOW the thesis's 688p weighted FV. But importantly, consensus has been revised DOWN from 895p (Jefferies cut from 895 to 650).
- The 28x P/E at 920p was clearly overvalued for a 5-7% grower. The derating to 15x may be APPROPRIATE, not excessive. Many UK platform businesses trade at 12-17x.
- Scout24 (German property classifieds) trades at ~16x EV/EBITDA, but Scout24 is growing faster.

**Counter Strength:** MODERATE (2/3)
**Severity:** MODERATE -- 15x P/E is not obviously cheap for a decelerating 5-7% grower. The thesis argues it deserves a premium, but the market may be correctly pricing in ARPA deceleration and Deal Builder risk.

---

### 7. "FV 688p, MoS 29%"

**Thesis claim:** Fair value is 688p based on OEY (60%) + EV/EBIT Peers (40%). MoS is 29%.

**Counter-evidence:**
- **CRITICAL: The OEY method was used as primary (60% weight) without running a DCF.** This violates the system's own rule of "minimum 2 real methods." OEY and peer comparison are related (both depend on multiples/yield assumptions). A proper DCF would provide a genuinely independent second opinion.
- **The OEY method produced 720p by assuming 8% growth.** But where does this 8% come from? Revenue is growing 5%. EPS is growing 7-8% (enhanced by buybacks). If we use 6% (mid-range), the OEY-implied FV drops to ~630p.
- **The OEY formula: OEY + Growth = 7.4% + 8% = 15.4% vs WACC 8.5%.** This is attractive. But:
  - The 8% growth assumption is the UPPER bound of actual growth
  - The WACC of 8.5% seems low for a UK-listed company with deal builder execution risk
  - If we use 6% growth and 9.5% WACC: 7.4% + 6% = 13.4% vs 9.5% = spread of only 3.9pp
- **Peer comparison produced 627-650p** (applying Rightmove's multiple). This is 10-14% BELOW the OEY-derived 720p. The thesis averaged them but the divergence should trigger investigation (per skill rules).
- **My alternative FV estimate:**
  - Conservative OEY: FCF GBP 304M / (9.5% WACC - 5% growth) = GBP 6.76B equity value / 838M shares = 806p. But this is the perpetuity model, which is very sensitive. With 6% growth: 304M / (9.5% - 6%) = 8.7B / 838M = 1038p. And with 4% growth: 304M / (9.5% - 4%) = 5.5B / 838M = 655p. The spread from 655p to 1038p shows OEY is extremely model-dependent.
  - Conservative EV/EBIT at 12x (current multiple): FV = current price (already reflecting 12x)
  - Conservative EV/EBIT at 14x (Rightmove parity): FV = ~565p-600p
  - **Risk-adjusted bear FV: 500-550p**
  - **Risk-adjusted base FV: 580-640p**
  - **Risk-adjusted bull FV: 700-750p**

**Counter Strength:** STRONG (3/3)
**Severity:** HIGH -- The valuation relies heavily on OEY with a generous growth assumption and no DCF cross-check. The peer comparison method gives 627-650p, which suggests MoS is only 18-25% (not 29%). If we use my risk-adjusted base of 580-640p, MoS drops to 16-24%.

---

### 8. "UK car market recovering"

**Thesis claim:** UK car market growing toward pre-pandemic levels by 2026, forecast +3% for used cars.

**Counter-evidence:**
- The thesis is MOSTLY correct here. UK new car market grew 3.5% in 2025 to 2.02M units. Used car market grew 2%. The market IS recovering.
- HOWEVER, the thesis does not account for:
  - **EV depreciation impact**: EVs lose ~40% value after 1 year vs ~35% for ICE. As EV share grows, faster depreciation creates MORE used car supply, potentially REDUCING advertising duration (and thus AutoTrader revenue per dealer).
  - **Fast stock turn reducing ad spend**: AutoTrader itself noted that "constrained supply has resulted in stock growing more slowly than expected given the speed at which the vehicles are selling. This in turn leads to shorter periods of advertising, which impacts revenues." A GOOD used car market actually HURTS AutoTrader's revenue per vehicle.
  - **FCA motor finance investigation**: An overhang on the entire used car sector. The FCA is designing a compensation scheme that could distribute up to GBP 8.2B among 14M affected drivers. AutoTrader's Consumer Services revenue (finance referrals) grew 22% to GBP 15.8M -- but the FCA investigation creates uncertainty over the motor finance ecosystem that feeds this revenue.

**Counter Strength:** MODERATE (2/3)
**Severity:** MODERATE -- The market IS recovering, but paradoxically a strong used car market (fast stock turn) HURTS AutoTrader's revenue per dealer. The thesis treats market recovery as unambiguously positive when it's actually mixed.

---

### 9. "Bear case 500p = only 3% downside"

**Thesis claim:** Bear scenario at 500p with 25% probability, providing only 3% downside from 486p entry.

**Counter-evidence:**
- **A bear case 3% below entry price is NOT a real bear case.** This is a "mild correction" disguised as a bear scenario.
- If we're buying at 486p and the "worst case" is 500p, what is the risk/reward framework actually telling us? That there's essentially no downside risk? This is dangerously complacent.
- **A realistic bear case should consider:**
  - April 2026 pricing event goes badly (significant dealer revolt) + Deal Builder backlash worsens
  - ARPA growth decelerates to 1-2% (inflation-only)
  - Revenue growth slows to 3%
  - Multiple compresses to 10-12x P/E (in line with low-growth utility companies)
  - At 11x P/E on current EPS of ~32p: **bear case = 350-380p** (-22 to -28% from entry)
- The bear case should also account for the FCA finance investigation overhang and AI disruption fears.
- **The stock's 52-week low is 473p** -- it has ALREADY traded below the thesis's "bear case" of 500p.

**Counter Strength:** STRONG (3/3)
**Severity:** CRITICAL -- A bear case only 3% below entry provides essentially no margin of safety. The REAL bear case is 350-400p (-18 to -28%). This means the thesis's "expected value" calculation is skewed because the bear scenario is not bear enough.

---

### 10. "Low value trap risk (0/10)"

**Thesis claim:** Zero value trap risk factors present.

**Counter-evidence:**
- Most factors are correctly assessed as NO. AutoTrader is NOT a value trap in the traditional sense.
- HOWEVER, two factors deserve reconsideration:
  - **"Goodwill >50% equity" = MAYBE**: The thesis dismisses this as "irrelevant for asset-light platform." But goodwill IS relevant -- it represents overpayment for acquisitions. Autorama (loss-making, only just improving) was an acquisition that has destroyed value.
  - **"Management destroying value" is debatable**: The Deal Builder rollout was botched -- mandating adoption without adequate dealer consultation, causing organized revolt. This is a management execution error, even if it's ultimately recoverable.
  - **Insider ownership at 0.5% is genuinely concerning**: CEO Coe owns 0.41% (GBP 20M). For a GBP 4.1B company, this is minimal skin in the game. Contrast with BYIT.L where insiders own 9.6%.
- I would score value trap risk as 1/10 (not 0/10). Low, but not zero.

**Counter Strength:** WEAK (1/3)
**Severity:** LOW -- This is not a value trap. But 0/10 overstates certainty.

## Additional Risks NOT in Thesis

### Risk A: April 2026 Pricing Event (IMMINENT CATALYST)
- The annual pricing event (April 1, 2026) is THE binary catalyst. Coe confirmed 5.5% price increase.
- If dealers revolt in greater numbers post-Deal Builder controversy, this could trigger a wave of cancellations/downgrades.
- This risk is 52 days away from today (Feb 9). The thesis does not flag it as an imminent risk.
- **Severity: HIGH**

### Risk B: FCA Motor Finance Investigation
- The FCA is designing a compensation scheme potentially distributing GBP 8.2B. While AutoTrader is not directly a finance provider, its Consumer Services revenue (finance referrals, GBP 15.8M, growing 22%) depends on the motor finance ecosystem.
- More broadly, the FCA investigation creates regulatory uncertainty that could chill used car finance activity, impacting AutoTrader's consumer services growth.
- **Severity: MODERATE**

### Risk C: AI/Chatbot Disruption of Search Layer
- AJ Bell, analyst commentary, and the stock's weakness all cite AI as a structural concern.
- AutoTrader Canada has already integrated with ChatGPT -- defensive move.
- If AI chatbots capture the "car recommendation" layer (top-of-funnel), AutoTrader's role narrows to "inventory listing" (lower-value).
- Timeline: 2-5 years. Not immediate but strategically important.
- **Severity: MODERATE** (long-term)

### Risk D: No Sector View Created
- The thesis itself recommended creating an "online classifieds/marketplaces sector view."
- This was not done. Investment Committee should have flagged this (Gate 0 violation, per Error #42).
- Without a sector view, there is no systematic understanding of peer dynamics, competitive threats, or regulatory trends.
- **Severity: MODERATE** (process failure)

### Risk E: Revenue Growth Guidance Downgrade Pattern
- FY2025: Revenue grew 5%. Jefferies forecast had been 10% for FY2026.
- FY2026 guidance: 5-7% retailer revenue growth.
- H1 FY2026 actual: 5% revenue growth.
- Pattern: guidance being lowered, actual growth at the LOW end of guidance.
- **Severity: MODERATE**

### Risk F: Autorama Ongoing Losses
- Autorama lost GBP 1.4M in H1 2026 (improved from GBP 4.3M FY2025 and GBP 8.8M FY2024).
- While improving, this is still a capital allocation decision that has cumulatively destroyed GBP 15-20M+ in shareholder value.
- The thesis does not mention Autorama at all.
- **Severity: LOW** (improving trajectory)

## Devil's Advocate Fair Value Estimate

| Scenario | Method | Key Assumptions | FV |
|----------|--------|----------------|-----|
| Bear | 11x P/E on 32p EPS | ARPA flat, revenue stalls 3% | 350-380p |
| Conservative Base | 13x P/E on 33p EPS | ARPA 2-3%, revenue 4-5% | 430-460p |
| Base | 14x P/E on 34p EPS | ARPA 4-5%, revenue 5-6% | 480-530p |
| Optimistic | 16x P/E on 35p EPS | ARPA 5%+, revenue 7%+ | 560-600p |

**My risk-adjusted base: 480-530p** (vs thesis 688p)

This implies a MoS of only -1% to +8% from the entry price of 486p -- far below the thesis's claimed 29%.

**Why the large gap?**
1. Thesis uses OEY (which produces high FV when you assume 8% growth forever)
2. I use multiple-based valuation (which reflects what investors actually pay)
3. The market is pricing AUTO.L at 14.8x P/E for a reason -- ARPA deceleration + Deal Builder risk
4. Analyst consensus at 725-858p is higher than my estimate, but consensus includes bull cases and is still being revised downward

## Conflicts with Thesis

| Issue | Thesis Says | Evidence Says |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| ARPA Growth | 5% sustainable | Decelerating: 11.7% -> 6.3% -> 3.5% |
| Deal Builder | 1.2% noise | 22% of dealers organized, Jefferies downgraded |
| Bear Case | 500p (3% downside) | Realistic bear: 350-400p (22-28% downside) |
| FV | 688p (OEY method) | Peer-based: 480-600p |
| Growth Rate Used | 8% | Actual revenue: 5%, EPS: 7-8% (buyback-enhanced) |
| Valuation Methods | OEY + Peers (no DCF) | Should include DCF as independent cross-check |
| Sector View | Recommended creating one | Not created before purchase |
| FCA Risk | Not mentioned | GBP 8.2B compensation scheme impacts finance ecosystem |
| AI Disruption | Not mentioned | Cited by AJ Bell, analyst commentary as structural concern |

## Veredicto Global

| Metric | Valor |
|--------|-------|
| Desafios HIGH/CRITICAL | 4 de 10 (3 HIGH + 1 CRITICAL) |
| Additional risks not in thesis | 6 |
| Desafios no resueltos por thesis | 7 |
| Total Counter Strength | 21/30 |
| Veredicto | **STRONG COUNTER** |

### Interpretacion:

**STRONG COUNTER** -- The thesis has serious problems:

1. **The bear case is not a bear case** (CRITICAL) -- 500p for a bear scenario when the stock already traded at 473p means the risk/reward framework is broken.

2. **ARPA deceleration is ignored** (HIGH) -- The most important metric for AutoTrader's revenue growth has decelerated from 11.7% to 3.5% in 12 months and the thesis assumes indefinite 5% growth.

3. **Deal Builder is dismissed too quickly** (HIGH) -- 22% of the dealer base organized against the company. Jefferies downgraded. The April 2026 pricing event (52 days away) is a binary catalyst.

4. **Valuation is model-dependent** (HIGH) -- OEY with 8% growth produces 720p. Peer multiples produce 480-600p. The gap is too large to average away.

### What is NOT wrong with the thesis:

- The business IS quality. 50% FCF margin, near-zero debt, dominant market position.
- The QS 79 (Tier A) is reasonable (though I'd argue 72-75 given ARPA deceleration risk).
- The position is small (3.4%) -- limited risk of permanent capital destruction.
- The competitive moat is real today.

---

## Recomendacion al Investment Committee

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Revise the bear case** from 500p to 350-400p. Recalculate expected value with realistic scenarios.

2. **Run a proper DCF** using dcf_calculator.py to get an independent valuation cross-check.

3. **DO NOT ADD at 450p trigger** until after the April 2026 pricing event resolves. The current ADD trigger is ABOVE my conservative base FV of 480-530p and far too close to the entry price to justify adding risk before the key catalyst.

4. **Create the sector view** for online classifieds/digital marketplaces before making any further decisions.

5. **Monitor ARPA deceleration closely** at FY2026 results (May 21, 2026). If H2 FY2026 ARPA growth is below 4%, the sustainable growth assumption is invalidated.

6. **Set a new kill condition**: "ARPA growth turns negative OR dealer count declines >3% OR April 2026 pricing event causes >500 cancellations/downgrades."

### Position Sizing:

The current 3.4% position is APPROPRIATE given the uncertainty. Do not increase until:
- April 2026 pricing event resolves positively
- FY2026 results confirm ARPA growth stabilization at 5%+
- A proper sector view and independent valuation report are completed

### Key Dates to Monitor:

| Date | Event | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| April 1, 2026 | Annual pricing event (5.5% increase) | Binary catalyst for dealer revolt thesis |
| May 21, 2026 | FY2026 full year results | ARPA growth, dealer count, Deal Builder resolution |
| Early 2026 | FCA motor finance final rules | Finance ecosystem impact |

## 🔄 META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres
- I could not find specific data on Facebook Marketplace's share of UK used car listings vs AutoTrader. This data would be highly valuable but appears not to be publicly tracked.
- The OEY-implied FV is extremely sensitive to the growth rate assumption. I challenge the 8% but cannot definitively prove it should be 5% or 6%.
- Short interest data shows Kintbury Capital (1.01%) and Citadel (0.59%) shorting AUTO.L -- this is notable but not extreme.
- The ARPA deceleration from 11.7% to 3.5% could be a temporary anomaly (H2 is typically weaker as April pricing event effects fade) rather than a structural trend. Only FY2026 H2 data will resolve this.

### Limitaciones de Este Analisis
- No access to the FY2025 annual report PDF in full detail -- relied on press releases and analyst summaries.
- Could not access the H1 2026 analyst presentation PDF for detailed ARPA bridge data.
- Limited visibility into dealer-level economics (what % of a dealer's marketing budget goes to AutoTrader? Is there a breaking point?).
- No interviews with dealers -- the "3,000 joined Facebook group" data comes from media reports, not independent verification.

### Sugerencias para el Sistema
- **Create the missing sector view** for online classifieds/digital marketplaces IMMEDIATELY. AUTO.L, RMV.L (Rightmove), and MONY.L all benefit from similar analysis.
- **The bear case in ALL thesis documents should be stress-tested**: if the bear case is within 5% of entry price, it's not a real bear case.
- **Add a new validation check**: "Is the bear case >15% below entry price?" If not, flag it.
- **OEY should NOT be used as 60% primary method without a DCF cross-check.** The sensitivity to growth assumptions makes it unreliable as a standalone primary method.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator
1. Why was the full adversarial pipeline (moat-assessor, risk-identifier, valuation-specialist) not run for AUTO.L before purchase? This was a process violation.
2. Should the ADD trigger at 450p be suspended pending April 2026 pricing event resolution?
3. Should we create the online classifieds sector view now as a prerequisite for any further AUTO.L decisions?
4. The ARPA deceleration pattern (11.7% -> 6.3% -> 3.5%) is the most concerning finding. Should this be added as a new kill condition? e.g., "ARPA growth below 2% for 2 consecutive halves = EXIT."
