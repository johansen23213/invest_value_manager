# INGR - Ingredion Incorporated

> Last Updated: 2026-02-04
> Status: **WATCHLIST** - Attractive but needs ~10-15% more downside for Tier B MoS

---

## TL;DR

Ingredion is a global food ingredients company (starches, sweeteners, specialty texturizers) with a decent Quality Score (57/100, Tier B). The company has **narrow moat** through switching costs in specialty ingredients and 850+ patents. Stock is down 15% from 52-week highs due to: (1) Q4 2025 earnings miss, (2) operational issues at Argo facility, (3) weak Q1 2026 guidance. At $120.90, the stock trades at P/E 10.8x with 2.7% yield - **fairly valued to slightly cheap**, but **NOT cheap enough for required 20-25% MoS**. Fair value ~$135-145. Entry target: $105-110.

## Quality Score: 57/100 - Tier B (Quality Value)

| Category | Score | Max | Key Drivers |
|----------|-------|-----|-------------|
| **Financial Quality** | 24 | 40 | ROIC spread 3pp (adequate), FCF margin 15.3% (good), leverage 0.6x (excellent), FCF consistency 3/5 (mixed) |
| **Growth Quality** | 17 | 25 | Revenue CAGR 1.9% (weak), EPS CAGR 54%+ (inflated by base), GM expanding (good) |
| **Moat Evidence** | 10 | 25 | GM premium vs sector -12.7pp (below sector), market position #3-5, ROIC persistence adequate |
| **Capital Allocation** | 6 | 10 | 11+ years dividend increases, 0.8% insider ownership |

**Tier B Requirements:** MoS 20-25%

## Business Understanding

### What Ingredion Does

Ingredion transforms corn, tapioca, potatoes, and other plant-based materials into ingredient solutions for food & beverage, animal nutrition, brewing, and industrial markets. Revenue is derived from:

| Product Type | % of Revenue | Gross Margin |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Starches** | ~49% | Lower (commodity-like) |
| **Sweeteners** | ~35% | Lower (commodity-like) |
| **Specialty Ingredients (T&HS)** | ~16% | Higher (~2x core) |

**Business Model:** "Buy low, process, sell high" - agricultural inputs processed into value-added ingredient solutions. The value-add comes from:
1. Formulation expertise (clean label, sugar reduction, texture modification)
2. Regulatory knowledge (FDA, EFSA compliance)
3. Customer-specific development (co-creation)

### Revenue Segments (2025)

| Segment | Revenue | OI | Trend |
|---------|---------|-----|-------|
| Texture & Healthful Solutions (T&HS) | ~$2.3B | Growing | Best segment - specialty, higher margins |
| F&II - Latin America | ~$2.0B | Stable | Local market dynamics |
| F&II - US/Canada | ~$2.5B | Challenged | Argo facility issues, sweetener softness |

### Unit Economics

- **FCF Margin:** 15.3% (good for food ingredients)
- **ROE:** 16.2%
- **ROIC:** 11.1% vs WACC ~8% = **3pp spread (adequate, not exceptional)**
- **Net Debt/EBITDA:** 0.6x (very conservative)
- **Cash from Operations 2025:** $944M
- **Shareholder Returns 2025:** $435M ($211M dividends + $224M buybacks)

### Competitive Position

| Company | Market Cap | Revenue | Position |
|---------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **ADM** | $25B | $88B | #1 (commodity-focused) |
| **Cargill** | Private | $172B | #1 (private, diversified) |
| **Tate & Lyle** | $4B | $2B | #3-4 (specialty-focused) |
| **Ingredion** | $7.8B | $7.2B | #3-5 (balanced) |
| **Roquette** | Private | $5B | #4-5 (specialty-focused) |

Ingredion is **not the market leader** but has carved a niche in **specialty ingredients** where margins and switching costs are higher.

---

## Moat Analysis

### Switching Costs (Narrow Moat)

**Source:** Once Ingredion's proprietary formulations are embedded in customer products:
- Customers unwilling to risk brand equity by switching
- Reformulation requires R&D investment and regulatory re-approval
- Taste and texture consistency is critical for CPG brands

**Evidence:**
- ROIC > WACC for 10+ years
- Specialty ingredients business earns excess returns
- 850+ product-related patents and trademarks

**Limitation:**
- Core ingredients (starches, commodity sweeteners) are commoditized
- R&D at 3% of sales - lower than moatier operators
- ADM and Cargill have scale advantage

### Moat Rating: **Narrow** (specialty business only)

## Why Is It Cheap? (-15% from 52w high)

### Market Narrative

1. **Q4 2025 Earnings Miss:** EPS $2.53 vs $2.59 consensus, revenue $1.76B vs $1.78B
2. **Argo Facility Operational Issues:** Largest US/Canada plant had production difficulties, $40M operating income loss in 2025
3. **Weak Q1 2026 Guidance:** Net sales down low single digits, operating income down **mid-double digits**
4. **Beverage Sweetener Softness:** 7% decline in sweetener volumes (GLP-1 impact? trade-down?)
5. **Analyst Downgrades:** BMO cut target $143 to $123, Barclays cut $168 to $124

### My Contra-Thesis

| Market Fears | My View | Confidence |
|--------------|---------|------------|
| Argo issues ongoing | Management says Q1 2026 challenging but improving | Medium |
| Earnings decline | FY2026 guide $11-$11.80 vs $11.18 in 2025 = flat, not decline | High |
| Sweetener secular decline | GLP-1 impact real but manageable; specialty sweeteners (stevia) actually benefit | Medium |
| Commodity exposure | T&HS growing, shifting mix toward specialty | High |

### Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | SI/NO | Comment |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Industria en declive secular | NO | Food ingredients growing 4-5% CAGR |
| Disrupcion tecnologica inminente | NO | Clean label/healthy trends benefit specialty |
| Management destruyendo valor | NO | Conservative capital allocation, returning cash |
| Balance deteriorandose | NO | 0.6x Net Debt/EBITDA, very healthy |
| Insider selling masivo (>5% 12m) | NO | Not material |
| Dividend cut reciente/probable | NO | 11+ years of increases, 34% payout ratio |
| Perdida market share >2pp 3yr | NO | Specialty gaining share |
| ROIC < WACC ultimos 3 anos | NO | ROIC 11% vs WACC 8% |
| FCF negativo >2 anos | NO | FCF positive and strong |
| Goodwill >50% equity | NO | Normal levels |

**Value Trap Score: 0/10 - NOT a value trap**

## Valuation

### Method 1: EV/EBIT (60% weight)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Enterprise Value | $8.0B |
| Operating Income (EBIT) 2025 | $1,016M |
| Current EV/EBIT | 7.9x |

**Peer Comparison:**
| Company | EV/EBIT | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Tate & Lyle | 13.3x | Specialty-focused, premium |
| ADM | 9-10x | Commodity exposure |
| General Mills | 12-14x | CPG, more consumer-facing |
| Sector median (Food Processing) | 10-12x | |

**INGR at 7.9x is cheap vs peers** - but this reflects:
- US/Canada segment challenges
- Lower growth than pure specialty plays
- Earnings volatility

**Fair EV/EBIT:** 9-10x (discount to specialty peers, premium to commodity)

| Scenario | EBIT Multiple | EBIT | EV | - Net Debt | Equity | FV/Share |
|----------|--------------|------|-----|------------|--------|----------|
| Bear | 8x | $950M | $7.6B | $0.76B | $6.84B | $107 |
| Base | 9.5x | $1,020M | $9.69B | $0.76B | $8.93B | $140 |
| Bull | 11x | $1,100M | $12.1B | $0.76B | $11.34B | $178 |

### Method 2: P/E Multiple (40% weight)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current P/E | 10.8x |
| Forward P/E (FY26) | 10.6x |
| 5-year average P/E | ~14x |
| Sector average (Consumer Defensive) | 18-20x |

**INGR trades at significant discount to history and sector** due to:
- Operational issues
- Growth concerns
- Lower margin profile

**Fair P/E:** 12-13x (discount to sector, closer to historical average)

| Scenario | P/E Multiple | EPS | FV |
|----------|--------------|-----|-----|
| Bear | 11x | $10.50 | $115 |
| Base | 12.5x | $11.40 | $143 |
| Bull | 14x | $12.20 | $171 |

### Weighted Fair Value

| Method | Weight | Bear | Base | Bull |
|--------|--------|------|------|------|
| EV/EBIT | 60% | $107 | $140 | $178 |
| P/E | 40% | $115 | $143 | $171 |
| **Weighted** | 100% | **$110** | **$141** | **$175** |

### Expected Value

```
EV = Bear * 25% + Base * 50% + Bull * 25%
EV = ($110 * 0.25) + ($141 * 0.50) + ($175 * 0.25)
EV = $27.50 + $70.50 + $43.75
EV = $142
```

## Margin of Safety Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current Price | $120.90 |
| Fair Value (Base) | $141 |
| Fair Value (Bear) | $110 |
| Expected Value | $142 |
| MoS vs Base | 14% |
| MoS vs Bear | -10% (above bear case) |
| **MoS Required (Tier B)** | **20-25%** |

**VERDICT: Does NOT meet MoS requirement**

### Entry Price Target

To achieve 20% MoS vs Base ($141):
```
Entry Price = $141 * (1 - 0.20) = $113
```

To achieve 25% MoS vs Base:
```
Entry Price = $141 * (1 - 0.25) = $106
```

**Entry Target Range: $105-113** (need 10-15% drop from current)

## Catalysts

### Positive (Next 12 months)

| Catalyst | Timeline | Probability | Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Argo facility issues resolved | Q2 2026 | 70% | +5-10% |
| T&HS segment continues strong growth | FY2026 | 80% | +5% |
| Earnings beat expectations (consensus too low) | Q2-Q3 2026 | 50% | +10% |
| Rate cuts benefit yield stocks | H2 2026 | 40% | +5-10% |

### Negative (Risks)

| Risk | Timeline | Probability | Impact |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Argo issues persist longer | 2026 | 30% | -10-15% |
| GLP-1 accelerates sweetener decline | 2026-2027 | 25% | -5-10% |
| Input cost inflation (corn) | 2026 | 35% | -5% |
| Trade war / tariffs escalate | 2026 | 40% | -5-10% |

---

## Kill Conditions

**SELL immediately if:**

1. **ROIC falls below WACC** for 2+ consecutive years
2. **Dividend cut** (11+ year streak broken)
3. **Argo facility requires >$200M capex** to fix (destroys FCF thesis)
4. **T&HS segment growth turns negative** (specialty moat impaired)
5. **Net Debt/EBITDA exceeds 3x** (balance sheet deterioration)
6. **Management turnover at CEO + CFO** without clear succession

---

## Portfolio Fit

### Current Constraints (Post-Purchase)

| Constraint | Current | + INGR 4% | Limit | OK? |
|------------|---------|-----------|-------|-----|
| US Geography | 32% | 36% | 35% | NO (exceeds by 1%) |
| Consumer Staples Sector | ~15% | ~19% | 25% | YES |
| Single Position | - | 4% | 7% | YES |

**Issue:** US geography would exceed 35% limit. Either:
1. Size at 3% instead of 4%, or
2. Reduce another US position first

### Correlation Considerations

INGR has low correlation with:
- Tech positions (different cycle)
- Energy positions (different drivers)
- EU positions (different geography)

Moderate correlation with:
- TATE.L (same industry, but UK-based)
- Other Consumer Staples (GIS, IMB.L)

---

## Recommendation

### WATCHLIST - Entry at $105-113

**Rationale:**
- Quality business with narrow moat (Tier B)
- Conservative balance sheet, consistent shareholder returns
- Beaten down 15% due to temporary operational issues
- NOT a value trap (0/10 factors)
- BUT current MoS (14%) does NOT meet 20-25% requirement

**Action Plan:**
1. Set price alert at $113 (20% MoS)
2. Set price alert at $106 (25% MoS)
3. Monitor Q1 2026 results (April 2026) for Argo resolution
4. Re-evaluate if price drops to target

**Position Size at Entry:** 3% (to manage US geography constraint)

---

## Comparisons

| Metric | INGR | TATE.L | GIS |
|--------|------|--------|-----|
| P/E | 10.8x | 13.3x | 10.0x |
| Yield | 2.7% | 3.5% | 5.2% |
| ROIC | 11% | ~10% | ~12% |
| FCF Margin | 15% | ~8% | ~15% |
| Leverage | 0.6x | 1.5x | 3.5x |
| Geography | US | UK | US |
| Quality Score | 57 | ~55 | ~52 |

**INGR vs TATE.L:** Similar quality, INGR cheaper on P/E, but TATE already in portfolio (avoid concentration in food ingredients)

**INGR vs GIS:** Similar valuation, GIS higher yield but more debt. Both on watchlist. Prefer INGR for balance sheet quality.

## META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres

1. **Argo Facility Timeline:** Management says Q1 2026 still challenged, but timeline to full recovery uncertain. Could drag on longer than expected.

2. **GLP-1 Impact on Sweeteners:** Is the 7% sweetener volume decline cyclical or structural? GLP-1 drugs could accelerate decline, but specialty sweeteners (stevia, monk fruit) actually benefit.

3. **ROIC Spread Sustainability:** Current 3pp spread (11% vs 8% WACC) is adequate but not exceptional. If competition intensifies or T&HS growth slows, spread could narrow.

4. **DCF Unreliability:** The dcf_calculator.py showed extreme results (150%+ MoS) due to FCF volatility (CV=2.0). Used EV/EBIT and P/E instead, which feel more appropriate for this business type.

### Sugerencias de Mejora

1. **Add Food Ingredients sub-sector to consumer-staples.md** - Currently lumped together, but food ingredients (B2B) is quite different from consumer-facing CPG.

2. **Quality Scorer could use sector-specific GM comparison** - INGR shows -12.7pp GM vs "sector" but comparing to Consumer Defensive (which includes tobacco at 60%+ GM) is misleading. Should compare to food processing peers specifically.

3. **Create tool for EV/EBIT calculation** - DCF is unreliable for cyclical/volatile FCF companies. An EV/EBIT tool with peer multiples would be useful.

### Anomalias Detectadas

1. **EPS CAGR 54%+ in Quality Score** - This is inflated because EPS recovered from low base (likely COVID-impacted 2020-2021). Not representative of normalized growth (~5-7%).

2. **Analyst targets range widely:** $120 (BMO) to $143 (TipRanks average). Recent downgrade wave may have overshot.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator

1. **US Geography constraint:** Portfolio is at 32%, INGR would push to 35-36%. Should I recommend smaller size (3%) or is there a US position we should consider reducing?

2. **TATE.L already in portfolio:** Both are food ingredients. Is adding INGR too much concentration in this niche? Or is geographic diversification (UK vs US) sufficient?

3. **Consumer Staples sector allocation:** Currently ~15%. Adding INGR at 3-4% pushes to 18-19%. Is this appropriate given our NEUTRAL stance on the sector?
