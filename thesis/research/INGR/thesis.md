# INGR - Ingredion Incorporated

> Last Updated: 2026-02-05
> Status: **WATCHLIST** - Attractive but needs ~10-15% more downside for Tier B MoS
> Framework Version: 4.0

---

## TL;DR

Ingredion is a global food ingredients company (starches, sweeteners, specialty texturizers) with Quality Score 57/100 (Tier B). The company has **narrow moat** through switching costs in specialty ingredients and 850+ patents. Stock is down 15% from 52-week highs due to: (1) Q4 2025 earnings miss, (2) operational issues at Argo facility, (3) weak Q1 2026 guidance. At $119.96, the stock trades at P/E 10.5x forward with 2.7% yield - **fairly valued to slightly cheap**, but **NOT cheap enough for required 20-25% MoS**. Fair value ~$141-167. Entry target: $105-113.

## Business Understanding

### What Ingredion Does

Ingredion transforms corn, tapioca, potatoes, and other plant-based materials into ingredient solutions for food & beverage, animal nutrition, brewing, and industrial markets. Revenue is derived from:

| Product Type | % of Revenue | Gross Margin |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Starches** | ~49% | Lower (commodity-like) |
| **Sweeteners** | ~35% | Lower (commodity-like) |
| **Specialty Ingredients (T&HS)** | ~16% | Higher (~2x core) |

**Business Model:** "Buy low, process, sell high" - agricultural inputs processed into value-added ingredient solutions. The value-add comes from:
1. Formulation expertise (clean label, sugar reduction, texture modification)
2. Regulatory knowledge (FDA, EFSA compliance)
3. Customer-specific development (co-creation via Idea Labs)

### Revenue Segments (2025 Actual)

| Segment | Revenue | Op Income | YoY Change |
|---------|---------|-----------|------------|
| Texture & Healthful Solutions (T&HS) | $2.397B | $405M | +1% sales, +16% OI |
| F&II - Latin America | $2.341B | $493M | -4% sales, +2% OI |
| F&II - US/Canada | $2.013B | $315M | -7% sales, **-16% OI** |
| All Other | $468M | -$2M | +2% sales, improving |

**Key Observation:** T&HS (specialty) is the growth engine with expanding margins. US/Canada segment is challenged due to Argo facility issues.

### Unit Economics

- **FCF Margin:** 15.3% (FCF $511M / Revenue $7.2B)
- **ROE:** 16.2%
- **ROIC:** ~11% vs WACC ~8% = **3pp spread (adequate, not exceptional)**
- **Net Debt/EBITDA:** 0.6x (very conservative)
- **Cash from Operations 2025:** $944M (elevated, includes working capital)
- **Shareholder Returns 2025:** $435M ($211M dividends + $224M buybacks)

### Competitive Position

| Company | Market Cap | Revenue | Position | Mix |
|---------|-----------|---------|----------|-----|
| **ADM** | $32B | $88B | #1 | Commodity-focused |
| **Cargill** | Private | $172B | #1 | Diversified |
| **Tate & Lyle** | $1.7B | $2B | #3-4 | Specialty-focused |
| **Ingredion** | $7.6B | $7.2B | #3-5 | Balanced |
| **Kerry Group** | ~$15B | $10B | #2-3 | Specialty-focused |
| **Roquette** | Private | $5B | #4-5 | Specialty-focused |

Ingredion is **not the market leader** but has carved a niche in **specialty ingredients** where margins and switching costs are higher.

## Moat Analysis

### Narrow Moat - Switching Costs + Intangible Assets

**Source:** Once Ingredion's proprietary formulations are embedded in customer products:
- Customers unwilling to risk brand equity by switching
- Reformulation requires R&D investment and regulatory re-approval
- Taste and texture consistency is critical for CPG brands

**Evidence:**
- ROIC > WACC for 10+ years
- Specialty ingredients business earns excess returns
- 850+ product-related patents and trademarks
- 50%+ of 2026 protein isolate volume already contracted

**Limitation:**
- Core ingredients (starches, commodity sweeteners) are commoditized
- R&D at 3% of sales - lower than moatier operators
- ADM and Cargill have scale advantage
- GM -12.7pp vs sector shows commodity drag

### Moat Rating: **Narrow** (specialty business only)

---

## Why Is It Cheap? (-15% from 52w high)

### Market Narrative

1. **Q4 2025 Earnings Miss:** EPS $2.53 vs $2.59 consensus, revenue $1.8B down 2% YoY
2. **Argo Facility Operational Issues:** Largest US/Canada plant had production difficulties, $16M Q4 impact, ~$40M FY2025 impact
3. **Weak Q1 2026 Guidance:** Net sales down low single digits, operating income down **mid-double digits** vs tough Q1 2025 comp
4. **Beverage Sweetener Softness:** Volume pressure on commodity sweeteners
5. **Analyst Downgrades:** BMO cut target $143 to $120, Barclays cut $168 to $124

### My Contra-Thesis

| Market Fears | My View | Confidence |
|--------------|---------|------------|
| Argo issues ongoing | Management: "plan to run at normal to full capacities in 2026" | Medium |
| Earnings decline | FY2026 guide $11-$11.80 vs $11.18 in 2025 = flat to slight growth | High |
| Sweetener secular decline | GLP-1 impact real but manageable; specialty sweeteners (stevia) actually benefit from health trends | Medium |
| Commodity exposure | T&HS growing +16% OI, shifting mix toward specialty | High |

### Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | SI/NO | Comment |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Industria en declive secular | NO | Food ingredients growing 4-5% CAGR |
| Disrupcion tecnologica inminente | NO | Clean label/healthy trends benefit specialty |
| Management destruyendo valor | NO | Conservative capital allocation, returning $435M in 2025 |
| Balance deteriorandose | NO | 0.6x Net Debt/EBITDA, very healthy |
| Insider selling masivo (>5% 12m) | NO | Not material |
| Dividend cut reciente/probable | NO | 11+ years of increases, 34% payout ratio safe |
| Perdida market share >2pp 3yr | NO | Specialty gaining share |
| ROIC < WACC ultimos 3 anos | NO | ROIC 11% vs WACC 8% consistently |
| FCF negativo >2 anos | NO | FCF positive and strong |
| Goodwill >50% equity | NO | Normal levels |

**Value Trap Score: 0/10 - NOT a value trap**

## Valuation

### Method 1: P/E Multiple (60% weight)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current Price | $119.96 |
| EPS 2025 (adj) | $11.13 |
| EPS 2026E (mid) | $11.40 |
| P/E on 2025 | 10.8x |
| P/E on 2026E | 10.5x |

**INGR trades at significant discount to history (14x avg) and sector (18-20x)**

| Scenario | P/E | EPS | Fair Value |
|----------|-----|-----|------------|
| Bear | 11x | $11.40 | $125 |
| Base | 14x | $11.40 | $160 |
| Bull | 17x | $11.40 | $194 |

| Market Cap | $7.6B |
| Net Debt | $0.76B |
| Enterprise Value | $8.36B |
| EBITDA (est) | $1.2B |
| Current EV/EBITDA | 7.0x |

| Scenario | Multiple | Implied FV/share |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| Bear | 8x | $139 |
| Base | 10x | $177 |
| Bull | 12x | $215 |

### Weighted Fair Value

| Method | Weight | Bear | Base | Bull |
|--------|--------|------|------|------|
| P/E | 60% | $125 | $160 | $194 |
| EV/EBITDA | 40% | $139 | $177 | $215 |

## Margin of Safety Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current Price | $119.96 |
| Fair Value (Bear) | $131 |
| Fair Value (Base) | $167 |
| Fair Value (Bull) | $202 |
| Expected Value | $167 |
| **MoS vs Bear** | **8.4%** |
| **MoS vs Base** | **28.0%** |
| MoS vs EV | 28.0% |
| **MoS Required (Tier B precedent)** | **20-25%** |

### Analysis per Framework v4.0 Principles

**Principle 5 (QS as Input):** QS 57 suggests moderate risk. The question is whether 8.4% MoS vs Bear case is sufficient protection.

**Principle 7 (Consistency):** Looking at precedents in decisions_log.yaml:
- HRB (Tier B, QS 73): Bought at MoS 42%
- ADBE (Tier A, QS 76): Bought at MoS 31%

INGR at 8% MoS vs Bear is BELOW precedent patterns for Tier B.

**Conclusion:** MoS vs Base (28%) is adequate, but MoS vs Bear (8.4%) is insufficient. This creates asymmetric risk - if Bear scenario materializes, downside protection is minimal.

### Entry Price Target

| Target | Price | MoS vs Base | MoS vs Bear |
|--------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Entry 1 (20% MoS) | $134 | 20% | N/A |
| Entry 2 (25% MoS) | $125 | 25% | -5% |
| **Preferred Entry** | **$105-113** | **32-37%** | **15-20%** |

---

## Kill Conditions

**SELL immediately if:**

1. **ROIC falls below WACC** for 2+ consecutive years
2. **Dividend cut** (11+ year streak broken)
3. **Argo facility requires >$200M capex** to fix or becomes structural issue
4. **T&HS segment growth turns negative** (specialty moat impaired)
5. **Net Debt/EBITDA exceeds 3x** (balance sheet deterioration)
6. **FCF <$300M** for 2 consecutive years (vs $511M 2025)

## Catalysts

### Positive (Next 12 months)

| Catalyst | Timeline | Probability | Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Argo facility normalization | Q2-Q3 2026 | 75% | +5-10% |
| T&HS continued growth (clean label) | FY2026 | 80% | +5-10% |
| Earnings beat low expectations | Q2-Q3 2026 | 50% | +10% |
| Multiple re-rating to peers | 12-18 months | 40% | +15-20% |

### Negative (Risks)

| Risk | Timeline | Probability | Impact |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Argo issues persist beyond Q2 | 2026 | 25% | -10-15% |
| GLP-1 accelerates sweetener decline | 2026-2027 | 20% | -5-10% |
| Input cost inflation (corn prices) | 2026 | 35% | -5% |
| Tariff escalation (LATAM exposure) | 2026 | 40% | -5-10% |

## Portfolio Fit Considerations

### Comparison with TATE.L (Already in Portfolio)

| Metric | INGR | TATE.L |
|--------|------|--------|
| Quality Score | 57 | ~55 (est) |
| P/E | 10.5x fwd | 55.9x (distorted by one-time items) |
| Yield | 2.7% | 5.3% |
| Leverage | 0.6x | ~1.5x |
| Market Position | #3-5 global | #5-6 global |
| Specialty Mix | ~33% T&HS | ~40%+ post CP Kelco |
| Geography | US/LATAM focus | UK/EU focus |
| Current Allocation | 0% | 3.1% |

**Observation:** Both are food ingredients companies. Adding INGR creates **sub-sector concentration** (~6-7% in food ingredients). However, geographic diversification is good (US vs UK).

### Geography Impact (Applying Principle 2)

| Scenario | US Exposure |
|----------|-------------|
| Current | 35.0% |
| +INGR 3% | 37.5% |
| +INGR 4% | 38.5% |

**Question per Principle 2:** "What event would affect all US positions?" Answer: US recession, tariff escalation, USD strength. Current US exposure is already high. Adding INGR increases concentration risk.

**Recommendation:** If buying INGR, size at 3% max to manage US geography.

---

## Recommendation

### WATCHLIST - Entry at $105-113

**Rationale per Framework v4.0:**

1. **Quality OK (QS 57 Tier B):** Solid but not exceptional business
2. **MoS vs Bear INSUFFICIENT:** Only 8.4% when precedents show 20-25% typical
3. **Argo Uncertainty:** Q1 2026 guidance weak, wait for resolution clarity
4. **Portfolio Concentration:** Already have TATE.L (3.1%), US exposure high

**Action Plan:**
1. Set price alert at $113 (20% MoS vs Base)
2. Set price alert at $105 (25% MoS vs Base, ~20% vs Bear)
3. Monitor Q1 2026 results (April 2026) for Argo update
4. Re-evaluate after earnings

**Position Size at Entry:** 3% max (manage US geography and food ingredients concentration)

## META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres

1. **Argo Facility Specifics:** The exact nature of "operational issues" is unclear (mechanical? labor? supply chain?). This affects probability and timeline of resolution. Management guidance is "improving through 2026" but lacks specificity.

2. **LATAM Tariff Exposure:** ~32% of revenue from LATAM (Mexico, Colombia, Brazil). If Trump tariffs extend to Mexico (25% already on some goods), could materially impact F&II-LATAM segment.

3. **DCF Reliability:** The DCF tool showed CV=2.0 (highly volatile FCF) and gave unreliable results ($239-396 FV). Used P/E and EV/EBITDA instead, which are more appropriate for this business type.

4. **TATE.L Comparison:** I couldn't get clean P/E for TATE.L (55.9x is distorted). Need better data to properly compare the two food ingredients companies.

### Sugerencias de Mejora

1. **Sector-specific GM comparison in quality_scorer.py:** Currently compares vs "Consumer Defensive" which includes tobacco at 60%+ GM. Should compare to food processing peers for more accurate moat evidence score.

2. **Create EV/EBIT tool:** For companies with volatile FCF (like INGR), an EV/EBIT valuation tool with automatic peer comparison would be more reliable than DCF.

3. **Tariff exposure scanner:** Given current geopolitical environment, a tool that identifies % revenue by country for tariff risk assessment would be valuable.

### Anomalias Detectadas

1. **EPS CAGR 54%+ in QS calculation:** This is inflated due to recovery from low base (likely COVID-impacted 2020-2021). Normalized EPS growth is ~5-7%. The QS may be slightly overstated due to this.

2. **TATE.L P/E 55.9x:** This seems distorted (possibly by one-time items or accounting). Need to verify normalized earnings for proper comparison.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator

1. **Food Ingredients Concentration:** With TATE.L at 3.1%, is adding INGR (to ~6-7% total in food ingredients) acceptable concentration risk? The businesses are similar but geographically diversified (UK vs US).

2. **US Geography at 35%+:** If we add INGR at 3%, US goes to 37.5%. Per Principle 2, should I consider this acceptable given US is "developed stable" category, or should we manage down US exposure first?

3. **Entry Timing:** Q1 2026 earnings (April) will provide Argo update. Should the standing order be conditional on positive Q1 guidance, or set now at lower entry price to catch any selloff?
