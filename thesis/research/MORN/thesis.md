# MORN - Morningstar, Inc.

> **Fair Value:** $180
> **Entry:** $135
> **Date:** 2026-02-13 (R3 resolved)
> **Status:** R3 COMPLETE - WATCHLIST (R4 deferred — 18% above entry)
> **Pipeline:** R1 ✓ | R2 ✓ (DA 13/19 STRONG COUNTER) | R3 ✓ (resolution) | R4 deferred
> **R3 Resolution (2026-02-13):** FV $205→$180 (-12%). DA 13/19 STRONG COUNTER. CRSP conflict of interest, growth 9%→7.5%, index fund fee pressure. QS 83→78 (Tier A). Entry $130-135 (25-28% MoS).

## TL;DR

Morningstar is a high-quality financial data and analytics compounder (QS Tool: 83, Adjusted: 80, Tier A) that has declined 53% from its 52-week high due to multiple compression as the market re-prices growth expectations downward. The business fundamentals are excellent: 60% gross margins, 10% revenue CAGR, 45% insider ownership (founder Joe Mansueto), and diversified revenue across six segments with strong switching costs. At $155, the base case DCF yields a fair value of $197 (27% MoS), making this an attractive entry for a quality compounder at a rare discount. Entry target: $145 provides 32% MoS; current price of $155 already provides meaningful value.

## Business Understanding

### What Morningstar Does

Morningstar provides independent investment research, data, and analytics to investors, financial advisors, asset managers, and institutions worldwide. Founded in 1984 by Joe Mansueto (who still owns ~45% of shares), the company has evolved from a mutual fund rating service into a diversified financial data platform.

**Core problem solved:** Investment decision-makers need independent, trusted, structured data and research to make informed allocation decisions. Morningstar provides this across multiple channels.

**Revenue model:** Primarily subscription/license-based (recurring), with growing asset-based and transaction-based components.

### Revenue Segments (Q3 2025)

| Segment | Q3 Revenue | Growth | Op Margin | Description |
|---------|-----------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Morningstar Direct Platform** | $211M | +6.3% | 44.4% | Core data/research platform for advisors and institutions |
| **PitchBook** | $169M | +7.9% | 31.3% | Private markets data (PE, VC, M&A). High growth segment |
| **Morningstar Credit (DBRS)** | $91M | +28.5% | 30.8% | 4th largest global credit rating agency. Fastest growing |
| **Morningstar Wealth** | $62M | +0.5% | 5.0% | Investment management, advisor software. Barely profitable |
| **Morningstar Retirement** | $34M | +7.5% | 49.4% | Retirement plan solutions. Small but very profitable |
| **Indexes/Sustainalytics/Other** | ~$51M | Flat | Mixed | Index licensing + ESG data. Sustainalytics declining |
| **Total** | **$617M** | **+8.4%** | **20.7% reported** | 24.4% adjusted operating margin |

### Revenue Type Mix

| Type | % of Revenue | Growth Q3 2025 | Characteristics |
|------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| License-based | ~65% | +6.4% | Subscriptions, highly recurring |
| Transaction-based | ~20% | +27.2% | Credit ratings issuance, cyclical |
| Asset-based | ~15% | +1.1% | AUM fees, market-dependent |

### Unit Economics

- **Recurring revenue:** ~80% of total (license + asset-based). Extremely sticky.
- **Customer retention:** High. Morningstar Direct, PitchBook, and Credit all have significant switching costs (data integration, workflow dependency, regulatory compliance).
- **LTV/CAC:** Not disclosed, but the combination of 60%+ gross margins, 10-year customer relationships, and annual contract escalators suggests LTV/CAC well above 5x.
- **FCF Margin:** ~20% (Q3 2025 annualized: $160M x 4 / $2.47B = 26%). Trailing 12M basis: ~19-20%.

### Margin Structure

```
Gross Margin:     60.6% (2024) -- expanding from 58.3% (2022)
Operating Margin: 18.5% (2024), 20.7% (Q3 2025) -- significant improvement trajectory
Adj Op Margin:    24.4% (Q3 2025) -- up from 22.9% YoY
FCF Margin:       ~19-20%

5-year trend: EXPANDING. 2022 was trough (9% operating margin). Recovery ongoing.
```

### Capital Intensity: LIGHT

- Capex: $35.6M in Q3 2025 (~6% of revenue). Primarily capitalized software development.
- Working capital: Light. Subscription model generates cash upfront.
- Maintenance capex estimated at $80-90M/year (depreciation x 1.1).

### Competitive Position

| Competitor | Strength vs MORN | MORN Advantage |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Bloomberg** | Dominant in trading terminals, real-time data | MORN stronger in advisor/retail research, independent ratings |
| **S&P Global** | Larger, broader (ratings, indices, data) | MORN has PitchBook (private markets), independent brand |
| **MSCI** | Dominant in equity factor indices | MORN has broader product suite, advisor channel |
| **FactSet** | Strong buy-side analytics | MORN has credit ratings, private markets, wealth platform |
| **Moody's** | #2 in credit ratings | DBRS is #4 but growing fastest, regulatory diversification demand |

**Market Position:** MORN is #1 in independent investment research for advisors/retail. #3-5 in broader financial data. #4 in credit ratings (DBRS, growing fast). #1 in private markets data (PitchBook). Niche leader across multiple verticals.

### Moat Analysis

**Sources of moat:**

1. **Brand/Trust (WIDE):** "Morningstar rating" is the gold standard for fund research among advisors and individual investors. 40+ years of independent research credibility.

2. **Data Network Effects (WIDE):** PitchBook has the largest private markets dataset. More users contribute more data, improving the product. Credit ratings create self-reinforcing demand (issuers need ratings, investors require them).

3. **Switching Costs (WIDE):** Morningstar Direct is deeply integrated into advisor workflows. Compliance and regulatory frameworks reference Morningstar methodologies. Switching requires retraining, data migration, and regulatory revalidation. Typical customer retention >90%.

4. **Regulatory Moat (MODERATE):** DBRS Morningstar is one of only ~10 globally recognized credit rating agencies (NRSRO designation in US, ESMA in EU). Regulatory barriers to entry are very high.

5. **Founder-Owner Alignment (STRONG):** Joe Mansueto owns ~45% of shares. One share = one vote. No dual-class structure needed because the founder IS the majority owner. Kunal Kapoor (CEO since 2017) is a 28-year company veteran.

## Why Is It Cheap? (-53% from 52w high)

### Market Narrative

The stock declined from $330 to $155 (53%) driven by:

1. **Multiple compression from extreme valuation.** MORN traded at 50-60x P/E at its highs. Market re-priced as growth normalized from post-COVID highs.
2. **Growth deceleration.** Revenue growth slowed from 12% (2024) to 8-9% (2025). PitchBook growth moderated.
3. **AI disruption fears.** Market worried that generative AI threatens traditional research/data businesses.
4. **Broader financial data sector rotation.** Information services stocks pulled back broadly.
5. **Sustainalytics/ESG headwind.** Anti-ESG political movement reducing demand.

### My Contra-Thesis

| Market Believes | I Believe | Evidence | P(Wrong) |
|-----------------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Growth is decelerating permanently | Growth is normalizing to sustainable 8-10% after COVID boost | Revenue CAGR 10.2% over 4 years. PitchBook/Credit still growing. | 25% |
| AI threatens research business | AI is a tool MORN can leverage, not a threat. MORN's value is curated data + methodology, not raw research | MORN is integrating AI into products. Advisor channel needs curated, compliant research, not raw AI output | 30% |
| P/E of 18x is appropriate for 8% grower | P/E of 18x for a 60% GM, 20% FCF margin, 45% insider-owned compounder with ROIC 20%+ is undervaluation | Peers trade at 25-45x P/E (SPGI 37x, MSCI 42x, FDS 30x). MORN at 18x is a massive discount | 15% |
| Sustainalytics is a drag | Sustainalytics is <5% of revenue. Core business (Direct + PitchBook + Credit) is strong | Q3 segment data shows core >90% of revenue growing well | 10% |

### Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | SI/NO | Comment |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Industry in secular decline | NO | Financial data/analytics is growing 8-11% CAGR |
| Technological disruption imminent | NO | AI enhances rather than replaces curated data |
| Management destroying value | NO | Founder-owned. $1B buyback at low prices. Conservative |
| Balance sheet deteriorating | NO | ND/EBITDA 0.9x, interest coverage 10.8x |
| Insider selling massive | NO | 45% insider ownership, Kapoor not selling |
| Dividend cut recent/probable | NO | Payout ratio 20.7%, dividend increasing |
| Market share loss >2pp 3yr | NO | Gaining share in credit, stable in data |
| ROIC < WACC last 3 years | NO | ROIC 20.5% vs WACC 9.5% = +11pp spread |
| FCF negative >2 years | NO | FCF positive every year |
| Goodwill >50% equity | UNCLEAR | DBRS/PitchBook acquisitions created goodwill, but manageable |

**Value Trap Score: 0-1/10 -- LOW risk.** This is not a value trap. It is a quality compounder that got expensive and is now normalizing to a reasonable valuation.

### My Informational Advantage

- [x] Longer time horizon (market prices in 1-year growth; MORN compounds over 5-10 years)
- [x] Market over-reacts to growth deceleration (from 12% to 8% is still excellent for this quality)
- [x] Quantitative analysis shows peers at 2-3x the multiple
- [ ] No unique proprietary insight -- this is "quality at a discount" thesis

## Projections

### Revenue Projection (Derived)

**TAM:** Global financial data & analytics market ~$50B (2025), growing at 8-10% CAGR. Morningstar's specific addressable segments:
- Investment research/data: ~$15B
- Private markets data: ~$8B
- Credit ratings: ~$12B
- Investment management/wealth tech: ~$10B

**Market Share:** MORN has ~$2.5B revenue in a ~$50B TAM = ~5% total share, but much higher shares in specific niches (PitchBook #1 in private markets data, DBRS #4 in ratings, Morningstar Direct #1 in advisor research).

**Pricing Power:** STRONG. Annual contract escalators (typically 3-5% per year). Switching costs prevent churn even with price increases. DBRS can increase issuance fees as market grows.

**Revenue Growth Derivation:**

```
TAM Growth:        +8% (financial data market CAGR)
Market Share:      +0.5pp/year (PitchBook gaining, Credit gaining, Direct stable)
Pricing Power:     +3% (annual escalators embedded in contracts)
= Organic Revenue Growth: ~8-10%

Conservative estimate: 8% (base), 6% (bear), 11% (bull)
```

**Revenue Trajectory:**

| Year | Revenue ($B) | Growth | Driver |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| 2024 (actual) | $2.28 | +11.6% | Strong across segments |
| 2025E | $2.47 | +8.3% | Normalizing growth, Q3 run-rate |
| 2026E | $2.67 | +8% | PitchBook/Credit drive; Wealth improving |
| 2027E | $2.88 | +8% | Operating leverage continues |
| 2028E | $3.11 | +8% | Credit scaling, Indexes recovering |

### Margin Projection

```
Gross Margin: 60.6% (2024) -> 61-62% (2028E)
  Expanding slightly: mix shift toward higher-margin software/data, Credit scaling.

Operating Margin: 18.5% (2024) -> 22-24% (2028E)
  Significant operating leverage. Fixed cost base (technology, research) scales with revenue.
  2022 was trough at 9%. Recovery to 18.5% (2024), 20.7% (Q3 2025).
  Path to 25%+ is credible based on trajectory and peer comps (SPGI ~47%, MSCI ~55%).

FCF Margin: 19.7% (2024) -> 22-24% (2028E)
  Low capex intensity (~6% of revenue). Strong cash conversion.
```

### WACC Derivation

```
Risk-Free Rate:     4.5% (US 10Y Treasury, Feb 2026)
Equity Risk Premium: 5.5%
Beta:               1.08 (from tool)
Cost of Equity (Ke): 4.5% + 1.08 * 5.5% = 10.4%

Cost of Debt (Kd):  4.8% (from tool, real interest expense / total debt)
Tax Rate:           21.2% (effective, from tool)
Kd after-tax:       4.8% * (1 - 0.212) = 3.8%

Capital Structure:
  Market Cap: $6.6B (equity weight ~87%)
  Total Debt: $1.0B (debt weight ~13%)

WACC = (0.87 * 10.4%) + (0.13 * 3.8%) = 9.5%
```

**Sanity check:** 9.5% WACC for a US-listed financial data company with moderate beta and investment-grade-equivalent leverage is reasonable.

### Terminal Growth: 2.5%

Financial data is a secular growth industry, but terminal growth must be <= GDP. 2.5% is reasonable: above pure GDP (2%) because financial markets and data demand have structural tailwinds (regulation, complexity, global capital flows).

## Valuation

### Method 1: Owner Earnings Yield (Tier A Primary, 60% weight)

```
FCF (TTM): ~$500M (extrapolating Q3 2025 YTD $428M + Q4E ~$180M = ~$610M; but use 2024 actual $449M + growth)
Conservative FCF estimate 2025: $520M

Depreciation (2024): ~$160M
Maintenance Capex = Depreciation * 1.1 = $176M

Owner Earnings = FCF ($520M) - Maint Capex ($176M) + D&A added back in FCF already
Actually: FCF already deducts capex. So:
Owner Earnings = FCF + D&A - Maint Capex = $520M (FCF already net of capex)
Better calculation: Owner Earnings = Net Income + D&A - Maintenance Capex
                   = ~$370M + $160M - $176M = $354M

Owner Earnings Yield = $354M / $6.6B Market Cap = 5.4%

Expected Growth: 8-10% (derived above)
OEY + Growth = 5.4% + 9% = 14.4% vs WACC 9.5%

Spread: +4.9pp above cost of capital -- ATTRACTIVE

Implied Fair Value via OEY:
If we require OEY + Growth = WACC + 3% spread (as risk premium):
Min acceptable OEY = 12.5% - 9% growth = 3.5%
At 3.5% OEY: FV = $354M / 0.035 = $10.1B equity = ~$238/share

If we require OEY + Growth = WACC + 2% spread:
Min acceptable OEY = 11.5% - 9% = 2.5%
At 2.5% OEY: FV = $354M / 0.025 = $14.2B equity -- too optimistic

Conservative: OEY implying WACC + 4% spread = 13.5% - 9% = 4.5% OEY
FV = $354M / 0.045 = $7.9B equity = ~$186/share

OEY Fair Value Range: $186 - $238/share
Central estimate (3.5% OEY): $210/share
```

### Method 2: DCF with Derived Parameters (40% weight)

Using derived WACC 9.5%, growth 9%, terminal 2.5%:

**Base case DCF: $197/share** (MoS +27% vs current $155)

**Sensitivity assessment:**
- FV Spread: 77% -- HIGH sensitivity
- Terminal Value as % of EV: 74.4% -- HIGH
- This means the DCF is sensitive to assumptions. Use as a range, not a point estimate.

**DCF Scenario Summary:**

| Scenario | Growth | WACC | Terminal | FV/share | MoS vs $155 |
|----------|--------|------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Bear | 7% | 10.5% | 2.0% | $148 | -5% |
| Base | 9% | 9.5% | 2.5% | $197 | +27% |
| Bull | 11% | 8.5% | 3.0% | $275 | +77% |

### Reconciliation

| Method | Fair Value | Weight | Weighted |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Owner Earnings Yield | $210 | 60% | $126 |
| DCF (Base) | $197 | 40% | $79 |
| **Weighted Average** | | 100% | **$205** |

**Divergence between methods: 6.5%** -- LOW. Both methods converge around $197-210.

**Sensitivity Assessment:**
- FV Spread 77%, TV 74.4% of EV = HIGH sensitivity
- This means I should use a RANGE ($185-$215) rather than a point estimate
- MoS requirement should be somewhat higher to compensate for DCF sensitivity

### Peer Comparison (Sanity Check)

| Company | P/E | EV/EBIT | Revenue Growth | Op Margin |
|---------|-----|---------|----------------|-----------|
| SPGI | 37x | 30x | 14% | 47% |
| MSCI | 42x | 35x | 15% | 55% |
| FDS | 30x | 25x | 6% | 33% |
| MCO | 35x | 28x | 20% | 44% |
| **MORN** | **18x** | **~16x** | **8%** | **21%** |

MORN trades at a massive discount to peers. Even adjusting for lower margins (MORN is earlier in its margin expansion journey), 18x P/E for this quality profile is historically cheap. At peer-average 30x P/E, MORN would be $259/share. Even at a 30% discount to peers (20x P/E normalized EPS ~$9.50): $190/share.

---

## Scenarios

| | Bear | Base | Bull |
|--|------|------|------|
| Thesis | Growth decelerates to 6%, margins stagnate at 20%, AI disrupts research | Steady 8-9% growth, margins expand to 23-25%, PitchBook/Credit scale | Credit ratings take significant share, margins reach 28%+, PitchBook becomes dominant private data platform |
| FV | $148 | $205 | $275 |
| Probability | 25% | 50% | 25% |

**Expected Value = ($148 x 0.25) + ($205 x 0.50) + ($275 x 0.25) = $37 + $102.50 + $68.75 = $208**

---

## Margin of Safety

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current Price | $155 |
| Fair Value (Weighted) | $205 |
| Expected Value | $208 |
| MoS vs Base FV | **+32%** |
| MoS vs EV | **+34%** |
| MoS vs Bear | **-5%** |

**Assessment:** At $155, MoS of 32% vs base and 34% vs EV is excellent for a Tier A compounder. The bear case at $148 is only 5% below current price, providing strong downside protection: even in the bear case, the downside is minimal.

**Precedent comparison:** ADBE was bought at 31% MoS (Tier A). NVO at 38% MoS (Tier A). MORN at 32% MoS is consistent with these precedents.

### Entry Analysis

Our preliminary target was $145. At that price:
- MoS vs Base: 41%
- MoS vs Bear: +2%

$145 provides excellent entry, but $155 is already attractive. The stock is at 52-week lows and Q4 results (reporting today after close) could either push it lower or trigger a re-rating.

**Recommendation:** Entry at current $155 is justified. Standing order at $145 for ADD if it drops further.

### Sizing Reasoning

MORN is Tier A (QS 80 adjusted). Precedents for Tier A initial positions: ADBE 4.8%, NVO 3.4%, MONY.L 4.1%.

Given:
- Conviction: HIGH (quality compounder at rare discount)
- Risk: MODERATE (earnings today could be catalyst or headwind; Q4 consensus is $2.36 EPS)
- Portfolio context: 44% cash, 13 positions, no financial data exposure
- Correlation with existing positions: LOW (no overlap with current sectors)

**Suggested initial sizing: 3-4% (~EUR 450-550)**

If price drops below $145 post-earnings: ADD to full 5-6% position.

If earnings are strong: BUY at market. Waiting for $145 may mean missing the opportunity if Q4 results trigger re-rating.

---

## Kill Conditions

1. **Revenue growth turns negative for 2+ consecutive quarters** (not one-time, sustained organic decline)
2. **Operating margin falls below 15% and trajectory reverses** (regression from current 20%+ back to 2022 trough levels)
3. **PitchBook growth decelerates below 5%** (PitchBook is the crown jewel growth engine; if it stalls, the thesis weakens)
4. **Joe Mansueto sells >10% of his stake in 12 months** (founder alignment is a key thesis pillar)
5. **AI-native competitor gains material market share in advisor research** (a new entrant using AI to deliver equivalent research at 80% lower cost would threaten the core business)
6. **DBRS loses NRSRO or ESMA designation** (regulatory moat impaired)
7. **QS drops below 70** (reclassification to Tier B would require re-evaluation of entire thesis)

---

## Catalizadores

| Catalyst | Timeline | Probability | Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Q4 2025 earnings (today, Feb 12) | Immediate | HIGH | +/-10% depending on results vs $2.36 EPS consensus |
| Margin expansion continuation | 6-12 months | HIGH | Operating margin from 20% toward 25% drives re-rating |
| PitchBook price increases/cross-selling | 6-12 months | MEDIUM | PitchBook has pricing power; recent data feeds expansion |
| Credit ratings volume recovery | 6-12 months | MEDIUM | Lower rates = more issuance = more DBRS revenue |
| Share buyback at depressed prices | Ongoing | HIGH | $1B authorization, buying back at 18x P/E is highly accretive |
| Multiple re-rating toward peers | 12-24 months | MEDIUM | Even partial re-rating from 18x to 25x = +39% |

---

## Macro Connection

| Factor | Sensitivity | Current Impact |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| Interest rates | MEDIUM | Lower rates = more debt issuance = more Credit revenue. Higher rates = slightly less mortgage activity but MORN benefits from investment allocation complexity |
| Recession | LOW-MEDIUM | License revenue (65%) is recurring and sticky. Asset-based (~15%) would decline. Transaction-based (~20%) would moderate |
| Inflation | LOW | Strong pricing power absorbs inflation through annual contract escalators |
| USD strength | LOW | 71% US revenue, 29% international. Strong dollar has modest negative impact on reported numbers |
| AI disruption | MEDIUM | Both risk and opportunity. Risk to traditional research; opportunity to enhance products and reduce costs |

**Fit with World View:** NEUTRAL-FAVORABLE. US mid-cycle, labor market resilient. Financial data demand is structural not cyclical. Inflation sticky but MORN has pricing power. Cash 44% in portfolio needs deployment; MORN is an excellent quality candidate.

---

## Veredicto: BUY

**Morningstar is a quality compounder (Tier A, QS 80) trading at a historically rare discount.** At $155, it offers 32% MoS to base fair value with minimal downside in the bear case (-5%). The 53% decline from highs is driven by multiple compression, not fundamental deterioration. Revenue is growing 8-9%, margins are expanding, the founder owns 45%, and the business has wide moat characteristics.

**Recommended action:**
- Entry at current ~$155 justified for initial position (3-4%, ~EUR 450-550)
- Standing order at $145 for ADD to 5-6%
- Pending: Q4 results today after close. If results beat consensus ($2.36 EPS), consider accelerating entry

---

## META-REFLECTION

### Incertidumbres/Dudas

- **Q4 results are literally today (Feb 12 after close).** I am completing this analysis without knowing Q4 results. If revenue misses or management guides lower for 2026, the stock could drop further. This is a timing uncertainty, not a thesis uncertainty. The fundamental quality case holds regardless of one quarter.
- **AI disruption risk is genuinely uncertain.** I assigned 30% probability of being wrong on the AI thesis. If AI-native tools can replicate Morningstar's curated ratings and research at a fraction of the cost, the moat erodes. My base case is that AI enhances rather than replaces Morningstar's data advantage, but this deserves monitoring.
- **Sustainalytics/ESG segment.** Anti-ESG political sentiment in the US could continue to drag this segment. It is small (<5% of revenue) but the trend is worth watching.
- **The DCF has HIGH sensitivity** (FV Spread 77%, TV 74.4% of EV). The $197 point estimate should be treated as a range ($185-$215).

### Sugerencias de Mejora

- **Tool improvement:** `quality_scorer.py` scores Market Position as 0/8 (manual input). This should either auto-populate from a reference dataset or prompt the user for input more clearly. For data/analytics companies, this metric significantly affects the QS.
- **Sector view:** The financial-data-analytics.md sector view exists but MORN should be added to it as an analyzed company with pipeline status.

### Anomalias Detectadas

- **P/E compression is extreme vs peers.** MORN at 18x vs SPGI 37x, MSCI 42x, FDS 30x. Even adjusting for lower margins, this spread (~50% discount) is historically unusual. This suggests either (a) the market sees a structural problem I am missing, or (b) the market is wrong and this is an opportunity. The fundamental data supports (b): ROIC 20%, FCF growing, moat intact.
- **EPS trajectory:** 2022 EPS was $1.65 (trough). 2024 was $8.64. TTM is running higher. The "P/E of 18x" may be on peak-ish earnings, which would make the discount less extreme. However, even on normalized EPS (~$8-9), 18-19x is cheap for this quality.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator

1. Should we wait for Q4 results (tonight) before moving to R2/R3/R4, or is the fundamental analysis strong enough to proceed with devil's advocate immediately?
2. Given Q4 reports today, should the standing order be set NOW at $145 for the human to execute between sessions, or should we wait for post-earnings clarity?
3. The financial-data-analytics.md sector view needs MORN added. Should I update it now as part of this R1 output?
