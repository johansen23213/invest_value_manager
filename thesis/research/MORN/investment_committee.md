## GATE 1: QUALITY SCORE (CRITICAL)

- **QS Tool:** 83/100 (Tier A)
- **QS Adjusted (R1 thesis):** 80/100 (Tier A) -- Adjustment: -3 for Market Position
- **QS R3 Resolution:** 78/100 (Tier A, low-end) -- Further -2 for CRSP conflict + FCF decline
- **Committee QS:** 78/100 (Tier A, low-end)
- **Result:** PASS

---

## GATE 2: BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

- **2-minute explanation:** Morningstar provides independent investment research data, fund ratings (star rating gold standard), private markets data (PitchBook, #1), credit ratings (DBRS, #4 globally), and wealth management tools. Revenue ~80% recurring. 60% GM, 20% FCF margins, ROIC 20.5% vs WACC 9.5%. Founded 1984, Mansueto 45% owner. Six segments: PitchBook and Credit as growth engines, Direct/Retirement as cash cows, Wealth/Sustainalytics as drags.
- **Why cheap:** Multiple compression from 50-60x P/E as growth normalized. AI disruption fear. Down 51% from 52w high.
- **Value Trap Checklist:** 0-1/10 SI. ROIC >> WACC, FCF positive, no industry decline.
- **Result:** PASS

---

## GATE 3: PROJECTION FUNDAMENTADA

- **Revenue growth:** 8-9% base (R3 resolved, was 9-10% thesis, DA argued 7%)
- **WACC:** 9.5% (thesis) / 10% (DA). Committee uses 9.75%.
- **Terminal growth:** 2.0-2.5% range
- **Scenarios:** Bear $148 (25%), Base $205 (50%), Bull $275 (25%)
- **DCF sensitivity:** FV Spread 77%, TV 74.4% of EV. Range $165-185 more honest than point estimate.
- **Result:** PASS (with noted high DCF sensitivity)

---

## GATE 4: VALUATION MULTI-METHOD

| Method | FV | Weight | Weighted |
|--------|-----|--------|----------|
| OEY (conservative 4.5%) | $186 | 60% | $111.60 |
| DCF (8%/9.75%/2.25%) | $175 | 40% | $70.00 |
| **Weighted Average** | | 100% | **$182** |

- **Divergence between methods:** 6.3% -- LOW convergence around $175-186.
- **Committee Fair Value:** $180 (range $165-185)
- **Result:** PASS

---

## GATE 5: MARGIN OF SAFETY (RAZONADO v4.0)

- **Current Price:** $160.03 (2026-02-14)
- **MoS vs Base ($180):** +11.1%
- **MoS vs Bear ($148):** -8.1%

**Razonamiento:**
1. 11% MoS is the LOWEST ever for Tier A (precedents 29-38%). No justification to break pattern.
2. Bear MoS NEGATIVE (-8.1%) — in downside we lose money from entry.
3. CRSP conflict adds UNQUANTIFIED risk demanding MORE MoS, not less.
4. Q4 beat (+20% EPS) barely moved stock — market skepticism at this level.

**At $130-135 entry:** MoS 25-28%, bear MoS +9-12%. Consistent with precedents.

- **Result:** FAIL at $160. CONDITIONAL PASS at $130-135.

---

## GATE 6: MACRO CONTEXT

- Financial data demand structural, not cyclical. Lower rates positive for DBRS. AI creates both risk and opportunity.
- **Result:** PASS

---

## GATE 7: PORTFOLIO FIT (RAZONADO v4.0)

- Position 4%: coherent with Tier A precedents (3.4-4.8%). 50% drawdown = -2.0% portfolio.
- Sector Financial Services 18.5%: LOW actual correlation (insurance ≠ financial data).
- Cash post-buy 53%: ample dry powder remains.
- Correlation with existing: LOW. Adds genuine diversification.
- **Result:** PASS (contingent on entry at $130-135)

---

## GATE 8: SECTOR UNDERSTANDING

- Sector view verified. Global financial data TAM ~$50B, 8-10% CAGR.
- No current portfolio exposure to financial data/analytics.
- **Result:** PASS

---

## GATE 9: AUTOCRITICA

**Kill Conditions (9 total):**
1. Revenue growth negative 2+ consecutive quarters
2. Operating margin falls below 15% + trajectory reverses
3. PitchBook growth decelerates below 5%
4. Mansueto sells >10% of stake in 12 months
5. AI-native competitor gains material share in advisor research
6. DBRS loses NRSRO or ESMA designation
7. QS drops below 70
8. Regulatory investigation into ratings objectivity (CRSP-related)
9. Vanguard announces CRSP benchmark replacement

**Biases:** Confirmation (high QS predisposes approval), anchoring ($205 original FV), quality premium (tendency to accept lower MoS for quality).

- **Result:** PASS

---

## GATE 10: COUNTER-ANALYSIS & INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENTS

- **DA:** 13/19 STRONG COUNTER, FV $163. All HIGH challenges addressed by R3 or committee.
- **Moat:** WIDE 20/25. Agreed.
- **Risk:** MEDIUM, 4 HIGH. All now documented with kill conditions.
- **Result:** PASS
