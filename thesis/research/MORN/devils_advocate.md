# Counter-Analysis: MORN (Morningstar, Inc.)

## Fecha: 2026-02-13

## Resumen Ejecutivo

The thesis survives scrutiny as a quality business, but the valuation is materially overstated. The $205 fair value is built on optimistic growth (9%), a generous WACC (9.5%), and a 60/40 OEY/DCF blend where the OEY method produces an implausibly high $210 FV. The thesis omits the $365M CRSP acquisition entirely -- a material governance event that threatens the brand moat. Joe Mansueto has sold $11.8M in shares near 52-week lows despite being described as "not selling." FCF declined 1.4% in FY2025 (to $442.6M from $449M) despite revenue growth of 7.5%, suggesting the operating leverage narrative is less robust than claimed. The stock beat Q4 by a wide margin (EPS $2.83 vs $2.36 consensus) yet barely moved -- the market is telling us something. My independent FV estimate: **$155-170**, implying current price ($154) is approximately fairly valued, not 32% undervalued. The thesis's QS of 80 is defensible but its FV needs a significant downward revision.

**SCORING: 13/19 -- STRONG counter-arguments. FV likely needs reduction of 15-25%.**

## Asunciones Clave Desafiadas

### 1. Fair Value of $205 (Weighted OEY + DCF)

- **Thesis claim:** Weighted FV of $205 ($210 OEY, $197 DCF), providing 32% MoS at $155.
- **Evidencia en contra:**
  - My independent DCF at 7% growth, 10% WACC, 2% terminal = **$158.62 base**, $127.18 bear. At these more conservative but defensible inputs, MoS is +3% base and -17% bear -- essentially fairly valued.
  - The thesis uses 9% growth, but FY2025 organic growth was **8.0%**, and Q4 consensus growth was only **6.2%** revenue growth. The trajectory is decelerating: FY2024 +11.6%, FY2025 +7.5% reported (8.0% organic). Using 9% forward growth requires growth to RE-ACCELERATE, which the thesis does not adequately justify.
  - The OEY method producing $210 FV involves choosing a 3.5% "required OEY" which implies the market should give MORN a 29x Owner Earnings multiple. This is generous for an 8% grower with 18.5% operating margins. The thesis's own "conservative" 4.5% OEY gives $186 -- much more realistic.
  - WACC of 9.5% is reasonable by the tool's calculation, but the thesis does not stress-test with 10-10.5% WACC despite beta of 1.08 and current risk-free rate of 4.5%.
  - At 6% growth / 10.5% WACC / 2% terminal (my stressed case): DCF FV = **$141.81** -- 8% BELOW current price.
  - **Peer comparison has a fatal flaw:** The thesis compares MORN P/E (18x) to SPGI (37x), MSCI (42x), FDS (30x). But SPGI has 47% operating margins vs MORN's 18.5%, and MSCI grows at 15% vs MORN's 8%. On PEG basis: MORN PEG 2.25 vs SPGI PEG 2.64 -- the "massive discount" shrinks to a 15% gap, which is justified by MORN's half-peer operating margins.
- **Severidad:** **HIGH**
- **Resolucion sugerida:** Reduce FV to $155-170 range. Use 7-8% growth (not 9%), 10% WACC (not 9.5%). Weight DCF 60% / OEY 40% with conservative OEY (4.5%, not 3.5%).

### 2. Revenue Growth 9% (Thesis Projection)

- **Thesis claim:** 8-10% organic growth sustainable, driven by PitchBook, Credit, and pricing power.
- **Evidencia en contra:**
  - FY2025 organic growth was 8.0%, decelerating from 11.6% in FY2024.
  - Morningstar Direct Platform (largest segment by revenue) grew only **5.4%** in FY2025 -- below the thesis's 8% consolidated assumption.
  - PitchBook growth moderated to **8.6%** for FY2025, down from double-digits previously. "Continued softness in the corporate client segment, especially among smaller firms" cited in Q3. BlackRock's $3.2B acquisition of Preqin (March 2025) creates a well-funded competitor with access to BlackRock's institutional distribution.
  - DBRS Credit grew 21.7% in FY2025, but this is the segment most exposed to **cyclical credit issuance** and **ratings shopping risk** (see below). In a credit downturn, issuance volumes decline and DBRS revenue could contract 15-25%.
  - Sustainalytics is in **structural decline**, with $84B in ESG fund outflows in 2025 (first-ever annual net redemptions since Morningstar began tracking). Anti-ESG US administration is structural, not cyclical.
  - Morningstar Wealth revenue **declined 2.0%** reported in FY2025, with the US TAMP wind-down creating ongoing transition costs.
  - Full-year revenue was $2.4B. At 7% growth (my estimate), 2026E would be $2.57B; at the thesis's 8%, $2.59B. The difference matters compounding over 5 years.
- **Severidad:** **MODERATE**
- **Resolucion sugerida:** Use 7% forward growth (between thesis 9% and bear 6%), reflecting decelerating trajectory and segment-level headwinds.

### 3. QS 80 Tier A (Adjusted from 83 Tool)

- **Thesis claim:** QS Tool 83, adjusted to 80 (Tier A). Adjustment: -3 for Market Position (0/8 default, assigned 5/8 manually).
- **Evidencia en contra:**
  - The QS adjustment is actually UPWARD not downward in Market Position: 0/8 default + 5 manually = net +5 to 88, then -8 (removing default 0 which doesn't matter since 0 was the default), so net adjustment is 83 + 5 - 8 = 80. The math checks out but the reasoning is confusing.
  - Our adversarial review pattern (Sessions 48-53) found 14/16 positions had inflated QS by avg +10-12 points. The fundamental-analyst's QS 80 is only 3 below tool (83), so the inflation risk is lower here than historical average.
  - However, some concerns with the underlying QS tool score of 83:
    - **EPS CAGR 24.3% scores 10/10** -- but this is from a 2022 TROUGH of $1.65 EPS (investment year). Normalized EPS CAGR from 2021 ($4.50) to 2024 ($8.64) = 24%, still high, but this includes a massive margin recovery that is not repeatable. Forward EPS growth will be much lower (8-12%).
    - **ROIC persistence scores 5/7** (3/4 years above WACC). But 2022 ROIC was only 4.1% (well below WACC). The tool only has 4 years of data, and one of them shows ROIC failure. Longer-term, ROIC has been above WACC, but the 2022 example shows vulnerability during investment periods.
    - **FCF Margin scores 8/10 at 19.7%** -- but FY2025 FCF was $442.6M on $2.4B revenue = **18.4%**, down from 19.7% in 2024. FCF DECLINED 1.4% year-over-year despite 7.5% revenue growth. This is the opposite of operating leverage.
    - **Known tool bias: market_position default = 0/8** for ALL companies (documented in decisions_log.yaml). The 5/8 manual adjustment is reasonable for #3-5 position, but could argue for 3-4/8 given Bloomberg/SPGI/MSCI dominance.
  - Net assessment: QS 80 is defensible. I would put it at 76-80, still Tier A but low-end.
- **Severidad:** **LOW**
- **Resolucion sugerida:** QS 80 is acceptable. No tier reclassification needed. But acknowledge FCF margin decline and EPS CAGR inflated by base effects.

### 4. CRSP Acquisition -- Material Omission from Thesis

- **Thesis claim:** The thesis does NOT MENTION the $365M CRSP acquisition completed Feb 2, 2026, ten days before the analysis.
- **Evidencia en contra:**
  - This is a **material governance event** that creates structural conflicts of interest at the core of Morningstar's brand value proposition. Morningstar now simultaneously: (a) owns CRSP indexes benchmarking $3.2T in assets, (b) rates funds tracking those indexes via star ratings, and (c) sells data/analytics to the same fund companies.
  - RIABiz documented the conflict extensively (Oct 2025). Observer Scott MacKillop: "The issue is whether Morningstar would provide more favorable analytic treatment to its CRSP customers in order to keep them happy."
  - **97% of CRSP AUM ($3.1T of $3.2T) is in Vanguard funds.** Single-client concentration risk. If Vanguard in-sources or switches indexes (it has a history of cost-cutting and in-sourcing), the $365M acquisition could require write-down.
  - The deal adds $365M in goodwill to the balance sheet and was financed with a five-year term facility, increasing ND/EBITDA from the current 0.9x.
  - Morningstar has NOT finalized policies on whether it will continue rating CRSP-benchmarked funds.
  - This is comparable to S&P Global both rating debt and providing indices -- but S&P has been doing this for decades with institutional acceptance. Morningstar's specific brand as "independent, impartial third-party" makes the conflict more acute.
  - The risk-identifier (R1) correctly flagged this as the #1 risk. The thesis should have addressed it.
- **Severidad:** **HIGH**
- **Resolucion sugerida:** The thesis MUST be updated to include CRSP analysis before committee approval. Add kill condition: regulatory investigation into ratings objectivity related to CRSP = EXIT.

### 5. Insider Selling -- Thesis Misrepresents Insider Activity

- **Thesis claim:** "Insider selling massive: NO" and "Kapoor not selling" and "45% insider ownership."
- **Evidencia en contra:**
  - Joe Mansueto (Chairman, 45% owner) sold **$11.8M+ in shares** in Q4 2025/Q1 2026:
    - Feb 4-6, 2026: 20,066 shares at $168-188 (~$3.7M)
    - Feb 10, 2026: 3,214 shares at $162.84 (~$523K)
    - Nov 2025: 10,761+ shares (~$2.3M)
    - Aug 2025: 52,000+ shares at $258-265 (~$13.5M)
  - Total 2025-2026 selling exceeds **$30M** across the year. Under a 10b5-1 plan adopted Nov 2024 when stock was above $300, so these are pre-planned, automatic sales.
  - **Mitigant:** 10b5-1 plans are common for insiders with concentrated positions. Mansueto still owns ~45% ($2.8B+ at current prices). $30M in annual sales is <1% of his holding. This is routine portfolio management, not a signal of loss of confidence.
  - **However:** The thesis stating "Kapoor not selling" while ignoring that the FOUNDER AND 45% OWNER is selling $30M/year is misleading. It is technically true (CEO Kapoor is not selling) but substantively incomplete.
- **Severidad:** **MODERATE**
- **Resolucion sugerida:** Update thesis to acknowledge Mansueto selling under 10b5-1. Not a kill condition, but the characterization of "insider selling: NO" is inaccurate and should be corrected.

### Negocio

| # | Desafio | Evidencia | Severidad |
|---|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | CRSP acquisition creates structural conflict of interest threatening brand moat | $3.2T in Vanguard assets benchmarked to CRSP indexes that MORN now owns, while simultaneously rating those funds. RIABiz Oct 2025 documented conflict. Policies not finalized. | HIGH |
| 2 | PitchBook faces well-funded competition from BlackRock/Preqin ($3.2B acquisition) and S&P Capital IQ | BlackRock completed Preqin acquisition Mar 2025 for $3.2B. S&P Global responded with With Intelligence acquisition. PitchBook growth decelerated to 8.6% FY2025. | MODERATE |
| 3 | Sustainalytics in structural decline (not cyclical) | $84B ESG fund outflows in 2025, first-ever annual net redemptions. Anti-ESG US administration is structural. Only 26% of ESG indexes outperformed non-ESG equivalents in 2025. | LOW |
| 4 | AI disruption of information services is accelerating | Feb 3, 2026: Anthropic AI plug-in triggered $285B sector sell-off. Information services stocks (Thomson Reuters -18%, Gartner -30%) hit hard. AI is becoming a direct SUBSTITUTE, not just a complement. | MODERATE |
| 5 | DBRS ratings shopping creates reputational and regulatory risk | Bloomberg Feb 2, 2026: DBRS dominated 111 single-rated Canadian bond deals in 2025 (more than previous 2 years combined). DBRS ratings average one full notch higher than Big 3. Regulators warning about ratings shopping. | MODERATE |
| 6 | Morningstar Wealth is a drag on margins | Wealth revenue declined 2.0% reported FY2025. US TAMP wind-down has transition costs ($4.4M in Q3). Operating margin only 6.8%. ~10% of revenue barely breaking even. | LOW |

### Valoracion

| # | Desafio | Evidencia | Severidad |
|---|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | FV of $205 is overstated by 20-30% | Independent DCF at 7%/10%/2% = $158.62 base. Stressed DCF at 6%/10.5%/2% = $141.81. OEY at 3.5% OEY assumes 29x OE multiple -- generous for 8% grower with 18.5% op margins. | HIGH |
| 2 | 9% growth assumption requires RE-ACCELERATION vs FY2025 actuals of 7.5%/8.0% organic | FY2024 +11.6%, FY2025 +7.5% reported, Q4 consensus was 6.2%. Thesis needs growth to reverse a decelerating trend. | HIGH |
| 3 | P/E comparison to peers is flawed -- does not adjust for margin/growth differentials | MORN PEG 2.25 vs SPGI 2.64 (only 15% gap). MORN operating margins 18.5% vs SPGI 47%, MSCI 55%. The P/E discount is justified by inferior profitability. | MODERATE |
| 4 | EPS may be at/near peak; 2022 trough inflates the recovery trajectory | EPS went from $1.65 (2022 trough) to $8.64 (2024) = 424% increase in 2 years. This margin recovery is not repeatable. FCF DECLINED 1.4% in FY2025 despite revenue growth, suggesting operating leverage is plateauing. | MODERATE |
| 5 | Bear case FV of $148 may be optimistic -- stressed DCF gives $114-142 | At 6%/10.5%/2%: bear = $114.39, base = $141.81. The thesis's bear case at 7%/10.5%/2% = $127.18. Even $127 is well below current $154. | MODERATE |
| 6 | FCF declined YoY in FY2025 ($442.6M vs $449M) despite revenue growth | Operating cash flow decreased 0.3% in FY2025. Increases in income tax and bonus payments offset higher earnings. This contradicts the "operating leverage" narrative. | MODERATE |

### Riesgos

| # | Desafio | Evidencia | Severidad |
|---|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | CRSP completely omitted from thesis -- material governance risk not addressed | $365M acquisition closed Feb 2, 2026, ten days before thesis. Creates conflicts at core of brand value. Risk-identifier flagged as #1 risk. | HIGH |
| 2 | Insider selling misrepresented -- Mansueto sold $30M+ in 2025-2026 | Thesis says "insider selling: NO." Mansueto sold 100,000+ shares in past year under 10b5-1 plan. While planned, the omission is misleading. | MODERATE |
| 3 | Q4 earnings beat did NOT move the stock -- market is signaling concerns | EPS $2.83 vs $2.36 consensus (+20% beat), revenue beat by 2.2%. Stock: flat to slightly down ($154 from $155). The market is not buying the growth story at any valuation. | MODERATE |
| 4 | Vanguard concentration -- 97% of CRSP AUM in one client | If Vanguard creates proprietary indexes or switches benchmarks, $55-65M CRSP revenue evaporates and $365M goodwill writes down. Vanguard has history of in-sourcing. | MODERATE |
| 5 | Credit segment cyclicality not adequately addressed | DBRS Credit grew 21.7% in 2025, driven by strong issuance market. In a credit downturn, issuance volumes contract 20-40% and this segment's revenue follows. The thesis projects steady 8% total growth without stress-testing credit cyclicality. | MODERATE |
| 6 | AI disruption probability understated by thesis (30%) -- should be 35-45% | Feb 2026 Anthropic sell-off wiped $285B from information services. Gartner guided 0% growth for 2026 citing "much tougher selling environment." AI is moving from complement to substitute faster than thesis acknowledges. | MODERATE |

### Timing

| # | Desafio | Evidencia | Severidad |
|---|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Stock at 52-week low in a sector-wide AI sell-off -- catching a falling knife | Information services stocks declined 5%+ in first 2 weeks of Feb 2026. MORN down 24.7% in past month. Sector headwind may continue. | MODERATE |
| 2 | No catalysts for near-term re-rating after Q4 beat failed to move stock | Next catalyst: Q1 2026 earnings (late April/May). CRSP integration uncertainties. Broader AI disruption fear may persist. | LOW |
| 3 | CRSP integration adds execution risk in next 12 months | $365M deal just closed. Integration costs, policy decisions on fund ratings conflicts, Vanguard relationship management. Management attention divided. | LOW |

## Conflictos con Otros Analisis

### Risk-Identifier vs Thesis (MAJOR CONFLICT)

The risk-identifier (R1) flagged the CRSP acquisition conflict as the **#1 risk** and noted it was "NOT MENTIONED IN THESIS." This is a significant gap. The risk-identifier also correctly identified:
- Mansueto insider selling ($11.8M) -- thesis claimed "NO" insider selling
- EPS peak risk -- thesis frames 18x P/E as "cheap" without adequately stress-testing normalized earnings
- Bear case FV may be optimistic

The risk assessment's conclusions directly conflict with the thesis's optimistic framing on these points.

### Moat-Assessor vs Thesis (MINOR CONFLICT)

The moat-assessor rates network effects as MODERATE (3/5), while the thesis labels them "WIDE." The moat-assessor also emphasizes the operating margin gap vs peers more than the thesis does (18.5% vs peer 35-42%). Both agree on WIDE moat overall, but the moat-assessor's nuances are important.

### Independent Valuation vs Thesis (MAJOR CONFLICT)

## Veredicto Global

| Metric | Valor |
|--------|-------|
| Desafios HIGH/CRITICAL | **5** of 21 |
| Desafios no resueltos por thesis | **7** (CRSP omission, insider selling misrepresentation, growth deceleration understated, FV overstatement, FCF decline ignored, PEG-adjusted peer comp, Q4 non-reaction) |
| Veredicto | **STRONG COUNTER** |

### Counter-Argument Scoring: 13/19

| Category | Score | Max | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Business Quality Challenges | 3 | 5 | CRSP conflict is real but MORN's core moat (switching costs, brand in advisor segment) remains intact. AI risk is medium-term. Business IS quality -- the challenges are at the margin. |
| Valuation Challenges | 5 | 5 | FV of $205 is materially overstated. Independent DCF gives $158 base. Growth decelerating. FCF declined YoY. PEG-adjusted peer discount is only 15%, not "massive." |
| Risk Identification Gaps | 3 | 5 | CRSP omission is serious. Insider selling mischaracterized. But risk-identifier caught most of these. The system worked -- the thesis just didn't incorporate them. |
| Timing Challenges | 2 | 4 | Sector-wide AI sell-off creates catching-falling-knife risk. No near-term catalysts after Q4 beat failed. But timing is inherently uncertain for value investors. |

### Interpretacion:

**STRONG COUNTER:** The thesis identifies a genuine quality business but materially overstates fair value. The $205 FV should be revised to **$155-170**. At $154 current price, MORN is approximately **fairly valued**, not offering the 32% MoS the thesis claims. The CRSP acquisition omission is a material gap that must be addressed. The 7 unresolved desafios require investigation before committee approval.

This does NOT mean MORN is a bad investment -- it means the entry price needs to be lower. At the thesis's original target of **$145**, MoS would be 7-17% vs my FV range, which is acceptable for a Tier A compounder (precedent: ADBE 31%, NVO 38% -- both with higher MoS, but those were also more confident thesis with wider moats).

## Recomendacion al Investment Committee

1. **DO NOT approve BUY at current $154.** MoS is inadequate vs adversarial FV of $155-170.
2. **Revise FV downward** to $160-170 range using 7% growth, 10% WACC, 2% terminal.
3. **Set standing order at $130-135** (MoS 18-23% vs $160 FV). This provides:
   - Adequate MoS for a Tier A compounder with some uncertainty
   - Price discipline vs the sector-wide AI sell-off that may push the stock lower
   - Consistency with precedent: we held cash rather than deploying into insufficient MoS (lesson from HRB ADD)
4. **Require thesis to address CRSP acquisition** before approval. Add kill condition for regulatory investigation into ratings objectivity.
5. **Correct insider selling characterization** -- Mansueto selling $30M/year is not "NO insider selling."
6. **Monitor DBRS ratings shopping dynamic** -- if regulatory scrutiny emerges, this is a material headwind.
7. **Acknowledge Q4 non-reaction** -- strong beat, no stock movement. Investigate what the market sees (likely: growth deceleration + AI disruption concern + CRSP integration risk).

### Independent Fair Value Estimate

| Method | FV | Weight | Weighted |
|--------|-----|--------|----------|
| DCF (7%/10%/2%) | $158.62 | 60% | $95.17 |
| OEY (4.5% required) | $186 | 20% | $37.20 |
| EV/EBIT (20x normalized $400M EBIT) | $155 | 20% | $31.00 |
| **Weighted FV** | | 100% | **$163** |

MoS at $154: +6% (insufficient for BUY)
MoS at $145: +12% (borderline)
MoS at $135: +21% (adequate for Tier A with CRSP uncertainty)
MoS at $130: +25% (good entry)

### Recommended QS Adjustment

**QS 80 is defensible.** I would not adjust further. The thesis's -3 adjustment (from 83 tool to 80) appropriately accounts for market position. The FCF decline and EPS base effects are real but do not warrant a tier reclassification. QS range: 76-80, Tier A (low-end).

## META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres
- **CRSP conflict severity:** I may be overweighting this risk. S&P Global has operated with similar conflicts (rating debt and providing indices) for decades without material brand damage. The financial industry may accept Morningstar's "Chinese walls" approach. However, MORN's specific brand as "independent, impartial third party" makes this more acute than for S&P.
- **AI disruption timeline:** I assign higher probability (35-45%) than the thesis (30%) but the ACTUAL disruption timeline for curated financial data is genuinely uncertain. AI may enhance MORN's products more than it threatens them in the 3-5 year horizon. The Feb 2026 Anthropic sell-off may be overdone.
- **Growth re-acceleration possibility:** I am projecting 7% forward growth based on FY2025's 7.5% reported. But CRSP adds incremental revenue ($55-65M), and Credit may continue at 20%+ growth. It is possible FY2026 organic growth comes in at 8%+, which would support a higher FV.
- **FCF decline interpretation:** The FY2025 FCF decline was driven by higher tax and bonus payments, not fundamental deterioration. This may be a one-time effect. If FY2026 FCF rebounds to $500M+, the operating leverage narrative strengthens.

### Limitaciones de Este Analisis
- I could not access the Morningstar Q4 earnings call transcript to hear management's forward guidance and tone. This would have been valuable for assessing growth trajectory and CRSP integration plans.
- I do not have segment-level Q4 data beyond headline numbers. PitchBook Q4 growth and Credit Q4 growth would help assess trajectory.
- Morningstar does not disclose customer retention/churn rates, making the switching cost assessment reliant on inference from license revenue growth rates.
- The EV/EBIT method is rough -- I used a 20x multiple on estimated normalized EBIT without full segment-level normalization.

### Sugerencias para el Sistema
- **Insider selling should be a STANDARD CHECK** in the fundamental-analyst's process. The thesis template should require recent Form 4 filings review, not just ownership level. This has been a recurring issue (ROP CEO also a net seller).
- **Acquisition analysis should be mandatory** when a material acquisition occurred within 90 days of the analysis date. The CRSP omission is a process failure, not just an analyst oversight.
- **PEG ratio as sanity check:** When comparing P/E multiples to peers, the thesis should ALWAYS include PEG ratios to normalize for growth differences. A lower P/E with lower growth is not necessarily cheaper.

### Preguntas para Orchestrator
1. Given the STRONG COUNTER verdict with $163 FV (vs thesis $205), should we set a standing order at $130-135 or defer entirely pending thesis revision?
2. The CRSP acquisition conflict is the biggest unresolved issue. Should the fundamental-analyst be asked to revise the thesis to address this before R4 (investment-committee)?
3. The Q4 beat-but-no-move pattern is concerning. Should we monitor for 2-3 more trading sessions to see if the stock stabilizes or continues declining before setting any standing order?
4. MORN is in the same information services sector hit by the Anthropic AI sell-off. Should we wait for the sector-wide sentiment to stabilize, or is this a contrarian entry opportunity?
