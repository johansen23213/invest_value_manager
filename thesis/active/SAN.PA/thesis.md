## SECTION A: BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING (Framework v2.0)

### A.1 Business Model

**What problem does Sanofi solve?**
Sanofi addresses critical unmet medical needs in immunology, rare diseases, vaccines, and oncology. Core value proposition: life-extending/improving therapies for chronic conditions (atopic dermatitis, asthma, rare enzyme disorders).

**How does it make money?**
| Revenue Type | % of Total | Characteristics |
|--------------|------------|-----------------|
| Consumables (Biopharma) | ~85% | Repeat prescriptions, high switching costs |
| Vaccines | ~15% | Seasonal (flu), pediatric schedules, boosters |

**Revenue is highly recurring:** Chronic disease patients (Dupixent) remain on therapy for years/decades. Rare disease patients (Fabrazyme, Cerezyme) are lifetime customers.

### A.2 Unit Economics

| Metric | Value | Commentary |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Gross Margin | 72.3% | Excellent; biologics command premium pricing |
| Operating Margin | 12.3% | Compressed by R&D investment (25+ P3 trials) |
| Net Margin | 16.7% | IFRS depressed by one-offs; Business basis ~18-20% |
| FCF Conversion | ~125% | Strong; FCF EUR 8.1B vs Net Income EUR 6.4B |
| R&D as % Revenue | ~15% | Industry standard for big pharma |
| Capex as % Revenue | ~5% | Asset-light relative to revenue |

**LTV/CAC Analysis (not traditional but relevant):**
- "Customer acquisition" = regulatory approval + physician adoption
- CAC = R&D investment per successful drug ($1-2B industry average)
- LTV = peak sales x patent life (Dupixent: ~EUR 100B+ cumulative through 2033)
- Implied LTV/CAC: >10x for successful drugs like Dupixent

### A.3 Why Is It Cheap? (CRITICAL)

**Market Narrative (what the market believes):**
1. [X] **Dupixent patent cliff (2031-2033):** ~36% of revenue at risk
2. [X] **Sector rotation:** European pharma out of favor vs US tech
3. [ ] **Margin pressure:** R&D investment temporarily compressing operating margin
4. [ ] **Guidance concerns:** "High single digit" growth may disappoint vs peers

**My Contra-Thesis:**

| Market Believes | I Believe | My Evidence | P(I'm Wrong) |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Dupixent cliff = disaster | 5-7 years runway + diversified pipeline | EUR 22B target by 2030, 25+ P3 readouts, ALTUVIIIO already >$1B | 20% |
| EU pharma is dying | EU pharma is undervalued vs US peers | P/E 9x vs peers 13-16x for similar quality | 25% |
| Low growth ahead | Growth continues 6-8% on business EPS basis | FY25 business EPS +15%, guidance "high single digit" | 30% |

### A.4 Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | Status | Commentary |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Industria en declive secular | NO | Pharma growing with aging demographics |
| Disrupcion tecnologica inminente | NO | Biologics ARE the disruption; Sanofi is on right side |
| Management destruyendo valor | NO | Hudson delivered: Opella divestiture, focused strategy |
| Balance deteriorandose | NO | Debt/Equity 0.28x, FCF EUR 8B, buybacks |
| Insider selling masivo (>5% 12m) | NO | No material selling |
| Dividend cut reciente o probable | NO | 26 consecutive years of increases |
| Perdida market share >2pp 3y | NO | Dupixent gaining share; leader in immunology |
| ROIC < WACC ultimos 3 anos | NO | ROIC ~10-12% vs WACC 8% |
| FCF negativo >2 anos | NO | FCF positive 5+ years (EUR 5.9-8.5B annually) |
| Goodwill >50% equity | MONITOR | High goodwill typical for pharma; no impairment signals |

**RESULT: 0/10 factors YES. NOT a value trap. PASS.**

### A.5 My Informational Advantage

- [X] **Longer time horizon:** Market focuses on 2031 cliff; I see 5-7 years of growth runway
- [X] **Behavioral over-reaction:** 28% below 52w high on sentiment, not fundamentals
- [ ] **Sector expertise:** N/A
- [X] **Quantitative analysis:** DCF + DDM multi-method vs single P/E focus

## SECTION B: PROJECTION FRAMEWORK (Framework v2.0)

### B.1 Revenue Growth Derivation

**TAM Analysis:**
- Global pharmaceutical market: ~$1.6T (2025), growing 5-6% annually
- Immunology TAM: ~$100B, growing 8-10% (Dupixent's core market)
- Rare disease TAM: ~$40B, growing 6-8%
- Vaccines TAM: ~$80B, growing 4-5%

**Market Share:**
- Dupixent: #1 in IL-4/IL-13 pathway, ~70% share in atopic dermatitis
- Vaccines: #3-4 globally, stable share
- Rare Disease: #1-2 in enzyme replacement therapies

**Revenue Growth Formula:**
```
Revenue Growth = TAM Growth + Delta Market Share + Pricing Power
Biopharma: 5% TAM + 1% share gain + 2% pricing = ~8%
Vaccines: 4% TAM + 0% share + 1% pricing = ~5%
Blended (85/15): ~7%

Conservative estimate: 6% (years 1-5), 3% (years 6-10, post-cliff)
```

### B.2 Margin Projection

| Metric | FY2025 | FY2026E | FY2030E | Commentary |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|------------|
| Gross Margin | 72.3% | 72% | 71% | Stable; biologics maintain premium |
| Operating Margin | 12.3% | 15% | 18% | R&D leverage as pipeline matures |
| FCF Margin | 17.4% | 18% | 20% | Improving cash conversion |

### B.3 WACC Derivation

```
Risk-Free Rate (EUR 10Y Bund): 2.4%
Equity Risk Premium: 5.5% (conservative)
Beta: 0.65 (pharma typical; yfinance 0.37 too low due to defensive nature)
Cost of Equity (Ke) = 2.4% + 0.65 x 5.5% = 5.98%

Cost of Debt (pre-tax): 4.0% (investment grade BBB+/A-)
Tax Rate: 25%
Cost of Debt (after-tax): 3.0%

Capital Structure:
  Market Cap: EUR 97.5B (88.5% weight)
  Net Debt: EUR 12.7B (11.5% weight)

Calculated WACC = (88.5% x 5.98%) + (11.5% x 3.0%) = 5.63%

APPLIED WACC: 8.0% (per investment-rules minimum for established companies)
Rationale: Calculated WACC too low due to defensive beta; 8% provides conservatism
```

### B.4 Scenarios

| Parameter | Bear | Base | Bull |
|-----------|------|------|------|
| FCF Growth Y1-5 | 4% | 6% | 8% |
| FCF Growth Y6-10 | 2% | 3% | 4% |
| Terminal Growth | 1.5% | 2.0% | 2.5% |
| WACC | 9% | 8% | 7.5% |
| Probability | 25% | 50% | 25% |

---

## SECTION C: VALUATION (Multi-Method per Framework v2.0)

### Method 1: DCF (40% weight)

**Inputs:**
- Base FCF: EUR 8.089B (FY2025)
- Growth: 6%/3% (years 1-5/6-10)
- Terminal: 2%
- WACC: 8%
- Net Debt: EUR 12.67B
- Shares: 1.208B

**Results:**
| Scenario | Fair Value | MoS vs Current |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Bear (WACC 9%, growth 4%/2%) | EUR 91.87 | 12.4% |
| Base (WACC 8%, growth 6%/3%) | EUR 129.49 | 37.9% |
| Bull (WACC 7.5%, growth 8%/4%) | EUR 173.59 | 53.7% |

### Method 2: DDM (60% weight)

**Rationale for higher DDM weight:** Sanofi is a dividend aristocrat (26 years consecutive increases). For big pharma with stable dividends, DDM is highly relevant.

**Inputs:**
- Current Dividend: EUR 3.92
- Dividend Growth: 4% (conservative; historical 5%+)
- Required Return: 8% (matches WACC floor)
- Payout Ratio: 97% (high but FCF-covered)

**Gordon Growth Model:**
```
D1 = EUR 3.92 x 1.04 = EUR 4.08
FV = EUR 4.08 / (0.08 - 0.04) = EUR 101.92 (Conservative)
```

| Scenario | r | g | Fair Value |
|----------|---|---|------------|
| Bear | 8% | 4% | EUR 101.92 |
| Base | 8% | 4.5% | EUR 117.04 |
| Bull | 7.5% | 5% | EUR 164.64 |

### Combined Valuation (DCF 40% + DDM 60%)

| Scenario | DCF FV | DDM FV | Combined FV | MoS |
|----------|--------|--------|-------------|-----|
| Bear | EUR 91.87 | EUR 101.92 | **EUR 97.90** | 17.8% |
| Base | EUR 129.49 | EUR 117.04 | **EUR 122.02** | 34.1% |
| Bull | EUR 173.59 | EUR 164.64 | **EUR 168.22** | 52.2% |

**Expected Value (25/50/25):** EUR 127.54
**Margin of Safety vs Expected Value:** 36.9%
**Margin of Safety vs Base:** 34.1%
**Margin of Safety vs Bear:** 17.8%

### Comparison: Original vs v2.0

| Metric | Original (v1.0) | Framework v2.0 | Delta |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| Fair Value Range | EUR 97-107 | EUR 98-168 | Wider range |
| Fair Value Base | EUR 102 | EUR 122 | **+19.6%** |
| MoS at Entry (EUR 79.20) | 19-23% | 35% | Higher |
| MoS Current (EUR 80.45) | 18-22% | 34% | Higher |

**Why v2.0 FV is higher:**
1. Original used 20% haircut on DCF for "model risk" which was arbitrary
2. v2.0 uses proper multi-method weighting (DCF 40% + DDM 60%)
3. DDM with conservative assumptions still yields EUR 102-117
4. 8% WACC is already conservative given low beta

## SECTION D: BUSINESS ANALYSIS DEEP DIVE

### D.1 Moat Assessment: WIDE (Confirmed)

| Moat Source | Evidence | Durability |
|-------------|----------|------------|
| **IP/Patents** | Dupixent protected to 2031; biologics harder to copy | 7-10 years |
| **Regulatory** | FDA/EMA approval = 2-4 year biosimilar lag | 5+ years |
| **Scale (Vaccines)** | 1 of 4 global vaccine manufacturers | 10+ years |
| **Rare Disease** | Orphan designations, specialized distribution | 10+ years |
| **Pipeline Depth** | 25+ P3 readouts 2026; diversified | 5-10 years |
| **KOL Relationships** | Immunology/rare disease leadership | 5+ years |

**ROIC vs WACC (10 years):** ROIC consistently 10-15% vs WACC 8% = economic moat confirmed.

### D.2 Key Risks (Updated)

| Risk | Severity | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Dupixent concentration | HIGH | MEDIUM | EUR 22B runway to 2030; pipeline diversifying |
| Pipeline execution | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | 25+ P3s diversify; strong 2025 track record |
| Pricing/IRA | MEDIUM | LOW-MEDIUM | Biologics less exposed; negotiation not before 2028 |
| FX (EUR/USD) | LOW | MEDIUM | Natural hedging; EUR weakness is tailwind |
| M&A overpayment | MEDIUM | LOW | Bolt-on deals; strong balance sheet |

---

## SECTION E: MACRO FIT (Framework v2.0)

**From world/current_view.md (2026-02-02):**

| Factor | Impact on Sanofi | Assessment |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| Fed/BCE rates | Neutral; not rate-sensitive | OK |
| EU economy | Neutral; pharma is defensive | OK |
| Trump tariffs | Korea pharma tariffs (25%); Sanofi is EU, not directly affected | OK |
| Geopolitics | Low exposure to Iran/China | OK |
| Demographics | Aging population = pharma tailwind | POSITIVE |

**Macro Conclusion:** Pharma is neutral sentiment, reasonable valuation per world view. Sanofi not directly affected by current tariff escalation (Korea focus). Demographics structurally favorable.

## SECTION F: KILL TRIGGERS & PROFIT-TAKING

### Immediate Sell (Thesis Broken)
1. Dupixent safety signal (black box warning, withdrawal)
2. Dividend cut
3. Debt/Equity > 1.0x without strategic rationale
4. Business EPS decline >20% YoY (ex one-offs)

### Review for Sell (Thesis Weakened)
5. Pipeline failure rate >60% in 2026
6. Dupixent growth <10% CER before 2028
7. CEO change (Hudson departure)

### Profit-Taking (per investment-rules v2.0)
| Trigger | Action | Rationale |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Price = EUR 97-98 (80% of Base FV) | Sell 25% | Lock in gains |
| Price = EUR 122 (Base FV) | Sell 50% | Thesis mostly played |
| Price = EUR 168 (Bull FV) | Sell rest | Full value, rotate |

---

## SECTION G: KEY DATES

| Date | Event | Importance |
|------|-------|------------|
| 2026-02-28 | FDA: Dupixent AFRS approval | HIGH |
| 2026-04-27 | FDA: Dupixent CSU children | HIGH |
| 2026-H1 | P3 readouts (amlitelimab, others) | HIGH |
| 2026-05-12 (est.) | Ex-dividend (EUR ~4.10) | MEDIUM |
| 2026-Q2 | Q1 earnings | MEDIUM |

---

## SECTION H: INVESTMENT DECISION RECORD

### Original Decision (2026-01-31)
**BUY** at EUR 79.20 | Conviction: HIGH (8/10)

### Re-Evaluation (2026-02-03)
**STATUS: MAINTAIN** | Conviction: HIGH (8/10)

**Summary:**
- Framework v2.0 valuation is HIGHER than original (EUR 122 vs EUR 102 base)
- MoS improved from 22% to 34% (current price EUR 80.45)
- Value trap checklist: PASS (0/10 factors)
- Macro fit: NEUTRAL-POSITIVE (defensive, not tariff-exposed)
- All thesis elements remain intact

**Action:** No change. Position remains attractive at current levels.

---

## AUTOCRITICA (Framework v2.0 requirement)

**Assumptions:**
- WACC 8% may be conservative given low beta (~0.37)
- 6% FCF growth assumes management guidance minus 20% haircut
- DDM assumes dividend growth sustains 4%+ (payout ratio 97% is high)

**Biases Detected:**
- Possible anchoring to original thesis
- Pharma is in my training data; may overestimate understanding

**Evidence I May Be Ignoring:**
- Market has been pricing Sanofi down for 12+ months; collective wisdom?
- Dupixent concentration is real; 36% of revenue is significant
- Biosimilar erosion could be faster than historical biologics

**Validation:**
- Cross-checked FCF with yfinance (EUR 5.89B 2024 → EUR 8.1B 2025 confirmed)
- WACC derived from first principles (Rf + Beta x ERP)
- Multi-method valuation reduces single-method error
