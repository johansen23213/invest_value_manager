## 1. Business Overview

Sanofi is a global top-5 pharmaceutical company headquartered in Paris, France, with a market capitalization of approximately EUR 96 billion. The company operates across three segments:

- **Biopharma (Specialty Care + General Medicines):** The core engine, anchored by Dupixent (dupilumab), the world's leading immunology drug with EUR 15.7 billion in FY2025 sales (+25.2% CER). Specialty Care also includes rare disease franchises (Fabry, Gaucher, Pompe) and oncology.
- **Vaccines:** A global leader in influenza, pediatric combination, and booster vaccines. Includes Beyfortus (RSV prevention, launched 2023).
- **Consumer Healthcare:** Separated via the Opella transaction in 2024; no longer consolidated.

**FY2025 Key Financials (reported 2026-01-29):**

| Metric | FY2025 | FY2024 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Net Sales | EUR 43,626M | EUR 44,286M* |
| Business EPS | EUR 7.83 | EUR 6.81 |
| Reported EPS (diluted) | EUR 6.40 | EUR 4.55 |
| Free Cash Flow | EUR 8,089M | EUR 5,886M |
| Net Debt | ~EUR 8.6B | EUR 8.6B |
| Dupixent Sales | EUR 15,714M | EUR 13,050M |

*FY2024 includes Opella; like-for-like growth was +9.9% CER in FY2025.

**CEO:** Paul Hudson (since 2019). Has refocused the company on high-growth immunology and rare disease, divested Consumer Healthcare, and accelerated pipeline execution.

## 2. Why We Bought

### 2.1 Valuation: Deeply Discounted vs. History and Peers

Sanofi trades at a forward P/E of 8.9x on FY2026E business EPS of ~EUR 8.94, a level not seen since the 2008-2009 financial crisis. For context:

- **5-year average forward P/E:** ~13-14x
- **Peer average (Roche, Novartis, AstraZeneca, GSK):** 13-16x
- **Trailing P/E (reported):** 19.6x (depressed by one-time items; business EPS-based P/E is far more relevant)
- **EV/EBITDA:** 8.6x (vs. pharma peer median ~11-12x)
- **Price/Book:** 1.35x (book value EUR 58.86/share)
- **Price vs. 52-week high:** -28.6% (52w high: EUR 110.88)

The stock has de-rated due to (a) Dupixent patent cliff concerns (biosimilar entry expected ~2031-2033), (b) sector rotation away from European pharma, and (c) temporary margin pressure from pipeline investment. We believe the market is pricing in an overly pessimistic scenario.

### 2.2 Quality: Score 9/10

| Criterion | Score | Detail |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| ROE >15% consistently | 1/1 | Historically 15-20%+ on business basis; 6.7% IFRS (one-offs depress) |
| FCF positive 5+ years | 1/1 | EUR 5.9-8.5B annually (2021-2025) |
| Debt/Equity <1.0 | 1/1 | 0.28x (very conservative) |
| Dividend 10+ years uncut | 1/1 | 26 consecutive years of increases |
| Wide moat | 1/1 | See Section 3 |
| Revenue stability | 1/1 | Max revenue decline <5% in any recession |
| Management quality | 1/1 | Hudson has delivered on strategy; Opella divestiture, pipeline acceleration |
| Analyst coverage >10 | 1/1 | 23 analysts; consensus "Buy" (1.9/5) |
| Market cap >EUR 10B | 1/1 | EUR 96B |
| Defensive sector | 0/1 | Pharma is defensive but patent cliffs add cyclicality -- 0.5 rounded down |

**Total: 9/10 -- Tier A confirmed. Minimum MoS required: 15%.**

### 2.3 Moat Assessment: WIDE

**Moat sources:**

1. **Intellectual Property / Patents:** Dupixent patent protection through ~2031 (composition of matter) with additional formulation/method patents extending into 2030s. Biosimilar entry is complex (biologic, not small molecule).
2. **Regulatory Barriers:** Biologics require extensive clinical trials for biosimilar approval. FDA/EMA approval processes create 2-4 year lag even after patent expiry.
3. **Scale in Vaccines:** One of only 4 companies globally with full vaccine manufacturing capability. Massive fixed-cost infrastructure that is nearly impossible to replicate.
4. **Rare Disease Franchise:** Orphan drug designations, small patient populations, and specialized distribution create high switching costs. Cerezyme/Fabrazyme have maintained dominance for 20+ years.
5. **Pipeline Depth:** 25+ Phase III readouts expected in 2026. Diversified across immunology, oncology, neurology, rare disease.
6. **Brand/Relationship:** Deep KOL relationships in immunology and rare disease. Dupixent is standard of care across 9+ indications.

**Moat durability:** 7-10 years. Even post-Dupixent patent expiry, the diversified pipeline (amlitelimab, fitusiran, ALTUVIIIO >$1B) and vaccine franchise provide durable competitive advantages.

## 3. Fair Value Estimate

### Method 1: Earnings-Based (Primary)

Using normalized business EPS and conservative peer multiple:

| Scenario | Business EPS | Multiple | Fair Value | MoS at EUR 79.20 |
|----------|-------------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Bear | EUR 8.00 | 10x | EUR 80 | 1% |
| Base | EUR 8.94 | 12x | EUR 107 | 26% |
| Bull | EUR 9.50 | 14x | EUR 133 | 40% |

**Weighted fair value (25/50/25):** EUR 107

### Method 2: DCF (Sanity Check)

Assumptions:
- Starting FCF: EUR 8.1B (FY2025)
- Growth years 1-5: 6% (below management guidance of "high single digit")
- Growth years 6-10: 3% (Dupixent patent cliff impact)
- Terminal growth: 2%
- WACC: 8%
- Net debt: EUR 8.6B
- Shares outstanding: 1,211M

| Year | FCF (EUR M) |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | 8,586 |
| 2 | 9,101 |
| 3 | 9,647 |
| 4 | 10,226 |
| 5 | 10,839 |
| 6 | 11,165 |
| 7 | 11,500 |
| 8 | 11,845 |
| 9 | 12,200 |
| 10 | 12,566 |
| TV | 213,622 |

**PV of FCFs + TV:** EUR 142.6B
**Minus net debt:** EUR 134.0B
**Per share:** EUR 110.6
**With 20% haircut for model risk:** EUR 88.5

### Method 3: Dividend Discount Model

- Current dividend: EUR 3.92
- Dividend growth: 5% (26-year track record of ~5-6% annual increases)
- Required return: 8%

**Gordon Growth Model:** EUR 3.92 * 1.05 / (0.08 - 0.05) = EUR 137

This is optimistic; using 4% growth: EUR 3.92 * 1.04 / (0.08 - 0.04) = EUR 102

### Method 4: Analyst Consensus

- Mean target: EUR 100 (23 analysts)
- Median target: EUR 100
- Range: EUR 85 - EUR 119

### Summary of Fair Value Estimates

| Method | Fair Value | MoS at EUR 79.20 |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Earnings-based (weighted) | EUR 107 | 26% |
| DCF (haircut applied) | EUR 88.5 | 10% |
| DDM (conservative) | EUR 102 | 22% |
| Analyst consensus | EUR 100 | 21% |

**Our estimate: EUR 97-107 (midpoint EUR 102)**
**Margin of Safety at entry: 19-23%**
**Tier A minimum (15%): SATISFIED**

## 4. Key Risks

### 4.1 Dupixent Concentration Risk (HIGH)
- Dupixent represents ~36% of total sales and a disproportionate share of profits.
- Patent cliff expected 2031-2033. Biosimilar erosion could be 30-50% of peak sales within 3 years of entry.
- **Mitigation:** Management targets EUR 22B Dupixent sales by 2030 (runway before cliff). Pipeline diversification is accelerating. New launches (ALTUVIIIO, Beyfortus, Kevzara) already contributing EUR 3.9B.

### 4.2 Pipeline Execution Risk (MEDIUM)
- 25 Phase III readouts in 2026 is ambitious. Clinical failures are inherent to pharma.
- Key binary events: amlitelimab (atopic dermatitis), tolebrutinib (neurology -- now under regulatory review).
- **Mitigation:** Diversified pipeline reduces single-program dependence. Track record is strong (10 regulatory approvals in 2025).

### 4.3 Pricing/Regulatory Risk (MEDIUM)
- US drug pricing reform (IRA) could impact Dupixent and future launches.
- European reference pricing pressure.
- **Mitigation:** Biologics less exposed to IRA price negotiation timelines than small molecules. Dupixent negotiation not expected before 2028-2029 at earliest.

### 4.4 FX Risk (LOW-MEDIUM)
- ~40% of revenue in USD, reported in EUR. EUR/USD volatility affects reported results.
- **Mitigation:** Natural hedging through US-based costs. EUR weakness is actually a tailwind.

### 4.5 Acquisition Risk (MEDIUM)
- Sanofi has been actively acquiring (Vicebio $1.2B, Dynavax ~$2.2B). Overpayment risk exists.
- **Mitigation:** Deals are bolt-on, not transformative. Balance sheet is strong (Debt/Equity 0.28x).

### 4.6 Value Trap Risk (LOW-MEDIUM)
- Stock has underperformed for 12+ months. Market may be signaling something we are missing.
- **Mitigation:** Fundamentals (EPS growth, FCF, dividend) do not support value trap thesis. FY2025 results were strong. De-rating appears driven by sentiment, not deterioration.

---

## 5. Kill Triggers (When We Sell)

### Immediate Sell (Thesis Broken)
1. **Dupixent safety signal** -- FDA black box warning or market withdrawal in any indication.
2. **Dividend cut** -- After 26 years of consecutive increases, a cut signals fundamental distress.
3. **Debt/Equity rises above 1.0x** without clear strategic rationale (e.g., transformative acquisition).
4. **Business EPS declines >20% YoY** for reasons other than one-time items.

### Review for Sell (Thesis Weakened)
5. **Pipeline failure rate >60%** of Phase III readouts in 2026 -- signals R&D productivity problem.
6. **Dupixent growth decelerates below 10% CER** before 2028 -- signals earlier-than-expected competitive erosion.
7. **Management change** -- Paul Hudson departure would require reassessment of strategic direction.

### Profit-Taking
8. **Price reaches EUR 100-107** (fair value range) -- review position sizing, consider trimming to 3-4%.
9. **Forward P/E exceeds 14x** -- pharma sector re-rating may present better opportunities elsewhere.

## 7. Investment Decision Record

**Decision:** BUY at EUR 79.20
**Conviction:** HIGH (8/10)
**Time horizon:** 2-4 years (targeting re-rating to fair value + dividend income)

**Expected return breakdown:**
- Multiple expansion (8.9x to 12x): +35%
- EPS growth (6-8% annual): +12-16% over 2 years
- Dividend yield: +5.1% annual
- **Total expected 2-year return: 40-55% (annualized 18-25%)**

**What must go right:**
1. Dupixent continues to grow (>15% CER through 2028)
2. Pipeline delivers at least 2-3 positive Phase III readouts in 2026
3. Market re-rates European pharma closer to historical multiples

**What could go wrong:**
1. Earlier-than-expected biosimilar competition for Dupixent
2. Major pipeline failure reduces growth outlook
3. Sustained sector de-rating of European pharma
