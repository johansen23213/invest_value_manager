## GOVERNANCE RE-EVALUATION UPDATE (2026-02-12)

**Full review:** `thesis/active/LULU/review_feb2026.md`

### Key Findings

| Metric | Original Thesis | Adversarial (Feb 11) | Re-Eval (Feb 12) |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| QS Tool | 82 | 80 | 80 |
| QS Adjusted | 82 | 81 (Tier A) | **78 (Tier A low-end)** |
| Fair Value | $261 | $202 | **$196** |
| MoS at current | 34% | 11.4% | **10.3%** |
| Growth assumption | 8-10% | 5% | 5% (no change) |
| P/E multiple | 20x | 17x | **16x** |
| Conviction | HIGH | LOW-MEDIUM | LOW-MEDIUM |
| Status | HOLD | HOLD LOW-MED | **HOLD PROBATION** |

### Revised Status: **ON PROBATION -- Low-Medium Conviction**

**Why PROBATION (upgrade from clean HOLD):**
- Bloomberg (Feb 11): Employee bonuses tracking below target -- confirms operational underperformance
- Thesis weakened on 3/6 key assumptions (tariffs, governance, cyclical certainty)
- MoS 10.3% is below minimum observed for any Tier A entry in portfolio history
- QS 78 is only 3 points above Tier A/B boundary -- fragile
- Two kill conditions APPROACHING/ELEVATED (global comps, Wilson proxy)

**Why still HOLD (not SELL):**
- ROIC 47% with +37pp spread over WACC -- exceptional, best in portfolio category
- GM 59.2% EXPANDING (all-time high) -- moat intact at financial level
- FCF $1.6B, net cash -- fortress balance sheet
- MoS still positive (+10.3%) -- not overpaying
- No kill conditions triggered
- Position small (3.5%, $343 invested) -- limited risk
- No compelling rotation candidate (OS < 2.0 vs all pipeline)
- Inconsistent with all 8 SELL precedents (all had ROIC<WACC or negative MoS)

### Standing Orders
- **ADD:** SUSPENDED -- no ADD while on probation
- **SELL:** No standing order -- monitor kill conditions
- **Review date:** Mar 31, 2026 (Q4 FY2025 earnings -- MANDATORY)

### Probation Exit Criteria
**UPGRADE to HOLD MEDIUM if Q4 shows:** (a) US comp improvement, (b) GM stable >57%, (c) credible CEO appointed
**SELL if Q4 shows:** (a) negative GLOBAL comps, (b) GM below 57%, or (c) poor CEO appointment

---

## TL;DR

Quality Compounder (QS Tool 80, Adjusted 78, Tier A low-end) cotizando a P/E 12x vs historico 40x. ON PROBATION due to governance chaos (dual activists, no CEO, proxy fight), tariff impact $320M, bonuses below target. Core quality intact (ROIC 47%, GM 59.2%, FCF $1.6B, net cash). MoS 10.3% on revised FV $196. Position small (3.5%). **Mar 31 Q4 earnings is MAKE-OR-BREAK for continued holding.**

## Quality Score

**QS Tool: 80/100 | QS Adjusted: 78/100 -- TIER A (Low-End, Quality Compounder)**

| Categoria | Tool Score | Adjusted | Notas |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Financial Quality** | 35/40 | 35/40 | ROIC spread +37pp, FCF Margin 15%, Net Cash |
| **Growth Quality** | 25/25 | 23/25 | -2: Forward growth 2-5%, EPS declining -11%. Historical CAGR backward-looking. |
| **Moat Evidence** | 17/25 | 17/25 | +3 market position #2, -3 eroding share (30->24%), -1 product quality issues x2, -2 Alo surge |
| **Capital Allocation** | 3/10 | 3/10 | No dividendo, insider 4.6% |
| **TOTAL** | **80/100** | **78/100** | **TIER A (low-end, 3 points above boundary)** |

**Adjustment rationale (quantitative evidence):**
- Growth -2: FY2025 EPS $12.97 vs FY2024 $14.64 = -11.4% decline. Guided FY2026 rev +2-4%.
- Moat net 0 vs tool: Market position +3 (#2 DTC, 21% share) minus competitive erosion -3 (6pp DTC loss in 10 months, Alo surge 8->14%, product quality x2).

### Key Quality Metrics (from quality_scorer.py)
- **ROIC trajectory:** 44.1% -> 37.4% -> 48.9% -> 46.7% (strong, stable)
- **ROIC-WACC spread:** +37.1pp (exceptional)
- **Gross margin trajectory:** 57.7% -> 55.4% -> 58.3% -> 59.2% [Expanding]
- **FCF:** $995M -> $328M -> $1.6B -> $1.6B (positive 4/4 years)
- **Net Debt/EBITDA:** 0.2x (effectively net cash)
- **Revenue CAGR:** +19.2% | EPS CAGR: +25.0%

## Business Understanding

### Modelo de Negocio
Lululemon es retailer de athleisure premium con modelo **Direct-to-Consumer (DTC)**:
- ~90% ingresos via canales propios (stores + ecommerce)
- Pricing premium (~$100+ yoga pants vs $40-60 competidores)
- Vertical integration parcial (diseno propio, manufactura outsourced)
- Comunidad activa (yoga instructors, brand ambassadors)

### Unit Economics
- **Gross Margin 59.2%** (sector 35.0% -- +24.2pp premium)
- **FCF Margin ~15%**
- **Revenue per store** elevado (modelo high-productivity)
- **DTC economics** = no intermediarios, data directa del cliente

### Moat Analysis
1. **Brand Power (#2 en athleisure US)**: 21.2% market share, BUT declining from 30% DTC share to 24% in 10 months
2. **Premium Positioning**: Pricing power demonstrated -- GM +24pp vs sector and EXPANDING
3. **Community/Cult Following**: Brand ambassadors, yoga instructors, eventos locales
4. **Product Innovation**: Fabric technology (Luon, Nulu, Everlux, PowerLu) propietaria -- BUT recent quality issues (Get Low Jan 2026, Breezethrough mid-2025). New "Unrestricted Power" line launched Feb 10 with Lewis Hamilton.
5. **Vertical DTC**: Sin dependencia de terceros, control de experiencia

### Por Que Esta Barata - Narrativa del Mercado
1. **US Growth ha terminado** - Americas comparable sales negative 4+ quarters
2. **Competencia erosiona el moat** - Alo Yoga surged 8% to 14% DTC share in 3 months
3. **Producto se volvio "stale" + quality issues** - Get Low pulled (see-through), Breezethrough pulled
4. **CEO departure + governance chaos** - Two activists (Elliott $1B, Wilson proxy fight), interim co-CEOs, bonuses below target
5. **Tariffs massive** - $320M FY2026 impact on operating income
6. **EPS declining** - FY2025 EPS -11% YoY

### Value Trap Checklist: 1.5/10 -- Low risk

## Conexion Macro

- **Contexto macro**: Late cycle, consumer debil en US pero no recesion
- **Tariffs**: MAJOR headwind - $320M FY2026 impact, affects all sourcing countries
- **Consumer Discretionary**: Sector neutral, selective opportunities in fallen angels
- **Fit**: LULU es consumer cyclical pero con moat premium. Affluent consumers more resilient.
- **CPI Jan (Feb 13)**: If high -> rates higher longer -> consumer pain (negative for LULU)

---

**Conviction:** LOW-MEDIUM
**Status:** ON PROBATION
