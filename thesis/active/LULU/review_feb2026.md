## 1. Quality Score Check

### Tool Output (Feb 12, 2026)
```
QS Tool: 80/100 -- Tier A
  Financial Quality: 35/40 (ROIC spread +37.1pp, FCF margin 15%, ND/EBITDA 0.2x)
  Growth Quality:    25/25 (Rev CAGR +19.2%, EPS CAGR +25%, GM Expanding)
  Moat Evidence:     17/25 (GM +24.2pp vs sector, ROIC persistence 7/7, market position 0/8 manual)
  Capital Alloc:      3/10 (insider 4.6%, no dividend)
```

### QS Adjusted: 78/100 -- Tier A (DOWNGRADE from 80-81)

| Category | Tool | Prior Adj (Feb 11) | New Adj (Feb 12) | Rationale |
|----------|------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| Financial Quality | 35/40 | 35/40 | 35/40 | No change. ROIC 47%, FCF $1.6B, net cash. Strong. |
| Growth Quality | 25/25 | 25/25 | 23/25 | **-2**: Forward growth 2-5%, not 10%+. EPS declining -11%. Historical CAGR is backward-looking. |
| Moat Evidence | 17/25 | 18/25 | 17/25 | **-1**: DTC share 30%->24% (eroding #2). Product quality failures x2. Market position +3 (manual, eroding), competitive pressure -4 (Alo surge, quality incidents). Net: -1 from prior adj. |
| Capital Alloc | 3/10 | 3/10 | 3/10 | No change. 4.6% insider. No dividend. |
| **TOTAL** | **80** | **81** | **78** | **Tier A (low-end)** |

**Adjustment evidence (quantitative, per Session 52 rule):**
- Growth downgrade (-2): FY2025 EPS $12.97 vs FY2024 $14.64 = -11.4% decline. FY2026e EPS $12.50. Revenue growth decelerating from 19% CAGR to guided 2-4%.
- Moat downgrade (-1 net from prior): DTC market share lost 6pp in 10 months (quantified). Bloomberg reports bonuses tracking below target (Feb 11) -- operational underperformance signal. Second product recall in 6 months (Get Low, Jan 2026).

**QS 78 remains Tier A** (threshold 75), but at the low end and approaching the boundary. One more negative quarter or material governance failure could push below 75.

---

## 2. Developments Since Feb 11 Adversarial Review

### NEW developments (last 24-48 hours)

| Development | Date | Impact | Assessment |
|-------------|------|--------|------------|
| **Bloomberg: Employee bonuses tracking below target** | Feb 11 | Negative | Operational underperformance confirmed internally. If bonuses are below target, management KPIs are not being met. This aligns with declining EPS and validates the adversarial concerns. |
| **Unrestricted Power launch** | Feb 10 | Modestly positive | New men's training line with Lewis Hamilton partnership. Demonstrates continued product innovation. Too early for revenue impact assessment. |
| **Stock price declined from $178.90 to $175.86** | Feb 11-12 | Neutral | -1.7% decline, likely Bloomberg bonus news. Still +2.5% from entry. |

### Comprehensive list of MATERIAL changes since thesis (Feb 5)

1. **CEO Calvin McDonald departed** (Jan 31) -- known at thesis time
2. **Dual interim co-CEOs** (Meghan Frank + Andre Maestrini) -- known
3. **Elliott $1B+ stake, pushing Jane Nielsen as CEO** -- known
4. **Chip Wilson proxy fight, 3 board nominees** (Marc Maurer ex-On Holding co-CEO, Laura Gentile ex-ESPN CMO, Eric Hirshberg ex-Activision CEO) -- known
5. **"Get Low" product recall** (see-through complaints, Jan 20) -- known
6. **100 part-time customer service layoffs** (Jan 27) -- known
7. **NEW: Employee bonuses tracking below target** (Feb 11) -- confirms operational underperformance
8. **Tariff impact: $320M estimated for FY2026** -- quantified since thesis
9. **Stock -20% in one month, -56% from 52w high** -- context
10. **Unrestricted Power training line launched** (Feb 10) -- positive product signal

## 3. Value Trap Checklist (10 factors)

| # | Factor | Assessment | Detail |
|---|--------|------------|--------|
| 1 | Industria en declive secular | NO | Athleisure TAM $420-470B, growing 9% CAGR |
| 2 | Disrupcion tecnologica | NO | No tech disruption in apparel |
| 3 | Management destruyendo valor | PARTIAL (0.5) | No permanent CEO. Two uncoordinated activists. Product quality issues. Bonuses below target. BUT: Elliott presence is arguably constructive. |
| 4 | Balance deteriorandose | NO | Net Debt/EBITDA 0.2x. Cash $1.0B. Fortress. |
| 5 | Insider selling masivo | NO | Wilson buying/nominating. Elliott bought $1B+. Net insider/activist buying. |
| 6 | Dividend cut probable | N/A | No dividend to cut |
| 7 | Perdida market share >2pp | **YES** | DTC share 30% -> 24% in 10 months = -6pp. Alo surged 8% to 14%. |
| 8 | ROIC < WACC | NO | ROIC 46.7% >> WACC 9.6%. Spread +37.1pp. Exceptional. |
| 9 | FCF negativo >2 anos | NO | FCF $1.6B positive. 4/4 years positive. |
| 10 | Goodwill >50% equity | NO | Clean balance sheet |

**Result: 1.5/10** -- Low risk of value trap. Market share loss is the only flagged factor.

The ROIC and FCF data strongly argue against value trap. A company generating 47% ROIC with expanding gross margins and $1.6B FCF does not have the profile of a value trap. The market share loss is concerning but at this point is a LEADING indicator -- it has not yet flowed through to margin or FCF deterioration.

## 4. Valuation Update

### DCF Tool Results (Feb 12)

| Scenario | Growth | WACC | Terminal | FV/Share | MoS vs $175.86 |
|----------|--------|------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Bear | 3% | 11.0% | 2.0% | $167.32 | -4.9% |
| **Base** | **5%** | **10.0%** | **2.5%** | **$207.90** | **+18.2%** |
| Bull | 7% | 9.0% | 3.0% | $263.19 | +49.7% |

### Sensitivity Matrix (Growth x WACC)

| Growth \ WACC | 8.5% | 10.0% | 11.5% |
|---------------|-------|-------|-------|
| 2.0% | $229 | $182 | $151 |
| 3.5% | $245 | $195 | $161 |
| **5.0%** | **$262** | **$208** | **$172** |
| 6.5% | $280 | $222 | $183 |
| 8.0% | $299 | $236 | $195 |

Terminal value as % of EV: 71.3% -- HIGH sensitivity to terminal assumptions.

### Method 1: DCF (50% weight) -- FV $208
Growth 5% (reflects 2-4% near-term rising to 6-8% as tariff impact fades + international grows). WACC 10.0% (beta 1.01, Ke 10.1%). Terminal 2.5%.

### Method 2: P/E Normalized (30% weight) -- FV $200
- FY2026e EPS: $12.50 (consensus, reflects tariff impact)
- Applied P/E: 16x (below prior adversarial 17x due to governance complexity)
- Rationale for 16x: DECK trades at 16x with stronger growth. LULU with declining EPS, no CEO, dual activists, and tariff headwind warrants discount to DECK.
- FV = 16x * $12.50 = $200

### Method 3: Bear Floor (20% weight) -- FV $165
- Growth 2% (US flat, international moderates, tariffs persist)
- WACC 11.0%
- P/E bear: 13x * $12.50 = $162.50
- Average of DCF bear ($167) and P/E bear ($163) = $165

### Revised Weighted FV: $196

| Method | Fair Value | Weight | Weighted |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| DCF (5% growth) | $208 | 50% | $104.0 |
| P/E (16x normalized) | $200 | 30% | $60.0 |
| Bear Floor | $165 | 20% | $33.0 |
| **Weighted FV** | | 100% | **$197** |

**Rounding to $196** (using P/E of 16x rather than 17x reflects governance premium demanded).

### FV Bridge from Adversarial ($202 -> $196)

| Factor | Impact | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Governance complexity premium | -$6 | Two uncoordinated activists + no CEO + proxy fight + bonuses below target. P/E multiple deserves discount vs prior 17x assumption. |
| **Total revision** | **-$6 (-3.0%)** | **FV $202 -> $196** |

This is a MODEST revision (-3%). The fundamental business metrics have not changed since Feb 11. What has changed is the governance picture becoming more complex and the Bloomberg bonus report confirming internal operational underperformance.

### Current MoS

**Price: $175.86 | FV: $196 | MoS: +10.3%**

Compared to:
- Original thesis MoS: 34% (at FV $261)
- Post-adversarial MoS: 11.4% (at FV $202)
- Current MoS: 10.3% (at FV $196)

## 5. EXIT Protocol - 6 Gates

### Gate 1: Kill Condition Activated?

| Kill Condition | Status | Assessment |
|----------------|--------|------------|
| GM < 50% | **OK** (59.2%) | Gross margin at all-time high. Strong. |
| 3Q consecutive negative global comps | **APPROACHING** | US negative 4+ quarters. Global still positive via international. FY2026 guidance +2-4% revenue. If Q4 disappoints and FY2026 guide is flat/negative globally, this triggers. |
| FCF negative 2Q | **OK** | FCF $1.6B positive |
| Bad CEO appointment | **PENDING** | No CEO appointed yet. Elliott pushing Jane Nielsen (strong candidate). Wilson pushing board changes. Unknown outcome. |
| Chip Wilson board control | **ELEVATED** | Proxy fight active. 3 nominees. June 2026 AGM. If Wilson gains 3/3 seats AND installs a fundamentally different strategy, this could trigger. Currently pre-vote. |
| DTC channel commoditized | **OK** | Not triggered |
| Chinese brands quality parity | **OK** | Not triggered |

**New proposed Kill Condition #8:** Employee bonuses below target for 2+ consecutive years AND CEO search exceeds 6 months without resolution. Rationale: prolonged operational underperformance combined with leadership vacuum indicates institutional breakdown, not cyclical weakness.

**Gate 1 Verdict: NO kill condition triggered.** Two are elevated/approaching -- monitoring required.

### Gate 2: Thesis Still Valid?

**Original thesis (Feb 5):** "Fallen angel quality compounder. Problems are CYCLICAL (product stale, US weak), NOT structural. International growth compensates. Product refresh Spring 2026 is catalyst. CEO transition manageable."

**Assessment against reality:**

| Thesis Element | Feb 5 Assessment | Feb 12 Assessment | Change |
|----------------|------------------|---------------------|--------|
| Cyclical vs structural | 100% cyclical | 60% cyclical / 40% structural risk | WEAKENED |
| International growth | +33%, China +46% | China decelerating to 20-25%, still positive | INTACT but moderating |
| Product refresh catalyst | 35% newness, Spring 2026 | Get Low failed, Unrestricted Power launched, too early to judge | UNCERTAIN |
| CEO transition | Manageable | Complex: 2 uncoordinated activists, no CEO, proxy fight | WEAKENED |
| Tariff impact | Marginal ~100bp | $320M = 13% of operating income | MATERIALLY WRONG |
| Bonuses/operations | Not assessed | Below target per Bloomberg | NEW NEGATIVE |

**Gate 2 Verdict: Thesis DEBILITADA (weakened), not invalidated.** The core quality metrics (ROIC, GM, FCF) remain exceptional. But three thesis assumptions were wrong (tariff impact, governance complexity, cyclical certainty) and one is negative-new (bonus underperformance).

### Gate 3: MoS Current?

**MoS: +10.3%** (FV $196, price $175.86)

**Is 10.3% MoS sufficient for the current risk profile?**

Reasoning from principles:
- QS 78 Tier A (low-end) -- historically Tier A accepts 10-15% MoS minimum (precedent: ADBE bought at 31%, NVO at 38%, MONY.L at 36%, AUTO.L at 29%, BYIT.L at 35%)
- BUT those entries were all at HIGHER conviction (HIGH) vs LULU current conviction (LOW-MEDIUM)
- 10.3% MoS with LOW-MEDIUM conviction is THIN -- it does not adequately compensate for the elevated uncertainty
- Bear case FV $165 implies -6.2% downside from current price
- If Q4 disappoints or CEO appointment is poor, price could easily reach bear case

**Precedent check (decisions_log.yaml):**
- All Tier A BUYs had MoS 29-38%. LULU is at 10.3%.
- Positions sold had MoS 0% or negative (SAN.PA ~0%, SHEL.L -3.5%, PFE -3.2%)
- LULU sits in between: MoS positive but MUCH lower than any entry point

**Gate 3 Verdict: MoS positive but INSUFFICIENT for current risk level.** Not enough to warrant ADD. Not negative enough to warrant SELL solely on valuation. This is "hold and monitor" territory.

### Gate 4: Better Opportunity? (Opportunity Score)

Comparing LULU vs best pipeline candidates:

| Metric | LULU (current) | PAYC (pipeline) | DSY.PA (approved) | MORN (pipeline) |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| QS | 78 (Tier A low) | 85 (Tier A strong) | 70 (Tier B) | 83 (Tier A) |
| MoS | 10.3% | ~10-15% at $105 | 22.5% at EUR 15.50 | TBD (Q4 today) |
| Conviction | LOW-MEDIUM | MEDIUM (pending R2-R4) | HIGH | TBD |
| Status | ACTIVE POSITION | R1 complete, $105 entry | Standing order approved | Preliminary |

**Opportunity Score vs PAYC:** OS = (10%/10.3%) * (85/78) = 0.97 * 1.09 = 1.06 -- MARGINAL, not compelling for rotation.

**Opportunity Score vs DSY.PA:** OS = (22.5%/10.3%) * (70/78) = 2.18 * 0.90 = 1.96 -- APPROACHING justification but DSY.PA is Tier B vs LULU Tier A.

**Gate 4 Verdict: No compelling rotation candidate today.** PAYC is higher quality but similar MoS. DSY.PA has better MoS but lower quality. Neither produces OS >> 2.0 that would clearly justify selling LULU. The capital in LULU ($343, 2 shares) is small -- the opportunity cost is minimal.

### Gate 5: Dead Money?

- **Holding period:** 7 days (since Feb 5)
- **P&L:** +2.5%
- **Catalysts ahead:**
  - Q4 FY2025 earnings: **Mar 31, 2026** (48 days away) -- CRITICAL
  - CEO announcement: Could happen any day
  - AGM proxy vote: **June 2026** (~4 months away)
  - Unrestricted Power sell-through data: Q1 FY2026

**Gate 5 Verdict: NOT dead money.** Position is only 7 days old. Multiple catalysts in pipeline within 1-4 months. Insufficient time to judge.

### Gate 6: Friction of Exit

- **P&L:** +$8.48 (+2.5%) -- minimal tax impact
- **Commissions:** Negligible on eToro
- **Spread:** Liquid stock, tight spread
- **Portfolio impact:** 3.5% position -- removal would not significantly impact diversification

**Gate 6 Verdict: Low friction.** But this is only relevant if Gates 1-5 supported EXIT. They do not.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment: HOLD with PROBATION

### EXIT Protocol Summary

| Gate | Question | Result | Direction |
|------|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Kill Condition? | NO (2 elevated/approaching) | HOLD |
| 2 | Thesis Valid? | WEAKENED (not invalidated) | HOLD with caution |
| 3 | MoS Current? | +10.3% (thin for risk level) | HOLD, no ADD |
| 4 | Better Opportunity? | No compelling OS > 2.0 | HOLD |
| 5 | Dead Money? | No (7 days, catalysts ahead) | HOLD |
| 6 | Friction? | Low | N/A |

### Decision: HOLD -- ON PROBATION

**Reasoning from Principles:**

**Principle 6 (Selling Requires Argument):** There is no clear argument to SELL today.
- ROIC 47% with +37pp spread -- one of the best in portfolio
- GM 59.2% EXPANDING -- moat intact at financial level
- FCF $1.6B, net cash -- zero financial distress
- MoS +10.3% -- still positive, not overpaying
- No kill condition triggered
- Position small (3.5%, $343 invested)

**Principle 7 (Consistency with Precedents):** In the adversarial program, I sold 8 positions that had:
- ROIC < WACC (TEP.PA, LIGHT.AS, PFE, SHEL.L, A2A.MI, VNA.DE, TATE.L, SAN.PA) -- LULU ROIC is +37pp ABOVE WACC
- MoS negative (SAN.PA ~0%, SHEL.L -3.5%, PFE -3.2%, IMB.L -14.6%) -- LULU MoS is +10.3%
- Thesis invalidated (HRB FCF declining) -- LULU FCF is stable $1.6B

LULU does NOT match ANY of the profiles of positions we sold. Selling now would be inconsistent with established precedent and would require a strong novel argument that I cannot construct from the available evidence.

**Why PROBATION (not clean HOLD):**
1. Thesis has been WEAKENED on 3 of 6 key assumptions (tariffs, governance, cyclical certainty)
2. MoS 10.3% is below the minimum observed for any Tier A entry in our history (29% was lowest)
3. Conviction is LOW-MEDIUM, the lowest for any Tier A position
4. Bloomberg bonus report confirms internal operational challenges
5. Two kill conditions are APPROACHING/ELEVATED
6. Q4 earnings (Mar 31) are MAKE-OR-BREAK for continued holding

**PROBATION means:**
- NO ADD under any circumstances until probation is lifted
- Q4 earnings (Mar 31) is the review date
- If Q4 shows: (a) negative GLOBAL comps, (b) GM deterioration below 57%, or (c) poor CEO appointment -- SELL
- If Q4 shows: (a) US comp improvement, (b) GM stable/expanding, (c) credible CEO appointed -- UPGRADE to HOLD MEDIUM

### Updated Standing Orders

| Action | Price | Condition | Status |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **ADD** | ~~$155~~ | ~~MoS >30%~~ | **SUSPENDED** -- probation means no ADD |
| **SELL** | N/A | Kill condition trigger | ACTIVE -- monitor GM, global comps |

### Conviction: LOW-MEDIUM (unchanged)

### Kill Conditions (Updated)

1. **Gross Margin cae <50%** -- indicates loss of pricing power
2. **3 trimestres consecutive negative global comps** (not just Americas) -- APPROACHING
3. **FCF turns negative 2+ quarters**
4. **CEO appointment clearly wrong** (no retail experience, Wilson-controlled) -- PENDING
5. **Chip Wilson gains board control and implements disruptive changes** -- ELEVATED
6. **DTC channel commoditized** (>25% premium DTC via platforms)
7. **Chinese brands achieve quality parity at 40%+ discount** in Western markets
8. **NEW: Bonuses below target 2+ consecutive years AND CEO search >6 months** -- MONITORING (first data point Feb 11)

### Catalysts to Watch

| Catalyst | Date | Impact if Positive | Impact if Negative |
|----------|------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Q4 FY2025 earnings | Mar 31, 2026 | US comp improvement -> UPGRADE to HOLD MED | Negative global comps -> SELL |
| CEO announcement | Any day | Jane Nielsen (or equivalent) -> UPGRADE | Weak candidate or Wilson pick -> concern |
| Spring 2026 sell-through | Q1 FY2026 | Product refresh working -> thesis validated | Another quality failure -> accelerate EXIT |
| AGM proxy vote | June 2026 | Board stability -> positive | Wilson gains control -> evaluate KC#5 |
| CPI Jan 2026 | Feb 13 | Low inflation -> BoE/Fed cut path -> consumer boost | High -> rates higher longer -> consumer pain |

## 8. Analyst Consensus Context

- 22 analysts cover LULU
- Consensus: HOLD (82% Hold, 9% Buy, 9% Strong Buy)
- Average price target: $213-$227 (range by source)
- Our FV ($196) is BELOW consensus -- we are MORE conservative than Street

This is appropriate given our framework: analysts tend to be optimistic and slow to adjust. Our adversarial-adjusted FV reflects governance premium and tariff reality more aggressively than consensus.

---

## META-REFLECTION

### Changes Detected Since Last Review (Feb 11)
- Bloomberg bonus report (Feb 11) is NEW and confirms operational underperformance internally
- Price declined $175.86 vs $178.90 (-1.7%) -- modest
- Unrestricted Power launch (Feb 10) is modestly positive for innovation narrative
- No CEO announcement yet -- uncertainty persists and increases each day
- QS adjusted downward from 81 to 78 based on more rigorous forward-looking assessment

### Incertidumbres
- Q4 FY2025 results (Mar 31) are the single most important data point and are 48 days away
- CEO search outcome is completely unknown -- could be transformative (positive or negative)
- Tariff landscape could change with trade negotiations -- $320M may be peak or could worsen
- Spring 2026 product refresh sell-through data not yet available
- China growth moderation rate uncertain -- was 46%, moderated to 22%, trajectory unknown
- Whether Wilson and Elliott will coordinate or fight each other is unclear
- Analyst consensus still optimistic ($213-$227) vs our $196 -- who is right depends on execution

### Sugerencias
1. **Update system.yaml** to reflect PROBATION status and revised FV $196
2. **Add LULU to earnings_framework** for Mar 31 Q4 if not already planned
3. **Monitor Alo Yoga DTC share monthly** -- if crosses 18% while LULU drops below 20%, moat thesis weakens
4. **Track CEO search timeline** -- if no announcement by Mar 31 earnings, this becomes a negative signal (5+ months without permanent CEO)
5. **Consider whether QS 78 Tier A low-end should trigger a re-tier to Tier B** at next review if any further deterioration
6. **sector view needs update** -- consumer-discretionary.md still shows LULU QS 82, FV $261, MoS 34%. All stale.

### Alertas para Orchestrator
- LULU is now ON PROBATION with Mar 31 as decisive date
- If Q4 disappoints on global comps or GM, prepare SELL recommendation immediately
- The $343 position ($196 FV, 2 shares) limits total risk to ~$35 in a bear scenario ($175->$165 = -$20)
- Pipeline candidates (PAYC, MORN, DSY.PA) may offer better risk-adjusted returns by March -- monitor
- QS at 78 is only 3 points above Tier B boundary -- fragile classification
