## 3. ESCENARIOS DE EARNINGS

### BEAR (probabilidad 35%)
**FY2026 guidance < $20.00 OR behavioral volumes decline Q4**

Que buscar:
- FY2026 EPS guidance < $20.00 (KC#5 triggered)
- Q4 behavioral health volumes negative YoY (KC#4 approaching)
- Medicaid impact acknowledged as $200M+ revenue headwind 2027
- Labor cost re-acceleration (operating margin compression)
- Management vague/dismissive on OBBBA mitigation

**Implicacion:** Thesis invalidated. Medicaid + volume weakness = structural.
**ACCION: SELL 2 shares. Probation failed. No exceptions.**
**Precio esperado en bear:** $185-200

### BASE (probabilidad 40%)
**FY2026 guidance $20.00-$22.00, Medicaid quantified, volumes flat-positive**

Que buscar:
- Q4 EPS in line ($5.40-5.60)
- FY2026 EPS guidance $20.00-$22.00 (acknowledges Medicaid headwind but manageable)
- Behavioral health volumes flat to +1% Q4 (confirming soft but not declining)
- Medicaid impact quantified ($100-200M by 2028) with mitigation plan
- DOJ/OIG compliance costs disclosed ($15-25M/yr)
- Labor costs stable (no margin compression)

**Implicacion:** Thesis weak but not broken. FV stays $210-220.
**ACCION: MAINTAIN HOLD LOW. Reassess at Q1 2026 earnings (6 months).**
**Sub-scenario:** If guidance $21-22 + volumes positive → UPGRADE to HOLD MEDIUM

### BULL (probabilidad 25%)
**FY2026 guidance > $22.00, behavioral volumes accelerating, Medicaid impact minimal**

Que buscar:
- Q4 EPS > $5.70 (beat)
- FY2026 EPS guidance > $22.00 (Medicaid impact delayed or mitigated)
- Behavioral health volumes > +2% Q4 (re-acceleration)
- Operating margin expanding further (12%+)
- Significant buyback acceleration at current prices
- New facility openings driving growth

**Implicacion:** Market may be too pessimistic on Medicaid timing. FV could be $240+.
**ACCION: UPGRADE to HOLD MEDIUM. Consider ADD at $200 (15% MoS).**

## 5. DATOS CLAVE A EXTRAER DEL CALL

**Prioridad 1 (thesis-determinante):**
1. **FY2026 EPS guidance** — THE most critical number. < $20 = SELL.
2. **Q4 behavioral health volumes** — growth or decline?
3. **Medicaid commentary** — does management quantify OBBBA impact?

**Prioridad 2 (thesis-informativa):**
4. Labor costs trend (% of revenue, nurse/physician wages)
5. Q4 operating margin (continuing expansion or peaking?)
6. Acute care same-store admissions
7. DOJ/OIG compliance update (any new findings by monitor?)

**Prioridad 3 (nice-to-have):**
8. Buyback activity in Q4
9. New facility pipeline (behavioral health expansions)
10. Payer mix shift (commercial vs Medicaid %)
11. Capex outlook FY2026

## 7. MEDICAID IMPACT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL NEW VARIABLE)

**OBBBA (One Big Beautiful Bill Act) — signed Jul 4, 2025:**
- $1T in Medicaid cuts over 10 years
- 11.8M estimated to lose coverage
- Work requirements for non-disabled adults 19-64
- UHS supplemental Medicaid payments: ~$1.2B/yr, expected loss $360-400M by 2032

**What earnings MUST reveal:**
1. Has management quantified the impact? If no → RED FLAG (unprepared)
2. Is there a mitigation plan? (shift payer mix, reduce Medicaid-dependent capacity)
3. What is the timeline? (2027 phase-in vs 2028 full impact)
4. Behavioral health disproportionate impact acknowledged?

**If management does NOT address OBBBA on the call:**
→ This is a negative signal. The market will price in uncertainty.
→ Consider downgrading to SELL regardless of financial results.

## 8. CONTEXT POSITIONING

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Portfolio weight | ~3.7% (2 shares, $403 invested) |
| Price vs FV | **$227 > $213 FV = OVERVALUED** |
| Max downside to bear ($185) | -$84 (-18.6%), portfolio impact -0.8% |
| Opportunity cost | $403 in PAYC/MORN at 25% MoS = better expected return |
| Tier | C (51 QS) — NOT a compounder |
| ROIC-WACC | 1.2pp — minimal value creation |

**The honest assessment:** UHS at $227 is ABOVE our $213 FV. We are holding a Tier C stock above fair value through earnings. The ONLY justification is the information optionality: if earnings are very strong, we avoid selling at what could be a trough. If earnings are weak, we crystallize a 12.8% gain instead of holding into further decline.

**Per Principio 9:** This capital should gravitate toward quality. Post-earnings, unless bull scenario materializes, the default should be EXIT to redeploy into pipeline.
