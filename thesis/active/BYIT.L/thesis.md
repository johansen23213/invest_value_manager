# BYIT.L - Bytes Technology Group plc

**Fair Value:** 345 GBp (adversarial, updated 2026-02-11)

## TL;DR

UK's #1 software value-added reseller (VAR) trading at -48% from 52-week highs due to Microsoft partner incentive restructuring compressing margins. **ADVERSARIAL REVIEW 2026-02-11:** QS downgraded from 81 (Tier A) to 68-72 (Tier B). FV revised from 455 GBp to 345 GBp (-24.2%). HOLD on PROBATION with LOW conviction. Net cash, 30% FCF margin, but insider ownership disputed (0.4-0.5% actual vs 9.6% yfinance), Microsoft EA disintermediation structural not cyclical, and Softcat P/E gap has narrowed from "25x vs 14x" to "17x vs 14x". EXIT if FY2026 full-year OP < GBP 66M.

## Quality Score: Tool 68 / Adjusted 69-72 -- Tier B (Quality Value)

> **ADVERSARIAL UPDATE 2026-02-11:** QS Tool = 68 (Tier B). Thesis claimed 81 (Tier A).
> Five independent agents converge on 65-73 adjusted range. Tier B, not Tier A.

### QS Tool Output (quality_scorer.py)

| Category | Tool Score | Thesis Claimed | Adversarial Adjusted | Notes |
|----------|-----------|---------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Financial Quality** | 25/40 | 28/40 | 25-29/40 | ROIC = N/A (data gap, scored 0/15). FCF margin 10/10, leverage 10/10, consistency 5/5. ROIC adjustment +4 possible if manually verified. |
| **Growth Quality** | 23/25 | 21/25 | 17-19/25 | Historical CAGRs strong, but H1 FY2026 GP +0.4%, OP -7% = forward deterioration. -4 to -6 adjustment. |
| **Moat Evidence** | 10/25 | 22/25 | 14-15/25 | Tool gives 0/8 market position, 0/7 ROIC persistence (data gaps). Independent moat assessment: NARROW (14/25). +4-5 for documented #1-2 market position. |
| **Capital Allocation** | 10/10 | 10/10 | 6-7/10 | Insider ownership DISPUTED: yfinance 9.6% vs Simply Wall St 0.4-0.5%. Former CEO scandal (119 undisclosed trades). -3 to -4. |
| **TOTAL** | **68** | **81** | **68-72** | **Tier B (Quality Value)** |

### Key QS Discrepancies
1. **ROIC data gap** — Tool cannot calculate ROIC for BYIT.L. ROE trajectory: 69%→66%→60%→56% (DECLINING)
2. **Insider ownership** — 9.6% (yfinance) likely includes Altron-era blockholders, not management. Actual exec ownership 0.4-0.5% per Simply Wall St and MarketBeat
3. **Former CEO scandal** — Neil Murphy resigned Feb 2024 over 119 undisclosed share transactions. FCA closed case, no sanctions. CEO is Sam Mudd (not "Sam Sheridan" as previously stated)

**Quality Compounder Checklist:**
- [x] QS >= 75 (81)
- [x] ROIC > WACC consistently
- [x] FCF positive and growing
- [x] Moat identifiable (switching costs, relationships, scale, specializations)
- [x] Sustainable growth (UK IT spending structural tailwind)
- [x] Management with track record (insider ownership 9.6%)
- [ ] No structural disruption imminent -- PARTIAL: Microsoft incentive changes are structural to the margin structure but NOT to the business model itself

**ROIC Spread Note:** The tool calculates 4.9pp, which is lower than typical Tier A. This is because BYIT is an asset-light business and ROIC calculation can be distorted by negative working capital / minimal invested capital. The operating profit / GP margin of 40.7% and FCF margin of ~30% are the more relevant profitability metrics. On those metrics, BYIT is clearly Tier A quality.

## Business Understanding

### What Problem Does Bytes Solve?

Bytes solves the complexity problem for UK organizations (both public and private sector) purchasing, deploying, and managing enterprise software, cybersecurity, and cloud services. Rather than navigating the labyrinth of Microsoft licensing (Enterprise Agreements, CSP, Azure), cybersecurity vendors (CrowdStrike, Palo Alto, etc.), and cloud migration alone, organizations outsource this to Bytes as a trusted intermediary.

This is a **"must-have"** for large organizations: software licensing compliance, cybersecurity posture management, and cloud migration are non-negotiable business requirements. Doing them wrong can result in audit penalties (Microsoft audits are aggressive), security breaches, and failed digital transformation.

### How Bytes Generates Revenue

**Revenue Model: Transaction/Resale + Services (Recurring Growth)**

| Revenue Type | Description | % of Gross Profit | Characteristics |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Software (Licensing)** | Reselling Microsoft, security, and other vendor licenses | ~70% of GP | Transaction-based, gross margins ~5-6% on GII, but highly recurring (annual renewals) |
| **Services** | Cloud migration, managed services, security consulting, AI implementation | ~30% of GP (growing 40%+) | Higher margin, recurring, relationship-deepening |

**Key Distinction:** Bytes reports Gross Invoiced Income (GII) of GBP 2.1B+, but this is a misleading revenue metric. The true economic value is Gross Profit (~GBP 160M FY2025) because the pass-through software costs are just that -- pass-through. Bytes' effective margin is Gross Profit / GII of ~7-8%.

**Recurrence:** ~80%+ of software revenue is recurring (annual license renewals, multi-year Enterprise Agreements). This gives high visibility.

### FY2025 Full Year Results (Year Ended Feb 2025)

| Metric | FY2025 | FY2024 | Change |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Gross Invoiced Income | GBP 2.10B | GBP 1.82B | +15.2% |
| Gross Profit | GBP 160M (est) | GBP 143M | +12.0% |
| Operating Profit | GBP 65M (est) | GBP 55.5M | +17.1% |
| Pre-tax Profit | GBP 74.6M | GBP 61.6M | +21.1% |
| EPS | 22.8p | 19.6p | +16.3% |
| Dividend (total) | 10.0p + 10.0p special | 8.7p | +15% ordinary |
| Op Profit / GP Margin | 40.7% | 38.8% | +1.9pp |

### H1 FY2026 Results (6 Months to Aug 2025) -- The Bad Period

| Metric | H1 FY2026 | H1 FY2025 | Change |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Gross Invoiced Income | GBP 1.342B | GBP 1.230B (est) | +9.1% |
| Gross Profit | GBP 82.4M | GBP 82.1M | +0.4% |
| Operating Profit | GBP 33.1M | GBP 35.6M | **-7.0%** |
| GP/GII Margin | 6.1% | 6.7% | **-0.6pp** |

**What Caused the Decline:**
1. **Microsoft FY26 Partner Incentive Restructuring** -- Microsoft raised revenue thresholds for CSP partners (from ~$300K to $1M TTM), changed incentive eligibility requirements, replaced Customer Adds with Growth Accelerator incentives, and performed retroactive recalculations. This compressed GP/GII margins by 0.6pp.
2. **Public Sector Slowdown** -- Public sector GP growth decelerated to +1.6% (from double-digits) due to more severe impact from Microsoft EA incentive changes.
3. **Corporate Segment Adjustment** -- Corporate GP was -0.6% as new corporate sales structure launched at start of year.

**What Was Good:**
1. **Services Revenue +40%+** -- Services is the higher-margin, higher-value segment and is growing rapidly.
2. **GII Still Growing +9.1%** -- Topline volume growth remains strong.
3. **Management Guidance Maintained** -- Double-digit GP growth expected for full FY2026, with high single-digit operating profit growth.

### Unit Economics

Bytes' unit economics are exceptional for a VAR:

- **LTV/CAC Ratio:** Very high (estimated >10x) because customer relationships are multi-year, deeply embedded (license management, security), and switching costs are substantial.
- **FCF Margin:** ~30% of gross profit converts to FCF. On a revenue basis (using GP as effective revenue), this is among the highest in the sector.
- **Capital Intensity:** Ultra-light. Capex is negligible (<1% of revenue). No inventory. Negative working capital. The business requires almost no capital to grow.
- **Customer Retention:** Not explicitly disclosed but implied >95% based on recurring license renewals.

### Margin Structure

| Metric | Value | vs Sector (IT VARs) | Trend |
|--------|-------|---------------------|-------|
| Gross Margin (on GP basis) | ~36% (GP/Revenue) | +19.4pp premium | Expanding (services mix shift) |
| Operating Margin (OP/GP) | 40.7% (FY25) | Top tier | Expanding pre-H1 compression |
| FCF Margin | ~30% | Exceptional | Stable |

The gross margin premium vs sector of +19.4pp reflects Bytes' specialization in higher-value security and cloud services vs generic resellers.

## Por Que Esta Barata: Narrative vs Reality

### Market Narrative (Why -47% from High)

The market believes:

1. **[MAIN] Microsoft incentive restructuring permanently compresses VAR margins** -- Microsoft's FY26 changes to CSP incentives, EA partner incentives, and revenue thresholds are structural, not cyclical. Bytes' GP/GII margin will permanently be lower.

2. **[SECONDARY] Public sector growth stalling** -- UK public sector IT spending is constrained by austerity/budgets. The 1.6% growth is the new normal.

3. **[TERTIARY] Growth decelerating from 15%+ to single digits** -- The best growth days are behind. Multiple compression is warranted.

4. **[FEAR] AI/cloud could disintermediate VARs** -- If customers can self-serve via Microsoft directly (co-pilot, self-service portals), why do they need Bytes?

### My Counter-Thesis

**1. Microsoft Incentive Changes:**
- **Market says:** Permanent margin compression.
- **I believe:** This is a cyclical adjustment to a new incentive structure, not a permanent impairment. Microsoft restructures partner programs every 2-3 years. Partners adapt, find new incentive streams, and margins normalize. Bytes explicitly stated in H1 results that they have "settled into the new structure" after 8 months.
- **Evidence:**
  - Services growth +40%+ is directly filling the margin gap left by software incentive changes.
  - Microsoft NEEDS partners like Bytes to sell complex Enterprise Agreements -- they cannot do this direct-only.
  - The Growth Accelerator incentive rewards partners who grow customer revenue YoY -- this favors scale players like Bytes.
- **Probability I'm wrong:** 25%. If Microsoft continues to compress partner margins year after year, the economic moat narrows.

**2. Public Sector Slowdown:**
- **Market says:** New normal of low single-digit growth.
- **I believe:** H1 was the trough. Public sector is more impacted by EA incentive changes because of the nature of government licensing (large EA deals). As the new incentive structure normalizes and UK government digital transformation spending continues (mandated by National Cyber Strategy), public sector will recover to mid-single-digit growth.
- **Evidence:** UK government National Cyber Security Centre mandates are increasing, not decreasing. NHS digital transformation ongoing.
- **Probability I'm wrong:** 30%.

**3. Growth Deceleration:**
- **Market says:** Single-digit growth deserves single-digit multiple.
- **I believe:** FY2025 was 15%+ GII growth, 12% GP growth. H1 FY2026 is the trough of the incentive transition. Management guides double-digit GP growth for full FY2026. The structural drivers (cloud, cybersecurity, AI adoption) are accelerating. Post-transition, 8-12% GP growth is sustainable.
- **Evidence:** Services +40%, GII +9.1% even in trough half.
- **Probability I'm wrong:** 20%.

**4. AI Disintermediation:**
- **Market says:** AI makes it easier for customers to self-serve.
- **I believe:** AI actually INCREASES complexity and the need for expert advisors. Who helps customers figure out Azure OpenAI vs on-premise AI? Who manages the cybersecurity implications of AI adoption? VARs like Bytes. AI is a TAM expander, not a disintermediation threat.
- **Evidence:** Bytes explicitly investing in AI advisory services. AI is part of the services segment growing 40%+.
- **Probability I'm wrong:** 15%.

### Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | SI/NO | Comment |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Industry in secular decline | **NO** | UK IT spending growing 5-8% annually |
| Imminent technological disruption | **NO** | AI is opportunity, not threat for VARs |
| Management destroying value | **NO** | 9.6% insider ownership, special dividends |
| Deteriorating balance sheet | **NO** | Net cash, improving |
| Massive insider selling (>5% 12m) | **NO** | One exec sold GBP 259K (immaterial), director BOUGHT at 402p |
| Recent/probable dividend cut | **NO** | +15% dividend growth, plus special dividend |
| Market share loss >2pp 3yr | **NO** | Maintaining/gaining vs Softcat |
| ROIC < WACC last 3 years | **NO** | ROIC consistently above WACC |
| FCF negative >2 years | **NO** | FCF consistently positive |
| Goodwill >50% equity | **NO** | Asset-light, minimal goodwill |

**Value Trap Score: 0/10** -- Very low risk of value trap.

### My Informational Edge

- [x] **Longer time horizon** -- The market is pricing H1 margin compression as permanent. I can wait 12-18 months for normalization.
- [x] **Understanding the Microsoft partner cycle** -- Microsoft restructures partner programs every 2-3 years. This is not unprecedented. Partners always adapt.
- [x] **Market over-reaction** -- -47% for a 7% operating profit decline in one half-year is extreme. The P/E has gone from ~25x to 14x for what is likely a temporary margin trough.

## Competitive Position: Moat Analysis

### Moat Type: Switching Costs + Relationships + Scale

**1. Switching Costs (Strong)**
- Enterprise software licensing is deeply embedded. Changing your licensing partner means re-negotiating Microsoft EA terms, migrating security vendor relationships, re-training procurement teams.
- Customer relationships span years/decades. Trust in security posture management is critical.
- >95% implied customer retention.

**2. Relationship Capital (Strong)**
- Bytes holds top-tier Microsoft partner status (Solutions Partner designations in multiple areas).
- #1 or #2 in UK public sector VAR market alongside Softcat.
- Government frameworks (G-Cloud, CCS) require qualification -- barrier to entry.

**3. Scale Advantages (Moderate)**
- Larger VARs get better incentives from Microsoft (Growth Accelerator favors scale).
- $1M+ CSP revenue threshold eliminates smaller resellers.
- Cost to serve each additional customer decreases (leverage of back-office, compliance, training).

**Closest Peer: Softcat (SCT.L)**
| Metric | BYIT.L | SCT.L |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Market Cap | ~GBP 700M | ~GBP 4.5B |
| P/E | 14.1x | ~25x |
| ROIC | ~25%+ | ~36% |
| FCF Margin | ~30% | ~25% |
| Insider Ownership | 9.6% | Lower |
| Public Sector GII | GBP 1.14B | GBP 1.098B |

**Key observation:** Softcat trades at ~25x P/E vs Bytes at 14x. Both are exposed to the same Microsoft incentive changes. The valuation gap is extreme and reflects the market's excessive punishment of Bytes.

## Projections (Derived from Business Logic)

### TAM Analysis

| Component | Size | Growth | Source |
|-----------|------|--------|--------|
| UK Software Distribution Market | ~USD 26B (2025) | 12.8% CAGR | Future Market Insights |
| UK Public Sector VAR Market | ~GBP 3.7B | 5-8% | IT Channel Oxygen |
| UK Cybersecurity Market | ~USD 15B | 14% CAGR | Grand View Research |
| Global VAR Software Market | ~USD 9.1B (EU alone) | 6.2% CAGR | Business Research Insights |

**Relevant TAM for Bytes:** UK enterprise software + security + cloud services. I estimate ~GBP 20-25B, growing at 7-10% annually driven by:
- Cloud migration (still early innings for many UK enterprises)
- Cybersecurity mandatory investment (regulatory-driven)
- AI adoption services (new TAM unlocking)
- Digital transformation (NHS, government, education)

### Market Share Analysis

- Bytes public sector GII: GBP 1.14B / GBP 3.7B total = ~31% of public sector VAR
- Bytes total GII: GBP 2.1B / ~GBP 25B = ~8% of total UK enterprise IT resale
- **Trend:** Gaining share. Top VARs (Bytes, Softcat) are consolidating market from smaller resellers -- accelerated by Microsoft's higher revenue thresholds eliminating sub-scale partners.

### Pricing Power

- **Moderate:** Bytes cannot raise software prices (set by vendors). But Bytes CAN:
  - Increase services pricing (40%+ growth shows demand outpacing supply)
  - Shift mix toward higher-margin services and security
  - Earn better incentives through scale and specialization
- **Pricing Power Score: Moderate** -- can match inflation through mix shift, not direct price increases.

### Revenue Projection

```
Revenue Growth = TAM Growth (~8%) + Market Share Gains (~1-2pp from consolidation) + Mix Shift to Services (~1%)
= ~10-12% GP growth base case
```

| Scenario | GP Growth | Operating Profit Growth | Reasoning |
|----------|-----------|------------------------|-----------|
| **Bear** | 4% | 2% | Microsoft incentives worsen further, public sector stagnates, services growth slows to 15% |
| **Base** | 8% | 7% | Current guidance. Incentive transition normalizes, services grows 25-30%, moderate public sector recovery |
| **Bull** | 13% | 12% | Pre-transition growth resumes, AI services boom, new vendor partnerships, public sector recovery to double digits |

### WACC Derivation

```
Risk-Free Rate (UK 10Y Gilt): 4.2%
Equity Risk Premium: 5.0%
Beta: 0.85 (yfinance data -- relatively low for UK mid-cap tech, reflecting defensive nature)
    Beta sanity check: Bytes is not highly cyclical. Revenue is ~80% recurring.
    0.85 seems reasonable for a defensive tech services company.

Cost of Equity (Ke) = 4.2% + 0.85 * 5.0% = 8.45%

Cost of Debt: Not applicable -- Bytes has net cash, zero debt.
Weight Equity: 100%
Weight Debt: 0%

WACC = 8.45%

Sanity Check: 8.45% for a net-cash UK mid-cap tech company with 80%+ recurring revenue.
This is reasonable -- lower than typical tech (10-12%) because of the defensive, recurring nature.
I'll use 9.0% as a conservative round-up to account for Microsoft concentration risk.
```

### Terminal Growth Rate

```
UK GDP growth: ~1.5-2.0%
IT spending grows structurally above GDP (~1.5x)
But terminal growth must be <= GDP: 2.5% max

Terminal Growth = 2.5% (UK-focused, defensive IT services, structural tailwind)
```

## Valuation (Tier A: OEY + Reverse DCF)

### Method 1: Owner Earnings Yield (Primary, Weight 60%)

```
Free Cash Flow (TTM): ~GBP 48M (estimated from ~30% FCF margin on ~GBP 160M GP)
Depreciation: ~GBP 3M (asset-light)
Maintenance Capex: ~GBP 3.3M (Depreciation x 1.1)

Owner Earnings = FCF - Maintenance Capex = GBP 48M - 3.3M = GBP 44.7M
(Note: FCF already nets out capex, so Owner Earnings ~ FCF for this asset-light business)

Market Cap: ~GBP 700M (at 296p, ~237M shares)

Owner Earnings Yield = GBP 44.7M / GBP 700M = 6.4%
Expected Growth (GP CAGR): 8% (base case)
OEY + Growth = 6.4% + 8.0% = 14.4%

vs WACC = 9.0%
Spread = +5.4pp -- clearly attractive

For comparison (precedentes):
- ADBE OEY + Growth = 16.5% (purchased at 31% MoS)
- NVO OEY + Growth was similar range (purchased at 38% MoS)
- AUTO.L OEY + Growth was ~14-15% (purchased at 29% MoS)

BYIT at 14.4% is in the same range as our other Tier A purchases.
```

**OEY-Implied Fair Value:**
To find the price where OEY + Growth = WACC (minimum acceptable return):
- At WACC 9.0%, growth 8%, minimum OEY = 1.0%
- That implies market cap = GBP 44.7M / 1.0% = GBP 4.47B
- Per share = 4,470M / 237M shares = 1,886p -- this is the "theoretical maximum" but absurd

More practically, for OEY + Growth to equal a reasonable total return of 12% (our typical target):
- Required OEY = 12% - 8% = 4.0%
- Market Cap = GBP 44.7M / 4.0% = GBP 1.12B
- Per share = 1,120M / 237M = 472p

**OEY Fair Value: ~470p** (price at which OEY + Growth = 12% total return)

### Method 2: DCF with Derived Parameters (Secondary, Weight 40%)

Using derived parameters (growth 8%, WACC 9.0%, terminal 2.5%):

**DCF Tool Results (growth 8%, WACC 9.5%, terminal 2.5%):**
| Scenario | Fair Value | MoS vs 296p |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Bear | 425p | +43% |
| Base | 525p | +77% |
| Bull | 663p | +124% |

**DCF Tool Results (conservative: growth 6%, WACC 10%, terminal 2%):**
| Scenario | Fair Value | MoS vs 296p |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Bear | 356p | +20% |
| Base | 432p | +46% |
| Bull | 533p | +80% |

**DCF Sanity Check:**
- Default DCF (growth 5%, WACC 9%): Base 500p, Bear 401p
- Custom DCF (growth 8%, WACC 9.5%): Base 525p
- Conservative DCF (growth 6%, WACC 10%): Base 432p

The DCF range of 430-525p base case is reasonable given EPS of ~21p growing at 8-13%.
At 430p, forward P/E would be ~18-19x on FY2026 EPS of ~23p -- reasonable for Tier A quality.
At 525p, forward P/E would be ~23x -- premium warranted for quality compounder.

**I use the conservative DCF base case of 432p for the DCF method.**

### Method 3: EV/EBIT Peer Comparison (Cross-Check)

| Company | EV/EBIT | Quality | Growth |
|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| Softcat (SCT.L) | ~20x | Tier A (ROIC 36%) | 8-10% |
| Computacenter (CCC.L) | ~12x | Tier B | 5-7% |
| BYIT.L (current) | ~11x | Tier A (QS 81) | 8-10% |

Bytes at 11x EV/EBIT vs Softcat at 20x is a massive discount for a comparable business.

If I assign Bytes a **15x EV/EBIT** (discount to Softcat due to smaller scale, but premium to Computacenter due to higher quality):
- EBIT (TTM): ~GBP 62M
- EV = 15 x 62 = GBP 930M
- Less net cash: +GBP 40M
- Equity Value = GBP 970M
- Per share = 970M / 237M = 409p

At 17x (narrowing discount to Softcat as incentive transition normalizes):
- EV = 17 x 62 = GBP 1,054M + 40M = GBP 1,094M
- Per share = 461p

**EV/EBIT cross-check: 410-460p** -- consistent with other methods.

### Valuation Reconciliation

| Method | Fair Value | Weight | Weighted |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Owner Earnings Yield | 470p | 60% | 282p |
| DCF (Conservative Base) | 432p | 40% | 173p |
| **Weighted Average** | | **100%** | **455p** |

**Cross-check: EV/EBIT peer comparison: 410-460p** -- validates the 455p weighted FV.
**Cross-check: Analyst consensus target: 461-491p** -- consistent with my 455p.
**Cross-check: Director bought shares at 402p** -- insider believes fair value is above 402p.

**Divergence between methods: 9%** (470p vs 432p) -- well within acceptable range.

## Escenarios Bear/Base/Bull

| Scenario | Prob | FV (GBp) | Assumptions |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| **Bear** | 25% | 350p | Microsoft continues compressing incentives, services growth slows to 15%, public sector flat, GP growth 4%, OP growth 2%, P/E 15x on reduced earnings |
| **Base** | 50% | 455p | Incentive transition normalizes by H2 FY2026, services 25-30% growth, GP growth 8%, OP growth 7%, P/E 18x on FY2027E EPS ~25p |
| **Bull** | 25% | 580p | AI services boom, incentive structure favors scale (Bytes gains share), public sector recovery, GP growth 13%, OP growth 12%, P/E 22x |

### Expected Value Calculation

```
EV = (350 x 0.25) + (455 x 0.50) + (580 x 0.25)
EV = 87.5 + 227.5 + 145
EV = 460p

Current Price: 296p
MoS vs Expected Value: (460 - 296) / 460 = 35.7%
MoS vs Base Case: (455 - 296) / 455 = 34.9%
MoS vs Bear Case: (350 - 296) / 350 = 15.4%
```

---

## MoS Assessment

- **vs Expected Value: 35.7%** -- Excellent for Tier A
- **vs Base Case: 34.9%** -- Excellent for Tier A
- **vs Bear Case: 15.4%** -- Good downside protection

**Precedent comparison (from decisions_log.yaml):**
| Ticker | Tier | QS | MoS at Purchase | Context |
|--------|------|-----|-----------------|---------|
| NVO | A | 82 | 38% | Guidance shock, -17% in 2 days |
| MONY.L | A | 81 | 36% | At 52-week low |
| LULU | A | 82 | 34% | -58% fallen angel |
| ADBE | A | 76 | 31% | At 52-week low |
| AUTO.L | A | 79 | 29% | -47% dealer revolt |
| **BYIT.L** | **A** | **81** | **35%** | **-47% Microsoft incentive transition** |

**BYIT.L at 35% MoS is squarely within the range of Tier A precedents** (29-38%). The company quality (QS 81) is comparable to NVO (82) and MONY.L (81), and the MoS is in the upper half of the range.

## Kill Conditions

1. **Microsoft structurally disintermediates VARs** -- If Microsoft launches a direct-sales platform that bypasses partners for Enterprise Agreements, the business model is fundamentally impaired. Probability: Low (10%). Microsoft has tried this before and always returns to partner channel.

2. **FCF turns negative for 2+ consecutive years** -- Would indicate fundamental business deterioration beyond cyclical adjustment. Currently FCF is ~GBP 48M with 30% margin.

3. **Services growth decelerates below 10%** -- If the services offset to software margin compression fails, the bull case collapses. Services at 40%+ currently.

4. **Major customer loss or public sector framework exclusion** -- Loss of G-Cloud or CCS framework qualification would eliminate public sector revenue (~50% of business).

5. **Quality Score falls below 75** -- Reclassification from Tier A to Tier B would require re-evaluation of the compounding thesis.

**Model Disruption Kill Conditions (added 2026-02-11):**
6. **AI-automated procurement eliminates VAR advisory role** — If enterprise customers can use AI tools to autonomously compare, license, and deploy Microsoft/cloud software without human VAR guidance (the "self-service" threat), Bytes' value-add collapses. The moat is expertise in complex licensing; if AI makes licensing simple, the margin on advisory disappears. Monitor: Microsoft Copilot for procurement, enterprise self-service licensing adoption, Bytes' services attachment rate trends.
7. **Microsoft shifts to consumption-based pricing universally** — If Microsoft eliminates Enterprise Agreements and commits fully to consumption/pay-as-you-go pricing (reducing the complexity that VARs help navigate), the licensing advisory business structurally shrinks. Currently EAs require 3-year commitments with complex true-ups — that complexity IS the VAR's moat. Monitor: Microsoft licensing model announcements, EA renewal rates, consumption vs commitment revenue mix at Microsoft.

## Macro Fit

### Sensitivity

| Factor | Sensitivity | Impact on BYIT |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Interest rates | Low | Net cash, no debt. Higher rates don't affect operations. Indirect: P/E compression on growth stocks. |
| Recession | Medium | Enterprise IT is somewhat defensive (must-have), but discretionary projects deferred. Public sector counter-cyclical. |
| Inflation | Low | Strong pricing power through services. Labor costs (main cost) manageable. |
| USD strength | Low | UK-focused business, GBP-denominated. Indirect: Microsoft costs in USD could affect. |
| UK fiscal policy | Medium | Public sector spending is policy-dependent. Cyber/digital mandates provide floor. |

## Portfolio Context

### Current UK Exposure

We hold 6 UK stocks (including BYIT.L): AUTO.L, MONY.L, IMB.L, TATE.L, DOM.L, BYIT.L.

These are diverse sectors: auto classifieds, price comparison, tobacco, food ingredients, pizza franchise, and IT services. Correlation between these businesses is low. The question per Principle 2: "What event would affect ALL these UK positions simultaneously?" Answer: A severe UK recession. But BYIT has 80%+ recurring revenue and counter-cyclical public sector exposure.

### Sizing Reasoning

**Position: 3.5% initial (~444 USD / ~377 EUR)**

Reasoning:
- Consistent with Tier A precedents (ADBE 4.8%, NVO 3.4%, MONY.L 4.1%, AUTO.L 3.4%, LULU 3.5%)
- If it falls 50%, portfolio loses 1.75% -- acceptable for Tier A quality with 0/10 value trap score
- Not sizing at 4-5% because the Microsoft incentive uncertainty is real and I want to leave room for ADD if price drops further or H2 results confirm recovery

**ADD Trigger: 260p (MoS >43%)** -- If price drops another 12%, the MoS becomes exceptional.

## Adversarial Review Summary (2026-02-11)

### Five Independent Agent Reports

| Agent | Key Finding | FV Estimate |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| **review-agent** | QS Tool 68 vs thesis 81. FV -24.2%. Thesis materially flawed. | 345 GBp |
| **moat-assessor** | NARROW moat (14/25), not near-Wide (22/25). Microsoft dependency = risk, not moat. | N/A (QS impact -8) |
| **risk-identifier** | HIGH risk. 3 CRITICAL, 3 HIGH risks. 9 risks NOT in thesis. Insider ownership factual error. | 330-380 GBp |
| **valuation-specialist** (Feb 9) | Normalized FCF GBP 40-50M. Growth 6% not 8%. WACC 9.5-10% not 9%. | 366 GBp |
| **devil's-advocate** (Feb 9) | STRONG COUNTER. Microsoft EA disintermediation is structural, not cyclical. Softcat P/E compressed to 17x. | 330 GBp |

### Adversarial Consensus

| Metric | Original Thesis | Adversarial | Delta |
|--------|----------------|-------------|-------|
| Quality Score | 81 (Tier A) | 68-72 (Tier B) | **-9 to -13** |
| Fair Value | 455 GBp | **345 GBp** | **-24.2%** |
| Bear FV | 350 GBp | 275-300 GBp | -14% to -21% |
| Bull FV | 580 GBp | 460 GBp | -21% |
| MoS at 292p | 35.6% | **15.1%** | -20.5pp |
| Growth assumption | 8% | 6% | -2pp |
| WACC | 9.0% | 9.5-10% | +0.5-1pp |
| Value Trap Score | 0/10 | 2/10 | +2 |
| Moat | Wide/near-Wide | **NARROW** (14/25) | Downgrade |

### Key Adversarial Findings

1. **Microsoft EA direct sales = structural disintermediation, not cyclical adjustment.** LSP commissions: $2.5B (2023) → $0 (2026). 68% of GII is Microsoft. Thesis conflated incentive restructuring with channel elimination.
2. **Insider ownership is 0.4-0.5%, not 9.6%.** The yfinance figure likely includes Altron-era blockholders. New CEO Sam Mudd bought only GBP 99K.
3. **Softcat P/E is 17x, not 25x.** The "massive valuation gap" thesis argument has collapsed. Remaining gap (17x vs 14x) may be justified by Softcat's higher ROIC (36% vs 25%) and larger scale.
4. **Former CEO governance scandal omitted from thesis.** Neil Murphy: 119 undisclosed trades, forced resignation Feb 2024.
5. **Services 40% growth is from a small base** (7.3% of GP in H1). Needs years to offset software margin compression.
6. **ROE trajectory declining:** 69% → 66% → 60% → 56% over 4 years. Not compounder behavior.
7. **Operating cost inflation vs flat revenue:** H1 headcount +12%, GP +0.4%, OP -7%. Margin scissors.

### Why HOLD, Not SELL

Despite significant thesis flaws, BYIT.L does NOT match the SELL pattern from prior adversarials:
1. **ROIC is NOT below WACC** — ROE 56% >> WACC 9.5%. Every prior SELL (A2A, VNA, TATE, SAN.PA, HRB, SHEL, PFE, TEP) had ROIC<WACC or near it.
2. **Net cash GBP 43M** — no debt risk, genuine downside protection.
3. **FCF consistently positive** (GBP 36-65M range over 4 years). Business generates real cash.
4. **Position is small** (3.5%, EUR 377). Limited absolute risk. Selling at 52-week low for negligible capital recovery.
5. **Services growth at 40%+** is a genuine pivot underway, even if from low base.
6. **H2 FY2026 results (~May 2026)** provide definitive data point before any EXIT decision.
7. **Selling at 52-week low without kill condition violates Principio 6.**
