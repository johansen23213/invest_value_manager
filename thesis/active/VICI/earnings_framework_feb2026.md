## 3. ESCENARIOS DE EARNINGS

### BEAR (probabilidad 30%)
**AFFO guidance < $2.35 OR Caesars Regional rent cut >10% w/o compensation**

Que buscar:
- AFFO/share FY2026 guidance < $2.35
- Caesars rent reduction disclosed > 10% WITHOUT asset transfer/lease extension
- LV tourism commentary negative (management acknowledges structural decline)
- Acquisition pipeline described as "limited" or "challenging"
- Analyst downgrades post-call (adding to Evercore/WFC/Scotia pattern)

**Implicacion:** KC#7 triggered (rent cut w/o compensation) OR thesis invalidated.
**ACCION: SELL 21 shares. No hesitation. Probation verdict = EXIT.**
**Precio esperado en bear:** $25-27

### BASE (probabilidad 45%)
**AFFO guidance $2.35-$2.50, Caesars rent cut <=5% with partial compensation**

Que buscar:
- Q4 AFFO/share ~$0.60-0.62 (in line with guidance)
- FY2026 AFFO guidance $2.40-$2.50
- Caesars Regional: rent reduction -5-7% offset by asset transfer + lease extension
- Golden Entertainment + Northfield Park accretion confirmed ($140M/yr rent)
- LV tourism commentary neutral/improving

**Implicacion:** Thesis intact but not strengthened. FV stays ~$29-30.
**ACCION: HOLD LOW conviction. Next review Q1 2026 earnings.**
**Sub-scenario:** If guidance $2.45+ AND Caesars fully resolved → UPGRADE to HOLD MEDIUM

### BULL (probabilidad 25%)
**AFFO guidance > $2.50, no Caesars rent cut OR fully compensated, positive pipeline**

Que buscar:
- AFFO/share FY2026 guidance >= $2.50
- Caesars Regional: no rent cut, or rent cut fully offset by asset acquisition at favorable terms
- New acquisition announcement at 7%+ cap rate
- Fed rate cut commentary positive for refinancing
- Tourism stabilization data for LV

**Implicacion:** FV increases to $31-34. MoS re-emerges.
**ACCION: UPGRADE to HOLD MEDIUM. Consider ADD at $27 (10% below FV).**

## 5. DATOS CLAVE A EXTRAER DEL CALL

2. Caesars Regional lease status — any disclosure on renegotiation
3. Acquisition pipeline — new targets, cap rates, timing

**Prioridad 2 (thesis-informativa):**
4. Same-store rent growth (organic escalators performing?)
5. LV tourism commentary (improving, stable, declining?)
6. Credit metrics (net leverage trend, any refinancing)
7. Dividend growth outlook for FY2026

**Prioridad 3 (nice-to-have):**
8. Northfield Park closing timeline
9. iGaming/sports betting impact on tenant GGR
10. Interest expense / WACC trend

## 7. CONTEXT POSITIONING

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Portfolio weight | ~5% (21 shares, $615 invested) |
| Max downside to bear ($25) | -$89 (-14.5%), portfolio impact -0.8% |
| Opportunity cost | This $615 in PAYC/MORN at 25% MoS = better expected return |
| Correlation | Only REIT/gaming exposure in portfolio |
| Cash available | EUR 4,844 (44%) — no urgency to sell for cash |

**The question is NOT "will VICI survive?" — it's "is this the best use of $615?"**
Per Principio 9 (Quality Gravitation), QS ~60 Tier B is below target. The Feb 25 earnings must justify continued capital allocation vs deploying to pipeline Tier A candidates.
