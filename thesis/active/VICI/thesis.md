## SECTION 1: BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

### 1.1 What Problem Does It Solve?

VICI provides capital to gaming/experiential operators via sale-leaseback transactions. Operators monetize real estate without losing operational control; VICI gets long-term, inflation-protected cash flows from triple-net leases.

**Revenue Model**: 100% contractual triple-net lease rental income. Zero transactional or project-based revenue. ~30-year average remaining lease term.

### 1.2 Unit Economics (REIT-specific)

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| WACC | 7.0% (derived) | Conservative for BBB- REIT |
| Portfolio implied cap rate | ~7.0% | $3.15B rent / ~$45B gross assets |
| Spread over WACC | ~0bp | Minimal value creation on existing portfolio |
| AFFO margin | >90% | NNN = virtually no opex |
| Rent coverage (blended) | ~1.5x | Varies dramatically by tenant — see Section 3 |
| Rent coverage (Caesars Regional) | **1.03x** | **CRITICAL — see risk section** |

### 1.3 Tenant Concentration (CRITICAL)

| Tenant | % of Rent | Coverage | Risk |
|--------|-----------|----------|------|
| Caesars (Las Vegas) | ~24% | >2.0x | LOW |
| Caesars (Regional) | ~25% | **1.03x** | **HIGH** |
| MGM | ~25% | ~1.5x | MEDIUM |
| Other (14+ tenants) | ~26% | 1.5-2.0x | LOW |

**Key insight v3.0**: The thesis v2.0 stated "rent coverage 1.5-2.0x" as if it were homogeneous. It is NOT. Caesars Regional at 1.03x means 25% of VICI's NOI is at risk of rent reduction. This was absent from v2.0 entirely.

---

## SECTION 2: WHY IS IT CHEAP?

### 2.1 Market Narrative (Updated v3.0)

The market believes:
- [X] **Caesars Regional lease unsustainable at 1.03x** (VALIDATED by JP Morgan, Evercore, Wells Fargo)
- [X] **Interest rate uncertainty**: Fed funds at 3.5-3.75%, but long-end rates elevated (10Y ~4.2%)
- [X] **LV tourism weakening**: YTD Nov 2025 visitors down ~7.5% vs prior year, airport traffic -9% H1 2025
- [X] **Limited acquisition pipeline**: Management flagged constrained deal flow and macro pressure on construction budgets
- [ ] Dividend cut: NO - 76% payout ratio, well-covered even after Caesars adjustments

### 2.2 My Contra-Thesis (WEAKENED vs v2.0)

**v2.0 said**: "Concentration is MITIGATED by asset quality. Las Vegas visitor volume at record 42M+. Rent coverage 1.5-2.0x."

**v3.0 reality**: All three of those statements were factually incorrect or misleading:
1. **LV visitors are NOT at record highs** — YTD Nov 2025: 35.4M visitors, -7.5% vs prior year. Airport traffic -9% H1 2025. The thesis overstated this.
2. **Rent coverage is NOT 1.5-2.0x uniformly** — Caesars Regional is 1.03x, covering 25% of VICI's NOI. This was completely omitted.
3. **Concentration is NOT mitigated** — 49% of rent from Caesars (LV + Regional). If Regional needs rent relief, it directly hits VICI.

**What remains valid**:
- 30-year leases with CPI escalators are real structural protection
- NNN model means VICI bears zero operational risk at property level
- VICI is diversifying (Golden Entertainment, Northfield Park, Great Wolf, Bowlero)
- Rate environment likely favorable for REITs in 2026 (expected cuts)
- Q3 2025 AFFO +7.4% YoY shows execution is solid

**Updated probability I'm wrong**: 35% (was 20%). Caesars Regional lease risk is real and material, not theoretical.

### 2.3 Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | Status | Comment |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Industry in secular decline | **NO** | Gaming stable, experiential growing |
| Imminent tech disruption | **NO** | Physical casinos irreplaceable |
| Management destroying value | **NO** | Ed Pitoniak disciplined, IG maintained |
| Balance sheet deteriorating | **WATCH** | 5.0x D/EBITDA, IG (BBB-), but limited headroom |
| Massive insider selling | **NO** | Normal compensation sales |
| Recent/probable dividend cut | **NO** | 76% payout, raised 4% in Q3 2025 |
| Market share loss | **NO** | Gaining via acquisitions |
| ROIC < WACC | **BORDERLINE** | Cap rate spread vs WACC is thin (~0bp) |
| FCF negative | **NO** | AFFO positive every quarter since IPO |
| Goodwill >50% equity | **NO** | Minimal goodwill, tangible assets |

**Value Trap Score: 1/10** (ROIC spread borderline)

---

## SECTION 3: CAESARS REGIONAL LEASE RISK (NEW — CORE RISK)

### 3.1 The Problem

Caesars Regional casinos generate ~$750M annual EBITDA against $730M annual rent = **1.03x coverage**. This is unsustainable — both parties acknowledge this. A rent reduction is likely.

### 3.2 What's Being Negotiated

Per JP Morgan analyst Daniel Politzer (Nov 2025):
- "We do think a rent reduction and/or less onerous escalator is a possibility"
- "Expect any transaction would likely have several moving parts"

**Possible deal structures**:
1. Rent reduction in exchange for Caesars selling a brick-and-mortar casino or undeveloped land to VICI
2. Lease extension to 2045 (current ~2035) in exchange for reduced rent/escalators
3. Combination of both

### 3.3 Quantified Impact Scenarios

**Scenario A: Moderate rent reduction (-5%)**: $730M → $693.5M
- AFFO impact: -$36.5M or -$0.034/share (-1.4%)
- If offset by asset acquisition at 7% cap → net impact near zero

**Scenario B: Significant rent reduction (-10%)**: $730M → $657M
- AFFO impact: -$73M or -$0.068/share (-2.9%)
- Would require meaningful compensation (asset + extension)

**Scenario C: Escalator reduction only**: Replace CPI escalator with 1% fixed
- Long-term compounding impact: -$0.10-$0.15/share over 5 years
- Less visible but significant over time

**Probability-weighted AFFO impact**:
- 30% Scenario A: -$0.010
- 40% Scenario B: -$0.027
- 20% Scenario C: -$0.010
- 10% No change: $0
- **Expected AFFO drag: -$0.047/share** or ~-2% of 2025 AFFO

### 3.4 Kill Condition Implication

If rent reduction exceeds 10% WITHOUT adequate compensation (no asset transfer, no lease extension), this would represent a permanent impairment to VICI's earning power on 25% of its portfolio. That triggers proposed KC#7.

---

## SECTION 4: LAS VEGAS TOURISM (CORRECTED)

### v2.0 Claim vs Reality

| Metric | v2.0 Thesis Claim | Actual Data | Source |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| Annual visitors | "42M+, record" | YTD Nov 2025: 35.4M (annualized ~38.6M) | LVCVA |
| Trend | "Record convention bookings" | Sep -8.8% YoY, Nov -5.2% YoY | LVCVA |
| Airport traffic | Not mentioned | -9.04% H1 2025 (1.19M fewer passengers) | LVCVA |

**Assessment**: Las Vegas tourism is weakening, not at record levels. This affects Caesars and MGM's ability to generate EBITDA, which in turn affects rent coverage. The thesis v2.0 was citing stale or inaccurate data. VICI COO John Payne acknowledged the "market environment that defies easy explanation" but expressed confidence that "Las Vegas has endured cycles before."

**Mitigating factor**: VICI's NNN structure means it doesn't bear operational downside from lower visitors directly. The risk materializes only if tenants' coverage ratios deteriorate further — which is already happening at Caesars Regional.

---

## SECTION 5: PROJECTION FRAMEWORK (v3.0 — Revised)

### 5.1 AFFO Projection

**Changes vs v2.0**:
- Reduced base growth from 5% to 4% (tourism headwinds + limited deal pipeline)
- Incorporated Caesars Regional rent reduction (-$0.05/share by 2027)
- Added Golden Entertainment + Northfield Park accretion ($87M + $53M = $140M/yr at ~7% yield)

| Year | AFFO/share | Growth | Notes |
|------|------------|--------|-------|
| 2025A | $2.37 | +5% | FY25 guidance $2.36-$2.37 |
| 2026E | $2.45 | +3.4% | Caesars Regional drag -$0.05, acquisitions +$0.08, organic +$0.05 |
| 2027E | $2.53 | +3.3% | Normalized growth post-rent-reset |
| 2028E | $2.63 | +4.0% | Pipeline recovery assumed |
| 2029E | $2.74 | +4.0% | Steady state |
| 2030E | $2.85 | +4.0% | Steady state |

### 5.2 WACC (Unchanged)

WACC = 7.0% (same derivation as v2.0: Ke 7.82%, Kd 4.47%, E/V 63.6%, D/V 36.4%, rounded up for conservatism).

### 5.3 Terminal Growth: 2.0% (unchanged — CPI-linked escalators)

---

## SECTION 6: MULTI-METHOD VALUATION (v3.0)

### Method 1: Dividend Discount Model (DDM)

```
D0 = $1.80 (current annual dividend)
g = 3.5% (reduced from 4.5%: Caesars Regional risk + slower acquisitions + tourism headwinds)
Ke = 10% (required return for conservatism)

D1 = $1.80 x 1.035 = $1.863

FV = D1 / (Ke - g) = $1.863 / (0.10 - 0.035) = $28.66
```

**DDM Fair Value: $28.66** (was $34.18 in v2.0, -16.1%)

### Method 2: NAV (Net Asset Value)

**Conservative case — incorporating Caesars Regional rent reduction**:
```
Adjusted Rent: $3.15B - $0.073B (10% Caesars Regional cut) = $3.077B
Cap Rate: 7.0% (conservative for mixed quality)
Asset Value: $3.077B / 0.07 = $43.96B
Less Net Debt: $16.6B
Equity Value: $27.36B
Shares: 1.07B
NAV/share = $25.57
```

**Base case — current rent intact**:
```
Rent: $3.15B at 7.0% cap rate
Asset Value: $45.0B - $16.6B debt = $28.4B / 1.07B = $26.54
```

**NAV Range: $25.57 - $26.54**
**NAV Midpoint: $26.06** (was $28.15 in v2.0, -7.4%)

Note: NAV is lower because I now use 7.0% cap rate consistently (v2.0 used 6.5% for "Class A" which mixed the quality between Strip assets and deteriorating regionals).

### Method 3: P/AFFO Multiple

**2025 AFFO**: $2.37/share

**Multiple selection (revised down)**:
- Net-lease REIT sector avg: 12.9x (Chilton Capital, Nov 2025)
- GLPI (gaming peer): 12-13x
- Evercore notes VICI trades at 12x 2026E AFFO
- Analyst downgrades + Caesars lease overhang justify below-peer multiple

**Base Case (12.5x)**: $2.37 x 12.5 = $29.63 (was 14x = $33.18 in v2.0)
**Bear Case (11x)**: $2.37 x 11 = $26.07
**Bull Case (14x)**: $2.37 x 14 = $33.18

### Valuation Reconciliation

| Method | Fair Value | Weight | Weighted FV |
|--------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| DDM (conservative) | $28.66 | 30% | $8.60 |
| NAV (midpoint) | $26.06 | 30% | $7.82 |
| P/AFFO Base (12.5x) | $29.63 | 40% | $11.85 |
| **Weighted Average** | | **100%** | **$28.27** |

---

## SECTION 7: SCENARIO ANALYSIS (v3.0)

### Bear Case (30% probability — up from 25%)

**Assumptions**:
- Caesars Regional rent cut -10% with no adequate compensation
- AFFO growth: 2% (limited acquisitions, rate uncertainty)
- P/AFFO: 11x (continued analyst negativity)
- 2026E AFFO: $2.41

**Bear FV**: $2.41 x 11 = $26.51

### Base Case (45% probability — down from 50%)

**Assumptions**:
- Caesars Regional rent cut -5-7% offset by asset transfer + lease extension
- AFFO growth: 3.5% (Golden + Northfield accretion, tourism stabilization)
- P/AFFO: 12.5x
- 2026E AFFO: $2.45

**Base FV**: $2.45 x 12.5 = $30.63

### Bull Case (25% probability)

**Assumptions**:
- No Caesars Regional rent cut (or fully compensated)
- Fed cuts 2-3x in 2026, REIT re-rating
- AFFO growth: 5% (accretive deals, tourism recovery)
- P/AFFO: 14x
- 2026E AFFO: $2.49

**Bull FV**: $2.49 x 14 = $34.86

### Expected Value

```
EV = (Bear x 30%) + (Base x 45%) + (Bull x 25%)
EV = ($26.51 x 0.30) + ($30.63 x 0.45) + ($34.86 x 0.25)
EV = $7.95 + $13.78 + $8.72
EV = $30.45

Rounded: $30.50 (unchanged from adversarial, pre-acquisition accretion offsets tourism deterioration)

Wait — with updated data:
- Adversarial used $30.50
- My analysis yields $30.45 before rounding
- But I'm now using lower NAV ($26.06 vs $28.15) and lower DDM ($28.66 vs $34.18)
- The weighted reconciliation gives $28.27
- EV scenario gives $30.45

Reconciling: The multi-method weighted average ($28.27) is more conservative than the scenario EV ($30.45).
I'll use the average of both: ($28.27 + $30.45) / 2 = $29.36 → round to $29.00 for conservatism.

Final FV: $29.00

Current Price: $29.06
Margin of Safety: -0.2% (essentially NO margin of safety)
MoS vs Bear: -8.8% (price ABOVE bear case risk)
```

## SECTION 8: QUALITY SCORE

### QS Tool-First (MANDATORY)

- **QS Tool**: 54/100 (Tier C)
  - Financial Quality: 14/40 (REIT structural penalty — low ROE/ROIC is normal for NNN, high leverage is standard)
  - Growth Quality: 18/25 (moderate AFFO growth, stable revenue)
  - Moat Evidence: 17/25 (irreplaceable Strip assets, 30yr leases, CPI escalators)
  - Capital Allocation: 5/10 (dividend commitment, limited buybacks)

- **QS Adjusted**: ~60/100 (Tier B)
  - Adjustment: Financial Quality 14→20 (+6) for REIT structural distortion (triple-net REITs always score low on ROE/ROIC/leverage metrics — industry standard 5.0x D/EBITDA is not comparable to industrial companies)
  - Adjustment: Moat 17→15 (-2) for Caesars Regional lease demonstrating that "tenant can't walk away" doesn't mean "tenant can afford rent"
  - Net adjustment: +4 points → 58, rounded to ~60

- **Tier**: B (Quality Value)
- **Was**: v2.0 claimed 8/10 custom = Tier A. This was overclaimed by ~2 full tiers.

### Why Lower Than v2.0

| Factor | v2.0 | v3.0 | Reason |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Moat claimed | "Wide — irreplaceable assets" | Narrow — tenant dependency exposed | Caesars Regional 1.03x shows moat is only as strong as weakest tenant |
| ROIC spread | "+40bp over WACC" | ~0bp | Recalculated with updated cap rates |
| Growth outlook | 5% steady | 3.5% with Caesars drag | Tourism declining, acquisition pipeline constrained |
| Capital allocation | "Accretive acquisitions" | Mixed — Golden/Northfield OK but pipeline thinning | Limited high-quality targets flagged by management |

---

## SECTION 9: MACRO FIT (v3.0)

| Factor | Sensitivity | Current Impact |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Interest rates | MEDIUM-HIGH | Modestly positive — rate cuts expected 2026, but long-end still elevated |
| Recession | LOW-MEDIUM | NNN = tenant bears operational risk, but Caesars Regional coverage leaves zero buffer |
| Inflation | POSITIVE | CPI escalators, though Caesars may negotiate lower escalator |
| Tourism/Travel | MEDIUM | LV visitors declining. Not catastrophic but headwind. |
| Acquisition market | MEDIUM | Limited deal flow flagged. Macro pressuring construction budgets. |

**Macro Assessment**: NEUTRAL (was "FAVORABLE" in v2.0). Rate environment is improving but tourism decline and Caesars Regional lease offset.

---

## SECTION 10: ANALYST CONSENSUS (NEW)

| Analyst | Firm | Rating | PT | Date | Key View |
|---------|------|--------|-----|------|----------|
| Steve Sakwa | Evercore ISI | **In-Line** (was Outperform) | $32 (was $36) | Dec 2025 | Caesars Regional lease overhang |
| - | Wells Fargo | **Equal-Weight** (was Overweight) | $32 (was $36) | Nov 2025 | Caesars lease concerns |
| Daniel Politzer | JP Morgan | - | - | Nov 2025 | Rent reduction likely, multi-part deal |
| - | Scotiabank | **Downgraded** | Lowered | - | - |

**Pattern**: Three independent analyst downgrades in Q4 2025, all citing Caesars Regional lease. This is not noise.

---

## SECTION 11: RECENT DEVELOPMENTS (Q3 2025 — latest available)

**Q4 2025 earnings not yet released. Scheduled Feb 25, 2026.**

### Q3 2025 Results
- Revenue: $1.01B (+4.4% YoY)
- AFFO: $637.6M (+7.4% YoY)
- AFFO/share: $0.60 (+5.3% YoY)
- Net income: $773.6M (vs $744.5M YoY)
- Dividend: $0.45/share quarterly (+4.0% increase)
- FY25 AFFO guidance: $2.36-$2.37/share

### Acquisitions

- **Northfield Park (Clairvest)**: $53M/yr rent, 25-year lease, 3 x 10-year renewal options. Expected H1 2026 close.
- **Pipeline note**: Management flagged "macroeconomic pressures on construction budgets and limited high-quality real estate acquisition opportunities."

---

## SECTION 12: KILL CONDITIONS (Updated v3.0)

Sell immediately if ANY of these occur:

1. Caesars or MGM misses rent payment (even once)
2. Dividend cut
3. AFFO/share declines YoY for 2 consecutive quarters
4. Credit rating downgraded below BB+
5. Major regulatory change structurally impairing casino economics
6. Net leverage >6.5x for 2+ quarters
7. **NEW: Caesars Regional rent reduction >10% WITHOUT adequate compensation** (no asset transfer, no lease extension, or assets received at unfavorable terms)

---

## SECTION 13: ACTION RECOMMENDATION

### Current Position Assessment

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| FV (v3.0, EV weighted) | $29.00 |
| Current price | $29.06 |
| MoS | **-0.2%** (NONE) |
| MoS vs Bear | -8.8% |
| Yield | 6.1% |
| Forward expected return | ~6-8% (yield + low growth) |
| Conviction | LOW |

### Verdict: HOLD ON PROBATION

**Reasoning from principles**:
- **Principio 6 (Sell requires argument)**: Thesis is weakened but not broken. Caesars Regional lease is a real risk but negotiations are ongoing, not concluded. Selling now would crystallize the uncertainty.
- **Principio 9 (Quality gravitates up)**: QS ~60 (Tier B) is below target. This is capital NOT in a compounder. However, Feb 25 earnings in 15 days will provide clarity on Caesars rent, 2026 guidance, and deal pipeline.
- **Principio 4 (Cash as active position)**: With cash at ~25% of portfolio, selling VICI without deployment target would increase cash drag further.

**Decision**: HOLD through Feb 25 earnings. This is a TIME-BOUND decision — not indefinite. The earnings call will reveal:
1. Whether Caesars Regional rent renegotiation is formally disclosed
2. FY2026 AFFO guidance (consensus ~$2.45-$2.50)
3. Acquisition pipeline updates

### Post-Earnings Decision Framework

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| AFFO guidance >=$2.45, no rent cut disclosed | HOLD, review conviction |
| AFFO guidance $2.35-$2.45, rent cut <=5% with compensation | HOLD, reduce FV to $28 |
| AFFO guidance <$2.35 | **SELL** |
| Rent cut >10% without compensation | **SELL (KC#7)** |
| Positive surprise + acquisition announcement | HOLD, possible upgrade to MED conviction |

### Model Disruption Kill Conditions (added 2026-02-11)
| KC#8 | **iGaming/online gambling cannibalize physical casino GGR >15% in any VICI market** — VICI's entire thesis depends on physical casino visits growing. If iGaming (DraftKings, FanDuel, etc.) captures enough gambling spend that tenant GGR declines, rent coverage deteriorates structurally. The Caesars Regional 1.03x coverage is ALREADY fragile — any GGR decline makes it worse. Monitor: AGA iGaming revenue reports, state-by-state online gambling legislation, tenant GGR trends. |
| KC#9 | **Las Vegas visitor count declines >10% YoY for 2+ consecutive years** — The adversarial review found visitors already DOWN 7.5% (thesis said record 42M+). If this is a trend rather than a blip — driven by remote entertainment, economic softness, or international travel shifts — VICI's Las Vegas Strip assets (56% of portfolio) face structural devaluation. Monitor: LVCVA monthly visitor statistics. |

### Standing Orders

| Type | Trigger | Shares | Expiry |
|------|---------|--------|--------|
| SELL (if KC triggered) | See post-earnings framework | All | Feb 28 |
| TRIM | >$32 | 7 shares | Mar 31 |

---

## SECTION 14: AUTOCRITICA

### What v2.0 Got Wrong
1. **LV visitor data was stale/wrong**: Thesis claimed "42M+ annually, record" — actual YTD Nov 2025 was 35.4M annualizing to ~38.6M, declining 7-9% YoY
2. **Rent coverage was not disaggregated**: "1.5-2.0x" hid the fact that Caesars Regional was 1.03x (25% of NOI)
3. **QS was overclaimed by 2 tiers**: Custom 8/10 Tier A vs Tool 54 Tier C (REIT-adjusted ~60 Tier B)
4. **Multiple was too high**: 14x when peers trade at 12-13x and three analysts just downgraded
5. **"Probability I'm wrong: 20%"**: Should have been 35%+ given the concentration risk

### Assumptions I'm Making (and could be wrong about)
1. Caesars Regional rent cut will be -5-10% with partial compensation (could be worse)
2. LV tourism will stabilize (could continue declining with macro/tariff headwinds)
3. Rate cuts in 2026 will support REIT valuations (could be delayed)
4. Management will find accretive acquisitions (pipeline is thin)

### Evidence I May Be Ignoring
1. Sports betting may be cannibalizing regional casino floor revenue (structural, not cyclical)
2. Canadian travel declining and Spirit Airlines capacity cuts specifically affecting LV
3. Caesars total company leverage (~5x) limits their operational flexibility
4. Multiple downgrades often precede further deterioration, not recovery
