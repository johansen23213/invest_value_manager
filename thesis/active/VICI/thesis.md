## 1. Business Overview

VICI Properties is a triple-net lease REIT specializing in experiential real estate, primarily casino and gaming properties. Under the triple-net (NNN) model, tenants bear ALL property-level costs: maintenance, insurance, property taxes, and capital expenditures. VICI simply collects rent.

**Key characteristics of the model:**
- Virtually zero operating expenses at property level
- Predictable, contractual cash flows
- CPI-linked escalators protect against inflation (typically 2% annual bumps or CPI-linked)
- Ultra-long lease terms (average remaining ~30 years)
- AFFO margins above 90% due to NNN structure

**Portfolio (as of Q3 2025):**
- 93 assets across 26 US states + 1 Canadian province
- 14 tenants (diversifying from original Caesars-only structure)
- $3.15B annualized contractual rent
- Properties include Caesars Palace Las Vegas, MGM Grand, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay

**Tenant mix by rent:**
- Caesars Entertainment: ~39%
- MGM Resorts: ~35%
- Other operators: ~26% (including Great Wolf Lodges, Bowlero, Chelsea Piers, Canyon Ranch, Cabot, Clairvest)

## 2. Why We Bought

### 2.1 Valuation

VICI trades at a significant discount to its intrinsic value and to comparable net-lease REITs:

| Metric | VICI | Realty Income (O) | NNN REIT | GLPI |
|--------|------|-------------------|----------|------|
| Price | $28.08 | $61.16 | $41.67 | $44.75 |
| P/E (trailing) | 10.7x | 56.6x | 20.1x | 16.3x |
| Forward P/AFFO* | ~11.9x | ~15x | ~14x | ~13x |
| Dividend Yield | 6.3% | 5.3% | 5.7% | 6.9% |
| Market Cap | $30B | $56B | $8B | $13B |

*VICI 2025 AFFO guidance: $2.36-$2.37/share. At $28.08 price = 11.9x forward P/AFFO.

VICI trades at a ~20% discount to the net-lease sector average P/AFFO of ~14-15x, despite having arguably the highest quality portfolio (iconic, irreplaceable Las Vegas Strip assets with 30+ year leases).

### 2.2 Dividend Income

- Current yield: 6.3% ($1.80/share annual dividend, $0.45/quarter)
- Q3 2025 dividend increased 4.0% YoY
- AFFO payout ratio: ~76% ($1.80 / $2.37 AFFO) -- well covered, room for further raises
- AFFO/share growing 5%+ annually -- dividend growth should follow

### 2.3 Wide Moat

VICI possesses a wide moat driven by multiple factors:

1. **Irreplaceable assets**: Caesars Palace, MGM Grand, The Venetian are not replicable. Las Vegas Strip gaming licenses and land are finite.
2. **Ultra-long leases**: Average ~30 years remaining. Tenants cannot walk away without catastrophic consequences.
3. **CPI escalators**: Rent grows with inflation automatically. No renegotiation needed.
4. **High switching costs**: Moving a casino is physically and economically impossible. Tenant is locked in.
5. **Gaming license barrier**: Regulatory barriers prevent new entrants from easily competing for the same properties.
6. **Tenant credit quality**: Caesars and MGM are both investment-grade or near-investment-grade, publicly traded companies with massive cash flows.

## 3. Fair Value Estimate

### 3.1 AFFO-Based Valuation

**Base case**: 2025E AFFO/share of $2.37.

| Scenario | P/AFFO Multiple | Fair Value | MoS at $28.08 |
|----------|----------------|------------|----------------|
| Bear | 12.0x | $28.44 | 1% |
| Base | 14.0x | $33.18 | 18% |
| Bull | 15.5x | $36.74 | 31% |

**Rationale for 14x base case**: Net-lease REITs with investment-grade tenants and long WALTs typically trade at 14-16x AFFO. VICI deserves at least sector-average given its asset quality, but we apply a small tenant-concentration discount.

### 3.2 Dividend Discount Model

At 6.3% yield with 4-5% annual dividend growth and 9% required return:
- Gordon Growth: $1.80 / (0.09 - 0.045) = $40.00
- Discounted at 10% cost of equity: ~$36.00

### 3.3 Comparable Transaction Analysis

GLPI (closest peer, also gaming NNN) trades at ~13x P/AFFO with similar yield. GLPI has shorter leases, smaller portfolio, and less iconic assets. A 1-turn premium for VICI (14x) is justified.

### 3.4 Summary Fair Value

**Fair Value Estimate: $33-$34/share (midpoint $33.50)**
**Margin of Safety at $28.08: ~16-18%**

This satisfies the Tier A requirement of >=15% MoS for a Quality Score 8/10 wide-moat defensive.

## 4. Key Risks

### 4.1 Tenant Concentration (MEDIUM-HIGH)
- Caesars (39%) + MGM (35%) = 74% of rent from two tenants
- Mitigant: Both are large, profitable public companies. Caesars EBITDA ~$4B, MGM EBITDA ~$4B. Rent coverage ratios are healthy (1.5-2x).
- Mitigant: VICI is actively diversifying (added Clairvest as 14th tenant, expanded into non-gaming experiential)
- Monitoring: Watch Caesars and MGM quarterly results, leverage ratios, and rent coverage

### 4.2 Interest Rate Sensitivity (MEDIUM)
- REITs are sensitive to rising rates. Higher rates increase VICI's cost of capital and make the yield less attractive vs risk-free
- Mitigant: VICI has largely fixed-rate debt, well-laddered maturities, investment-grade balance sheet (BBB-)
- Mitigant: CPI escalators partially offset -- if rates are high because inflation is high, rents rise too
- Current environment: Rates appear stable/declining, which is favorable

### 4.3 Gaming Regulation (LOW-MEDIUM)
- Regulatory changes (sports betting cannibalization, smoking bans, tax increases) could pressure tenant profitability
- Mitigant: VICI's rent is fixed regardless of gaming revenue -- tenant absorbs the operational risk
- Mitigant: Las Vegas is destination-driven, more resilient than regional gaming

### 4.4 Las Vegas Concentration (LOW-MEDIUM)
- Significant exposure to Las Vegas Strip properties
- Mitigant: Las Vegas has proven highly resilient. Visitor volume ~42M annually. Convention, entertainment, and F&B increasingly diversify revenue beyond gaming.

### 4.5 Debt/Refinancing Risk (LOW)
- As a REIT, VICI must distribute 90%+ of taxable income. Growth requires external capital.
- Mitigant: Investment-grade rating, proven capital markets access, conservative leverage (~5.5x Debt/EBITDA)

## 5. Kill Triggers (Sell Immediately)

1. **Caesars or MGM misses rent payment** -- even once. Indicates severe financial distress.
2. **Dividend cut** -- signals AFFO deterioration or balance sheet problems.
3. **AFFO/share declines YoY for 2 consecutive quarters** without clear, temporary explanation.
4. **Debt rating downgraded below BB+** -- loss of investment-grade status.
5. **Major regulatory change** that structurally impairs casino economics (e.g., Las Vegas gaming ban -- extreme but illustrative).
6. **Price reaches fair value ($33-$34)** -- evaluate total return vs alternatives. Not automatic sell but requires reassessment.
