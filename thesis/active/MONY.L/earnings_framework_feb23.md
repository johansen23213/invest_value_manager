## 2. WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW (Pre-Earnings Intelligence)

### 2.1 H1 2025 Results (Released Jul 21, 2025)

| Metric | H1 2025 | H1 2024 | Change |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| Revenue | GBP 225.3m | GBP 223.5m | +1% |
| Adj EBITDA | GBP 75.1m | GBP 73.8m | +2% |
| Profit after tax | GBP 45.6m | GBP 44.4m | +3% |
| Operating profit | GBP 61.2m | GBP 60.6m | +1% |

**Segment Detail (H1 2025):**

| Segment | Revenue | % Total | YoY | Commentary |
|---------|---------|---------|-----|------------|
| Insurance | GBP 117.7m | 52% | -2% | Motor premiums falling, headwind |
| Money | GBP 55m | 24% | +3% | Credit cards and banking recovery |
| Home Services | GBP 30m | 13% | +5% | Energy switching driving growth |
| Travel | GBP 15m | 7% | +8% | Post-COVID recovery |
| Cashback (Quidco) | GBP 7.6m | 3% | +2% | Stable |

### 2.2 December 2025 Trading Statement (Dec 3, 2025)

Key signals from the most recent corporate update:

1. **Revenue and EBITDA growth continued in H2** despite insurance headwinds
2. **Insurance:** "Gradual easing of trading headwinds in motor" -- motor premiums falling (-16% YoY by Sep 2025) reduces per-click value but MONY's diversity helps
3. **Money:** "Continued good growth in borrowing" -- credit card deals and current account switching promotions driving volumes
4. **Home Services/Energy:** Strong -- first collective energy switch since 2021 launched in October with MSE support
5. **SuperSaveClub:** Reached 2 million members, "contributing materially to Group revenue"
6. **ITG:** Moved from controlling to minority stake (reducing complexity)
7. **Guidance CONFIRMED:** Adj EBITDA for FY25 in line with consensus

### 2.3 Consensus Estimates (As of Dec 2025)

| Metric | Consensus | Range | Source |
|--------|-----------|-------|--------|
| FY2025 Adj EBITDA | GBP 142.7m | GBP 136.5m - 144.9m | MarketScreener |
| FY2025 Revenue (implied) | ~GBP 447-455m | Extrapolated from H1 + H2 momentum | Analyst estimates |
| FY2026 Adj EBITDA | GBP ~148-155m | Limited data | Early estimates |

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Consensus was revised DOWN during 2025:
- Feb 2025 consensus EBITDA: GBP 147.0m (range 143.1-151.7m)
- Dec 2025 consensus EBITDA: GBP 142.7m (range 136.5-144.9m)
- Delta: -GBP 4.3m (-2.9%)

This downward revision reflects the insurance premium headwinds and slower growth.

### 2.4 UK Motor Insurance Premium Context

This is CRITICAL for understanding the Insurance segment (52% of revenue):

| Period | Premium Trend | Impact on MONY |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| Q1 2025 | -GBP 42 per policy | Reduced per-click revenue |
| Q2 2025 | -GBP 16 per policy | Continued pressure |
| Q3 2025 | -GBP 13 per policy | Easing somewhat |
| Full 2025 | -16% YoY (WTW) | Significant headwind |
| 2026 outlook | +3% expected (CI) | Potential tailwind reversal |

**Key dynamic:** Falling premiums reduce MONY's revenue per transaction (commission is % of premium), but can INCREASE switching activity (consumers shop more when prices change). The Dec trading statement noted "gradual easing" suggesting the worst may be behind.

### 2.5 Analyst Sentiment

| Analyst | Rating | Target | Date | Commentary |
|---------|--------|--------|------|------------|
| Berenberg | BUY | 275p | Feb 10 | AI impact overstated, FCA regulatory protection |
| Morgan Stanley | Equal Weight | 220p (lowered from 315p on Jan 21) | Jan 21 | AI concerns, EPS cuts 4-5% |
| RBC | N/A | N/A | Feb 10 | MONY "well placed" to develop own AI apps |
| Consensus avg | -- | 237p | -- | High 280p, Low 173p |

## 3. KEY METRICS TO WATCH

### 3.1 Revenue (KILL CONDITION KC#1)

```
KC#1: Revenue < GBP 435m --> SELL

Context:
- FY2024 actual: GBP 439.2m
- H1 2025: GBP 225.3m (+1% YoY)
- Dec statement: H2 growth continued
- Implied FY2025 range: GBP 445-455m

EXPECTATION: Revenue GBP 447-455m (slightly above FY2024)
KC#1 trigger (GBP 435m) would require H2 revenue < GBP 210m = UNLIKELY
unless there was a sharp Q4 deterioration not signaled in Dec update.
```

### 3.2 Insurance Segment Revenue (KILL CONDITION KC#2)

```
KC#2: Insurance segment -5%+ in H2 2025 --> SELL

Context:
- H1 2025 Insurance: GBP 117.7m (-2% YoY)
- H1 2024 Insurance: GBP 120.2m
- FY2024 Insurance: GBP 240m (estimated)
- H2 2024 Insurance: ~GBP 120m (estimated)
- Dec statement: "Gradual easing of trading headwinds in motor"

EXPECTATION: Insurance H2 2025 in range GBP 115-122m (-4% to +2%)
KC#2 trigger (-5% = GBP 114m or less) is possible but Dec statement signals easing.
WATCH: Insurance revenue disclosure and management commentary on motor premium trends.
```

### 3.3 Adjusted EBITDA

```
Company guided: "In line with consensus" (GBP 142.7m, range 136.5-144.9m)

Context:
- FY2024 EBITDA: GBP 140.2m (MONY guided to this previously)
- Consensus FY2025: GBP 142.7m (+1.8% YoY)
- H1 2025 EBITDA: GBP 75.1m

EXPECTATION: GBP 141-145m (in line with guidance)
If BELOW GBP 136.5m (bottom of range): RED FLAG -- guidance miss
If ABOVE GBP 145m: POSITIVE surprise
```

### 3.4 Dividend (KILL CONDITION KC#3)

```
KC#3: Dividend cut --> SELL

Context:
- FY2024 dividend: 12.13p per share (est)
- Current yield: 8.4% at 148p
- Payout ratio: 82% of earnings
- FCF cover: ~GBP 102m FCF vs ~GBP 63m dividend = 1.6x covered
- 17 consecutive years of payment
- Net cash position (GBP 29m cash vs GBP 66m debt)

EXPECTATION: Dividend maintained or marginally increased
Probability of cut: LOW (5-10%). FCF and balance sheet support it.
If CUT: Immediate SELL regardless of other metrics.
```

### 3.5 AI Strategy (KILL CONDITION KC#9 -- NEW)

```
KC#9: Management fails to articulate credible AI strategy --> 30-day exit process

This is the SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT qualitative signal from earnings.

WHAT CONSTITUTES "CREDIBLE":
- Specific AI product/partnership (not just internal chatbots)
- Budget/investment allocation for AI defense
- Concrete timeline for AI-augmented comparison product
- Partnership discussions with OpenAI/Google/Anthropic
- Data on AI-driven customer interactions

WHAT CONSTITUTES "FAILURE":
- Dismissive of AI threat ("we don't see it as an issue")
- Generic AI mentions without specifics ("we're investing in AI")
- No mention of agentic AI / ChatGPT-style disruption
- No budget or timeline for AI response
- Defensive "our brand is strong enough" without evidence

GRAY ZONE:
- Acknowledgment of threat + early-stage response + no specific product yet
- In this case: 60-day extended probation with specific milestones
```

### 3.6 Traffic and Engagement Metrics

```
WHAT TO WATCH:
- Total visits / unique visitors (if disclosed)
- MSE traffic (21.7M/month as of H1 -- any change?)
- SuperSaveClub membership growth (was 2M in Dec 2025)
- App downloads / engagement
- Organic vs paid traffic split

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Nov 2025 Similarweb showed -8.82% MoM traffic decline
- If confirmed in full-year data, validates concern about structural traffic loss
- If reversed, suggests Nov was anomalous

KC#4: Organic traffic -15% YoY for 2+ quarters --> approaching trigger
```

### 3.7 FY2026 Guidance

```
WHAT TO WATCH:
- Revenue growth guidance
- EBITDA guidance range
- Capital allocation priorities (AI investment vs dividends vs buybacks)
- Insurance segment outlook
- Any mention of energy market opportunity (Ofgem price cap changes)

EXPECTATIONS:
- Revenue +3-5% (motor premium recovery + money growth + energy switching)
- EBITDA GBP 148-155m
- Maintained or increased dividend
- Capex 3-4% of revenue

If guidance BELOW consensus: NEGATIVE
If guidance AT or ABOVE consensus: NEUTRAL to POSITIVE
```

## 4. EARNINGS SCENARIOS

### 4.1 BEAR SCENARIO (Probability: 20%)

**What happens:**
- Revenue below GBP 440m (near-flat vs FY2024 GBP 439m)
- Insurance segment revenue down -4% or worse in H2
- EBITDA below GBP 140m (miss vs guidance)
- No meaningful AI strategy articulated
- FY2026 guidance cautious or cut
- Dividend maintained but no increase
- Traffic decline confirmed in annual data

**Why this matters:**
- Insurance headwinds worse than Dec statement suggested
- Growth story breaks down (revenue flat despite "easing headwinds")
- No AI defense = existential risk recognized but unaddressed
- Market likely pushes stock toward 120-130p (bear FV 133p)

**ACTION IF BEAR:**

```
IF Revenue < GBP 435m --> SELL (KC#1 triggered)
IF Insurance H2 -5%+ --> SELL (KC#2 triggered)
IF No AI strategy at ALL --> Begin 30-day EXIT (KC#9 triggered)

IF Revenue GBP 435-440m + weak AI + cautious guidance:
  --> 30-DAY PROBATION with EXIT at 130p
  --> Calculate realized loss: ~-22% (~EUR 77 loss on EUR 347 position)
  --> Accept loss as capital preservation
  --> Document in decisions_log.yaml
  --> Free up ~EUR 347 for pipeline (ROP at $300, DNLM.L at 780p)
```

**Estimated P&L impact:** Loss of EUR 50-80 (depending on exit price 130-140p)

### 4.2 BASE SCENARIO (Probability: 50%)

**What happens:**
- Revenue GBP 445-455m (+1-3% YoY)
- Insurance segment flat to -2% H2 (in line with H1 trajectory)
- EBITDA GBP 141-145m (in line with consensus GBP 142.7m)
- AI mentioned but with generic strategy (early-stage, acknowledging threat)
- FY2026 guidance: EBITDA GBP 148-155m, revenue +3-5%
- Dividend maintained at 12.1-12.5p
- SuperSaveClub growing past 2.5M members
- Traffic data mixed

**Why this matters:**
- Business fundamentals intact but growth is tepid
- AI response is in progress but not yet concrete
- The core thesis (ROIC 31.8% >> WACC, net cash, quality financials) remains
- But the AI threat cloud does not lift

**ACTION IF BASE:**

```
EARNINGS DATA is acceptable but AI strategy is the deciding factor:

IF AI strategy is acknowledged + specific plans + budget:
  --> HOLD: Extend probation 90 days (to May 23, 2026)
  --> Maintain FV at 190 GBp
  --> Monitor: March traffic data, AI product progress
  --> Conviction stays LOW but probation has clear endpoint

IF AI strategy is generic/vague:
  --> EXTENDED PROBATION 60 DAYS (exit by April 24, 2026)
  --> Set hard exit trigger at 130 GBp
  --> If no AI progress by April 24 --> SELL
  --> Rationale: Base fundamentals OK but existential risk unaddressed
```

### 4.3 BULL SCENARIO (Probability: 20%)

**What happens:**
- Revenue above GBP 455m (+4% YoY)
- Insurance segment flat or positive in H2 (motor premium recovery beginning)
- EBITDA GBP 145m+ (beat consensus)
- Concrete AI strategy with partnership, product, or acquisition
- FY2026 guidance confident: EBITDA GBP 155m+, revenue +5-7%
- Dividend increase (12.5p+ per share)
- SuperSaveClub 3M+ members with clear monetization path
- Energy switching strong (collective switch program expanding)
- Traffic growth or stabilization demonstrated

**Why this matters:**
- Business proving resilient despite AI fears
- Management proactively addressing AI threat
- Insurance headwind reversing (2026 premiums +3% expected)
- Multiple re-rating catalyst emerges (P/E 9.9x to 12-14x plausible)

**ACTION IF BULL:**

```
--> UPGRADE conviction to MEDIUM
--> REMOVE PROBATION
--> Maintain FV at 190 GBp (re-evaluate upward at next review)
--> Consider ADD if price stays below 155p (MoS >18%)
  BUT: No ADD immediately -- wait for sustained confirmation
  Re-evaluate at Q1 2026 trading update
--> Update exit_plan: standard Tier A monitoring
--> Set price alert at 190p (approaching FV)
```

### 4.4 BLACK SWAN SCENARIO (Probability: 10%)

**What happens:**
- Dividend CUT (KC#3)
- OR Revenue below GBP 430m (major miss)
- OR Management announces strategic review / potential sale
- OR ChatGPT/Gemini UK insurance app announced concurrently
- OR Major data breach / FCA enforcement

**ACTION:**

```
--> SELL IMMEDIATELY
--> Do not wait for analysis
--> Exit at market open Monday Feb 24 (or Tuesday if results are Sunday)
--> Accept realized loss
--> Document in decisions_log.yaml
```

## 6. POST-EARNINGS DECISION TREE (COMPREHENSIVE)

```
EARNINGS RELEASE: Sunday Feb 23 / Monday Feb 24 pre-market

STEP 1: CHECK KILL CONDITIONS
|
+--> KC#1: Revenue < GBP 435m?
|    YES --> SELL Monday market open. No further analysis.
|
+--> KC#2: Insurance H2 revenue -5%+ vs H2 2024?
|    YES --> SELL Monday market open. No further analysis.
|
+--> KC#3: Dividend cut or omitted?
|    YES --> SELL Monday market open. No further analysis.
|
+--> ALL KCs CLEAR --> Continue to Step 2
|
STEP 2: ASSESS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
|
+--> EBITDA below GBP 136.5m (bottom of consensus range)?
|    YES --> RED FLAG. Guidance missed. Proceed with extreme caution.
|           Likely SELL unless AI strategy is exceptionally strong.
|
+--> EBITDA GBP 136.5-140m (weak but within range)?
|    --> WEAK BASE. Need strong AI strategy to offset.
|
+--> EBITDA GBP 140-145m (in line)?
|    --> BASE CASE confirmed. Proceed to Step 3.
|
+--> EBITDA above GBP 145m (beat)?
|    --> POSITIVE surprise. Proceed to Step 3 with favorable bias.
|
STEP 3: ASSESS AI STRATEGY (KC#9 -- DECISIVE)
|
+--> TIER 1 AI RESPONSE (Credible, funded, specific):
|    Examples:
|    - Partnership with OpenAI/Google/Anthropic announced or in development
|    - Own AI comparison product in beta or launched
|    - Specific budget (>GBP 5m) allocated to AI defense
|    - Concrete timeline (product by H2 2026)
|    - Evidence of AI-driven traffic or revenue growth
|    |
|    Combined with:
|    - EBITDA in line/beat --> UPGRADE to HOLD MEDIUM conviction
|    - EBITDA weak --> HOLD LOW conviction, 90-day probation
|
+--> TIER 2 AI RESPONSE (Acknowledged, early-stage, generic):
|    Examples:
|    - "We are exploring AI opportunities"
|    - Internal AI tools mentioned (Amazon Bedrock, Claude agents)
|    - No specific external-facing AI product
|    - No partnership or budget disclosed
|    - Acknowledgment of Insurify but no specific response
|    |
|    Combined with:
|    - EBITDA in line/beat --> EXTENDED PROBATION 60 days
|                              Exit trigger: 130 GBp
|                              Hard deadline: April 24, 2026
|    - EBITDA weak --> SELL within 30 days
|
+--> TIER 3 AI RESPONSE (Dismissive, absent, no plan):
|    Examples:
|    - No mention of agentic AI threat
|    - "Our brand protects us"
|    - "We don't see AI as a material risk"
|    - Actively dismissing Insurify relevance
|    |
|    --> KC#9 TRIGGERED
|    --> SELL within 30 days regardless of financial performance
|    --> A management team that doesn't see the threat is the threat
|
STEP 4: ASSESS FY2026 GUIDANCE
|
+--> Guidance above consensus (EBITDA >GBP 148m)?
|    --> POSITIVE signal. Factor into conviction upgrade.
|
+--> Guidance at consensus (GBP 145-148m)?
|    --> NEUTRAL. Consistent with base case.
|
+--> Guidance below consensus or cautious language?
|    --> NEGATIVE signal. Factor into downgrade.
|
STEP 5: SYNTHESIZE AND DECIDE
|
+--> SELL signals:
|    - Any KC triggered
|    - EBITDA miss + no AI strategy
|    - Tier 3 AI response (regardless of financials)
|    - Dividend cut
|    |
|    ACTION: SELL Monday/Tuesday
|    Calculate loss: ~204 shares x (entry - exit) x GBP/EUR
|    Document in decisions_log.yaml
|    Free capital for pipeline
|
+--> HOLD signals:
|    - Financials in line + Tier 2 AI response
|    - Set EXIT deadline (60 or 90 days depending on strength)
|    - Set hard exit trigger price (130 GBp)
|    - Monitor: traffic data, AI product progress, motor premium trend
|    - NO ADD while on probation
|
+--> UPGRADE signals:
|    - Financials beat + Tier 1 AI response + strong guidance
|    - Remove probation
|    - Raise conviction to MEDIUM
|    - Maintain FV at 190 GBp
|    - Consider ADD evaluation at next quarterly review (not immediately)
```

## 7. CRITICAL QUESTIONS FOR EARNINGS CALL

### Financial Questions

## 8. PRECEDENT ANALYSIS

### Comparable Situations in Our Portfolio

| Situation | Ticker | What Happened | What We Did | Result |
|-----------|--------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Post-earnings with moat threat | AUTO.L | Dealer revolt, 180+ downgrades, moat siege | HOLD LOW conviction, waiting April pricing event | Pending |
| Earnings-driven probation | VICI | Gaming concentration, types not falling | HOLD ON PROBATION through Feb 25 earnings | Pending |
| Earnings miss + weak thesis | TEP.PA | AI disruption accelerating, ROIC < WACC | SELL (rotated to BYIT.L Tier A) | +EUR freed |
| Quality company at panic low | NVO | -17% in 2 days on guidance shock | BUY at MoS 38% | Pending |

**Key distinction for MONY.L:**
- ROIC 31.8% >> WACC 9.2% -- this DISTINGUISHES MONY from every position we sold (ALL had ROIC < WACC)
- However, the AI threat is to FUTURE ROIC, not current ROIC
- The question is: does current exceptional profitability persist, or is AI about to structurally impair it?
- Earnings give us DATA to answer this question (traffic, AI strategy, guidance)

### Anchoring Bias Warning

We are holding a -12.3% loss on this position. I must be explicit: the loss must NOT influence the decision. The relevant question is "given the data from earnings, should this capital be HERE or somewhere else?" not "can we recover the loss?"

If earnings deliver BASE or BEAR scenario with weak AI strategy, the correct action is EXIT even at a loss. The precedent is clear: HRB was held at a loss, then ADDed to at $35, then sold at $32.77 for -13.25%. Holding and hoping cost MORE than cutting losses.

---

## 9. POSITION MATH: SELL SCENARIOS

### If we SELL at various prices:

| Exit Price (GBp) | Position Value (EUR) | P&L vs Invested (EUR) | P&L % |
|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------|
| 130p | ~304 | ~-96 | ~-24% |
| 140p | ~328 | ~-72 | ~-18% |
| 148p (current) | ~347 | ~-53 | ~-13% |
| 155p | ~363 | ~-37 | ~-10% |
| 160p | ~375 | ~-25 | ~-6% |

**Portfolio impact of SELL at 140p:** Loss of ~EUR 72. Portfolio EUR 10,063 - EUR 72 = EUR 9,991 (-0.7% portfolio impact). This is MANAGEABLE.

**Capital freed for redeployment:** ~EUR 328 at 140p. Available for:
- ROP standing order at $300 (closest trigger, 6.6% away)
- DNLM.L standing order at 780p (approved pipeline)
- Cash reserve (currently 48.1%, this would marginally increase)

---

## 10. TIMING AND LOGISTICS

### Earnings Release Schedule
- **Expected:** Sunday Feb 23, 2026 (preliminary results typically released Sunday/Monday pre-market)
- **Analyst call:** Likely Monday Feb 24 morning (UK time)
- **Note:** MONY.L last year released preliminary FY2024 on Monday Feb 17, 2025 (pre-market)
- **eToro trading:** Available from market open (~08:00 UK / 09:00 CET)

### Action Plan
1. **Feb 23 evening (if Sunday release):** Review headline numbers vs kill conditions. Prepare action for Monday.
2. **Feb 24 morning:** If KC triggered, instruct human to SELL at market open. If not, wait for analyst call.
3. **Feb 24 post-call:** Full assessment using decision tree above. Determine SELL / HOLD / UPGRADE.
4. **Feb 24 end of day:** Update thesis/active/MONY.L/thesis.md with v4.0 post-earnings assessment.
5. **If SELL:** Update portfolio/current.yaml, portfolio/history.yaml, decisions_log.yaml.
6. **If HOLD:** Update exit_plan with new probation deadline and trigger prices.

## 11. CONTEXT: OTHER EARNINGS SAME WEEK

This is a heavy earnings week for our portfolio:

| Date | Ticker | Position | Key Questions |
|------|--------|----------|---------------|
| **Feb 23** | **MONY.L** | **ON PROBATION** | **AI strategy, insurance revenue** |
| Feb 24 | EDEN.PA | HOLD | FY2025 results, France regulation update |
| Feb 25 | VICI | ON PROBATION | AFFO guidance, Caesars lease |
| Feb 25-26 | UHS | ON PROBATION | FY2026 EPS guide, Medicaid impact |
| Feb 26 | DTE.DE | HOLD | TMUS contribution, FY2026 guidance |

**Capital allocation consideration:** If MONY.L, VICI, and UHS all deliver SELL signals, we could be freeing up ~EUR 900+ of capital (MONY ~350 + VICI ~500 + UHS ~340). This plus existing cash (EUR 4,844) would give us EUR 5,700+ to deploy. The pipeline must be ready:
- ROP at $300 (approved, closest trigger)
- DNLM.L at 780p (approved)
- DSY.PA at EUR 15.50 (approved, waiting Q1 2026)

---

## 12. SUMMARY: WHAT TO DO ON FEB 23

```
1. READ THE NUMBERS FIRST, REACT SECOND

2. CHECK KILL CONDITIONS (#1, #2, #3) -- if ANY triggered, SELL Monday

3. IF KCs CLEAR:
   - Assess EBITDA vs consensus (GBP 142.7m)
   - Assess AI strategy quality (Tier 1 / Tier 2 / Tier 3)
   - Assess FY2026 guidance
   - Follow decision tree in Section 6

4. THE AI STRATEGY IS THE SWING FACTOR
   - Good financials + Tier 3 AI = SELL
   - Weak financials + Tier 1 AI = HOLD (barely)
   - Good financials + Tier 1 AI = UPGRADE
   - Weak financials + no AI = SELL

5. DO NOT let the -12% unrealized loss influence the decision
   - The question is: "Is this capital best deployed here or elsewhere?"
   - With 48% cash and approved pipeline, alternatives exist

6. DOCUMENT EVERYTHING in thesis v4.0 post-earnings

## META-REFLECTION

### Cambios detectados desde ultima revision (Feb 12 --> Feb 13)
- **MINOR:** Price moved from 146.1 GBp to 148.35 GBp (+1.5%). P/E now 9.9x (was 9.7x). No material change.
- **NEW DATA:** December 2025 trading statement confirms H2 trading "in line" with consensus. SuperSaveClub at 2M members. Energy switching strong. Insurance "gradually easing."
- **NEW DATA:** UK motor premiums fell -16% full year 2025, but expected to rise +3% in 2026 (Consumer Intelligence). This is a potential positive catalyst for MONY's insurance segment in FY2026.
- **ANALYST CONTEXT:** Consensus FY2025 EBITDA revised DOWN from GBP 147m to GBP 142.7m during 2025. This means a "in-line" result has a lower bar than initially feared.

### Incertidumbres
1. **Cannot determine if results release Sunday or Monday.** MONY historically releases on weekday mornings. Need to check investor relations calendar closer to date.
2. **AI strategy quality is entirely unpredictable.** This is the single biggest unknown. Management has not publicly discussed agentic AI threats since Insurify (Feb 10). Two weeks is short for a strategic response.
3. **Motor premium reversal timing.** If 2026 premiums rise +3%, this would be a meaningful tailwind. But the timing of when this feeds through to MONY's revenue is uncertain (policy renewal cycles are spread across the year).
4. **SuperSaveClub monetization.** "Contributing materially" is vague. We need specific revenue numbers or per-member economics to assess whether this is a real growth engine or marketing.
5. **FCA regulatory stance.** No signal either way on AI-mediated insurance regulation. This could go either direction.

### Sugerencias
1. **Set calendar reminder for Feb 22 evening** to check for pre-release (some UK companies release RNS on Friday evening before results).
2. **Prepare portfolio-ops agent** with pre-drafted exit transaction if SELL is needed (ticker, shares, reason).
3. **Cross-reference with EDEN.PA earnings Feb 24** -- if both disappoint, UK/EU consumer services sector may be under broader pressure.

### Alertas para Orchestrator
1. **MONY.L is the FIRST earnings event of the critical week (Feb 23-26).** How this resolves sets the tone for VICI, UHS, and DTE.DE decisions. If MONY delivers a clean SELL signal, it simplifies the week (less capital tied up in probation positions).
2. **The Dec trading statement data is NET POSITIVE for base case.** Consensus was revised DOWN to GBP 142.7m, and management confirmed "in line." This means the bar for a base-case result is achievable. The risk is on the AI strategy side, not the financial side.
3. **Motor premium reversal in 2026 (+3%) is an underappreciated catalyst.** If management can articulate this tailwind alongside an AI strategy, the bull case becomes more plausible.
4. **The position is small (~3.4%, EUR 347).** Even a full loss would be ~-EUR 100, or -1% of portfolio. This is bounded risk. The decision should be based on INFORMATION QUALITY, not loss aversion.
