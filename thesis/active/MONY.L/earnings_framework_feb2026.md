## 1. POSICION ACTUAL (actualizado 12-Feb-2026)

| Metrica | Valor |
|---------|-------|
| Shares | 204 |
| Avg Cost | 232 GBp |
| Current Price | ~146 GBp |
| Position % | ~3.2% |

| MoS vs Base FV | 23.1% |

| Status | ON PROBATION |
| Conviction | LOW |

**CRITICAL CONTEXT:** Insurify launched ChatGPT insurance comparison app (Feb 9-10). Stock crashed to 147p (13-year low). Proof-of-concept that AI can replace price comparison. BUT: US-only, car-only, cannot transact, no FCA authorization for UK. UK regulatory barriers provide 2-3 year buffer.

## 7. CONTEXTO FRAMEWORK v4.0 (UPDATED)

**Precedentes relevantes (decisions_log.yaml):**
- AUTO.L (moat under active siege): HOLD LOW, April 2026 pricing = make-or-break. Parallel but AUTO faces ACTIVE revolt, MONY faces POTENTIAL disruption.
- BYIT.L (Microsoft EA structural risk): HOLD PROBATION LOW. Similar "wait for data" approach.
- SHEL.L → sold when better alternative appeared. We now have alternatives (PAYC, MORN, DSY.PA).

**Principios aplicables:**
- P6: Vender requiere argumento — selling at 13-year low on a US product not in UK market = weak argument
- P5: QS 75 (adj) borderline Tier A — deserves one more data point (earnings)
- P7: Consistencia — AUTO.L HOLD through make-or-break, MONY should HOLD through earnings
- P9: Quality Gravitation — if earnings disappoint, this drops to Tier B and competes with pipeline candidates (PAYC QS 80, MORN QS 83)

**Razonamiento pre-comprometido:**
MONY.L at QS 75 (borderline Tier A) with MoS 23% vs base FV, but -10% vs bear FV. The ROIC of 31.8% >> WACC 9.2% distinguishes from sell precedents (every sold position had ROIC<WACC or structural deterioration confirmed). Earnings Feb 23 provide ACTUAL data vs. market speculation about AI. The rational approach: wait for data, then decide. If data confirms deterioration: exit immediately. If data is solid + AI strategy: upgrade.

**RISK ACKNOWLEDGMENT:** With AUTO.L also facing moat siege, 2 of 4 UK positions have degraded moats. If MONY earnings disappoint, consider whether BOTH UK digital platform positions should be trimmed to reduce correlated risk.
