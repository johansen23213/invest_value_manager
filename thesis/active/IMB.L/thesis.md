## 2. Why We Bought

### 2a. Valuation is Compelling

| Metric | IMB.L | Sector Avg |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Forward P/E | 8.1x | 12-14x |
| EV/EBITDA | 8.5x | 10-12x |
| Dividend Yield | 5.3% | 3-4% |
| FCF Yield | ~10.3% | 5-7% |

At 8.1x forward earnings, the stock prices in zero growth and significant risk. Any continuation of the current trajectory (mid-single-digit profit growth + buybacks) is upside not priced in.

### 2b. Total Shareholder Return ~16%/year

The return math is straightforward and does not require heroic assumptions:

| Component | Contribution |
|-----------|-------------|
| Dividend yield | 5.3% |
| Buyback yield (GBP 1.45B / GBP 24.2B cap) | ~6.0% |
| Organic EPS growth (adj OP +3-5% + buyback accretion) | 4-5% |
| **Total expected return** | **~15-16%** |

This is an equity-like return with bond-like volatility (beta 0.15). The Sharpe ratio implied is exceptional.

### 2c. Quality Score 9.5/10 (Tier A)

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| ROE >15% consistently | 1/1 | ROE 22-39% (yfinance: 38.7%) |
| FCF positive 5+ years | 1/1 | GBP 2.5-2.7B annually, highly stable |
| Debt manageable | 0.5/1 | D/E 189%, but Debt/EBITDA ~2.5x, well-covered by FCF |
| Dividend 10+ years uncut | 1/1 | Progressive policy, +4.5% increase FY25 |
| Wide moat | 1/1 | Brand loyalty, regulatory barriers, addiction economics |
| Revenue stability | 1/1 | Max drawdown <5% even in recessions |
| Management quality | 1/1 | GBP 10B+ returned since FY21, disciplined capital allocation |
| Analyst coverage >10 | 1/1 | Well-covered by sell-side |
| Market cap >EUR 10B | 1/1 | ~EUR 28B |
| Defensive sector | 1/1 | Consumer staples (tobacco) |
| **Total** | **9.5/10** | **Tier A confirmed** |

## 3. Fair Value Estimate

### Method 1: Earnings-Based (Primary)

- Forward EPS consensus: ~376p (GBP 3.76)
- Fair multiple for tobacco with mid-single-digit growth: 10-11x
- Fair value range: 3,760p - 4,140p
- Midpoint: **3,950p**

### Method 2: Dividend Discount Model

- Current dividend: 160.32p, growing ~4.5%/year
- Required return: 9% (conservative for Tier A defensive)
- DDM value = 160.32 * 1.045 / (0.09 - 0.045) = **3,723p**

### Method 3: Total Return / Yield-Based

- If the market re-rates to a 4.5% yield (from current 5.3%):
- Fair price = 160.32p / 0.045 = **3,562p**
- At 4.0% yield: 160.32 / 0.04 = **4,008p**

### Method 4: Analyst Consensus

- Consensus target: **3,527p** (+15% from current)
- Consensus rating: BUY

### Synthesis

| Method | Fair Value |
|--------|-----------|
| Earnings (10-11x) | 3,760-4,140p |
| DDM (9% required) | 3,723p |
| Yield re-rating (4.5%) | 3,562p |
| Analyst consensus | 3,527p |
| **Adopted fair value** | **3,650-3,800p** |

**Margin of Safety at 3,066p entry: 16-19%** (meets Tier A >=15% requirement)

## 4. Moat Assessment

**Rating: WIDE MOAT**

1. **Addiction economics**: Nicotine creates physiological dependency. Price elasticity of demand for cigarettes is -0.3 to -0.5, meaning a 10% price increase loses only 3-5% volume. This is the strongest moat in consumer goods.

2. **Regulatory barriers to entry**: No new tobacco companies can realistically enter major markets. Advertising bans, plain packaging, and licensing requirements protect incumbents. Regulation that hurts the industry paradoxically strengthens the moat by preventing competition.

3. **Brand loyalty**: Even in plain-packaging markets, consumers maintain brand preferences. Switching rates among adult smokers are very low.

4. **Scale and distribution**: Global distribution network spanning 120+ markets is irreplicable. Relationships with retailers and distributors built over decades.

5. **NGP optionality**: The transition to reduced-risk products creates a second growth vector while leveraging existing distribution and consumer relationships. This is free optionality at current valuation.

---

## 5. Key Risks

### 5a. Structural Volume Decline (MEDIUM)
- Cigarette volumes declining 2-4% annually in developed markets
- **Mitigant**: Pricing power more than offsets volume decline. FY25 tobacco revenue +3.7% despite volume decline. This has been true for 20+ years.

### 5b. Regulatory Risk (MEDIUM)
- Potential flavor bans, nicotine caps, generational smoking bans (NZ model, now partly reversed)
- **Mitigant**: Historically, regulation has strengthened incumbents by raising barriers. Any extreme regulation would be phased over years/decades, allowing adaptation.

### 5c. ESG/Exclusion Risk (LOW-MEDIUM)
- Some institutional investors divesting from tobacco
- **Mitigant**: Already largely priced in (explains the low multiple). Index inclusion remains. ESG divestment has been ongoing for years without material impact on stock.

### 5d. Leverage (LOW-MEDIUM)
- D/E 189%, total debt GBP 10.3B
- **Mitigant**: Debt/EBITDA ~2.5x, FCF of GBP 2.7B covers debt service easily. Interest coverage comfortable. Tobacco FCF is among the most stable of any industry.

### 5e. NGP Execution (LOW)
- Risk that NGP investments fail to gain scale
- **Mitigant**: Asset-light approach limits downside. NGP already growing 13.7%. Even if NGP fails entirely, the combustible business alone justifies current valuation.

### 5f. Currency Risk (LOW)
- GBP-denominated stock, USD portfolio
- **Mitigant**: Imperial's revenue is globally diversified, providing natural hedging. Position is 5% of portfolio, limiting FX impact.

## 6. Kill Triggers (Sell Immediately If)

1. **Dividend cut**: Would signal fundamental deterioration in cash flow. Sell immediately, no second chances.
2. **Debt/EBITDA exceeds 4.0x**: Would indicate unsustainable leverage for a declining-volume business.
3. **FCF drops below GBP 1.5B for two consecutive years**: Would undermine the entire return thesis.
4. **Global nicotine prohibition legislation passes in any G7 country**: Existential risk, albeit extremely unlikely.
5. **Major market loss (>5pp share) in two or more priority markets simultaneously**: Would indicate brand/execution failure.
6. **Price reaches fair value (3,650-3,800p)**: Re-evaluate thesis. If growth continues, raise target. If not, trim or exit.

## 7. Key Dates and Monitoring

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Q1 2026 (est. Feb) | H1 FY26 Trading Update |
| Mar 31, 2026 | Final dividend payment (40.08p, subject to AGM approval) |
| May 2026 (est.) | H1 FY26 Results |
| Oct 28, 2026 | GBP 1.45B buyback completion deadline |
| Nov 2026 (est.) | FY26 Full Year Results |

**Quarterly review**: Check pricing vs volume trends, NGP growth rate, buyback execution pace, debt trajectory.

---

## 8. Position Management

- **Current allocation**: 5% (within 7% max limit)
- **Add more below**: 2,800p (would increase MoS to >25%)
- **Trim at**: 3,650p (low end of fair value)
- **Full exit at**: 4,000p+ (unless thesis improves)
- **Stop-loss**: None. This is a value position with strong fundamentals. Temporary price declines are buying opportunities, not sell signals.
