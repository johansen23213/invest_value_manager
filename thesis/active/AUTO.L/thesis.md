## TL;DR

AutoTrader Group is the dominant online car classifieds platform in the UK with 75%+ of all automotive classified minutes and 10x larger than its nearest competitor. **QS Tool 63, Adjusted 71/100 (Tier B, high-end)** -- downgraded from original 79 (Tier A) by adversarial review due to EPS data gaps and moat under siege. Exceptional financials remain intact: 50% FCF margin, near-zero debt, +42pp ROIC spread, and 62% operating margin. Stock at 470p, hitting new 52-week low (468.6p on Feb 10). Dealer revolt is intensifying: 180+ downgrades, Jefferies/Berenberg downgrades, April pricing event at 5.5% (vs 8% prior year). **Revised FV 580p (down from 617p adversarial), MoS 19.0%.** HOLD with LOW conviction pending April 2026 pricing event. Position small (3.4%) and loss manageable.

## Quality Score

### QS Tool: 63/100 (Tier B) -- data gaps in GM and EPS for 2025
### QS Adjusted: 71/100 (Tier B, high-end)

**Adjustment reasoning (+8 points):**
- GM Premium: +10 pts (tool scores 0 due to nan in 2025; actual GM 72-84% vs 50% sector = +22-34pp premium)
- Market Position: +8 pts (tool scores 0 default; actual #1 UK auto classifieds by 10x margin, 75%+ market share)
- Offset: EPS CAGR unverifiable (nan in 2025), scored 0 by tool -- partially valid, cannot inflate

**No further QS change from adversarial (Feb 11).** The Deal Builder revolt does not change the CURRENT financial metrics -- ROIC, FCF margin, leverage all intact. The risk is FORWARD-looking: if pricing power erodes, future QS will decline. But today, the tool correctly scores Financial Quality 40/40.

### Quality Score Breakdown (Adversarial-Adjusted)

| Category | Tool | Adjusted | Thesis (original) | Max |
|----------|------|----------|-------------------|-----|
| Financial Quality | 40 | 40 | 39 | 40 |
| Growth Quality | 11 | 11 | 13 | 25 |
| Moat Evidence | 7 | 25 | 22 | 25 |
| Capital Allocation | 5 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| **TOTAL** | **63** | **71** | **79** | **100** |

Note: Financial Quality 40/40 is perfect score. ROIC-WACC spread +42pp, FCF margin 50%, leverage 0.1x, FCF positive 4/4 years. This is among the strongest financial profiles in the portfolio.

## Business Understanding

### What AutoTrader Does

AutoTrader Group operates the UK's leading digital automotive marketplace. The platform connects car buyers with dealers and private sellers. It is essentially the "Rightmove of cars" -- a dominant digital classifieds platform with massive network effects.

**Problem it solves:** Car buyers need a comprehensive, trusted marketplace to search inventory, compare prices, and initiate purchases. Dealers need the most eyeballs to sell their stock quickly.

**This is a "must-have" for dealers:** With 75% of all automotive classified minutes on AutoTrader, dealers cannot afford not to advertise on the platform. This creates enormous pricing power -- though the April 2026 pricing deceleration (5.5% vs 8% prior year) and the dealer revolt suggest this power has REAL limits.

### Revenue Model

| Segment | % Revenue | Model | Growth Driver |
|---------|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Retailer** | ~80% | Subscription (monthly packages) | ARPR pricing + new products |
| **Consumer Services** | ~10% | Transaction/ads | Part-exchange, finance referrals |
| **Manufacturer/Agency** | ~10% | Display advertising | New car launches, branding |

**Revenue characteristics:**
- ~90% recurring/subscription-based (dealer packages)
- ARPR (Average Revenue Per Retailer) = GBP 2,994/month (H1 2026, +5% YoY)
- ~14,080 retailer forecourts on platform (H1 2026, +1% YoY)
- Annual price increases implemented each April -- FY27 increase: 5.5% (vs 8% prior year)

### Unit Economics

```
ARPR: GBP 2,994/month = GBP 35,928/year
Number of Retailer Forecourts: ~14,080
Retailer Revenue: ~GBP 480M (FY2025)

Customer Acquisition Cost: Near zero (network effects)
Churn: Low but RISING (59 cancellations, 180+ downgrades from Deal Builder)
LTV/CAC: Still high for core dealer base, but direction of change is NEGATIVE

Platform Metrics:
- ~982M visits in 2025 (nearly 1 billion)
- 86.3M visits in January 2026 (+24.7% MoM, strong engagement)
- 75%+ of all automotive classified minutes
```

### Margin Structure

```
Gross Margin:     ~72-84% (varies by year; vs ~50% sector = +22-34pp premium)
Operating Margin: ~62% (H1 2026)
Net Margin:       ~47-48%
FCF Margin:       ~50%

Trend 5 years: STABLE to slightly EXPANDING
```

## Por Que Esta Barata (Updated Feb 11 -- Urgent Re-Eval)

### Price History

- 52-week high: 920p (May 2025)
- Current price: 470p (Feb 11)
- 52-week low: 468.6p (Feb 10, 2026) -- NEW LOW
- Decline: -49% from high, -3.3% since our entry at 485.80p

### Narrativa del Mercado (UPDATED)

1. **Deal Builder revolt INTENSIFYING** -- Not 59 cancellations and done. 180+ dealers downgraded subscriptions. 3,300+ dealers in protest Facebook group. Jefferies downgraded to HOLD (895p to 650p), Berenberg cut target 830p to 665p. JPMorgan maintains UNDERWEIGHT. CEO Coe denied Deal Builder is responsible for stock decline, blamed "AI uncertainty" -- this deflection is concerning because it suggests management is not acknowledging the core problem.

2. **ARPR growth deceleration is the REAL signal** -- April 2026 pricing event at only 5.5% (vs 8% last year). Berenberg cut FY27 ARPR growth from 7.5% to 5.2%. This is not temporary noise -- it represents a structural moderation of pricing power. The question is whether 5% is the new normal or whether further erosion occurs.

3. **AI/tech disintermediation anxiety** -- All UK classifieds (AUTO, RMV, MONY) lost ~40% in 6 months. Sector-wide derating. Facebook Marketplace Pro launched AI tools for car dealers (Feb 2026).

4. **UK car market** -- Actually POSITIVE: 2025 used car sales +2.2%, 2026 forecast +3%. Platform visits at record 86.3M in January. Consumer engagement is NOT the problem.

5. **Rightmove GBP 1B class action precedent** -- Risk assessment identifies this as HIGH risk. AutoTrader's business model is structurally identical to Rightmove's. If Rightmove loses, AutoTrader faces similar litigation risk.

### Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | SI/NO | Detail |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Industria en declive secular | NO | UK car market growing |
| Disrupcion tecnologica | MAYBE | AI search is slow-burning threat |
| Management destruyendo valor | NO | Active buybacks at depressed prices |
| Balance deteriorandose | NO | Net cash position |
| Insider selling masivo | NO | No evidence |
| Dividend cut probable | NO | Payout 32%, well covered |
| Perdida market share >2pp | NO | Still 75%+ minutes |
| ROIC < WACC | NO | ROIC-WACC spread +42pp |
| FCF negativo >2 anos | NO | FCF GBP 301M, 50% margin |
| Goodwill >50% equity | POSSIBLE | Legacy, immaterial for asset-light |

**TOTAL: 0-1/10** -- Very low value trap risk on CURRENT metrics. But the moat siege is a LEADING indicator -- the numbers above are backward-looking.

## Moat Assessment: UPDATED (Urgent Re-Eval Feb 11)

### Moat Status: NARROW AND UNDER ACTIVE SIEGE

The adversarial review (Feb 11) scored moat 14/25 (Narrow). The developments since confirm this is the correct framing:

**Evidence of moat durability (positive):**
- 75%+ market share in classified minutes unchanged
- 86.3M visits in January 2026 (+24.7% MoM) -- consumer engagement at record
- No credible competitor >5% market share (Motors.co.uk still tiny)
- Network effects are real: dealers CANNOT reach this audience elsewhere

**Evidence of moat erosion (negative):**
- 180+ dealers downgraded subscriptions -- this is the LARGEST dealer revolt in company history
- April pricing decelerated from 8% to 5.5% -- pricing power is being constrained
- Only 4,000/14,080 dealers (29%) adopted Deal Builder -- the "tent pole" product is struggling
- CEO forced to publicly apologize on Car Dealer Podcast
- Dealers directing CMA complaints with "specialist lawyers"
- Rightmove GBP 1B class action creates legal blueprint for monopoly platforms
- Facebook Marketplace Pro launched AI tools for car dealers (Feb 2026)

**Adversarial risk assessment scoring this as THE critical risk:**
All 5 HIGH+ risks (Deal Builder, CMA, ARPR deceleration, Rightmove precedent, multiple compression) emanate from the SAME source: dealer relationship deterioration. This is a single-point-of-failure risk cluster.

### Does the dealer revolt CHANGE the moat assessment?

**My assessment: The moat is NOT breached, but it is WEAKER than at time of purchase.**

The monopoly over classified minutes is intact -- dealers are DOWNGRADING packages, not leaving the platform for a competitor. There is no alternative that achieves even 10% of AutoTrader's reach. However:

1. Pricing power is demonstrably constrained (8% to 5.5%)
2. The direction of travel is negative (downgrades, not upgrades)
3. The CMA/legal overhang creates a ceiling on future price increases
4. Facebook Marketplace is a viable (if inferior) free alternative that did not exist at scale 2 years ago

This shifts the valuation downward because growth depends primarily on ARPR pricing (80% of revenue), and pricing power is the mechanism through which the moat translates to shareholder value.

---

## Valuation (Re-Evaluation, Feb 11)

### Revision from Adversarial FV

The adversarial review (earlier today) set FV at 617p with 6% growth assumption. Given the INTENSIFYING nature of the dealer revolt (180+ downgrades, not just 59 cancellations), I am adjusting the probability weights:

### Method 1 (Primary, 60%): Owner Earnings Yield

```
FCF (TTM): GBP 301M
Owner Earnings: ~GBP 299M
Market Cap at 470p: ~GBP 3.94B
OEY: 7.6%

Revised growth assumption: 5% (down from 6% adversarial)
  Reasoning:
  - ARPR pricing limited to 5.5% in April (management already conceded)
  - Berenberg projects only 5.2% ARPR growth for FY27
  - Dealer count growth only +1% and may go negative if revolt continues
  - Buyback adds ~1-2% to EPS growth but revenue growth may be only 4-5%
  - 5% total growth = 4% organic + 1% buyback accretion

OEY + Growth = 7.6% + 5% = 12.6%
WACC = 8.6% (tool-derived)
Spread = 4.0pp (positive but narrowing)

Implied FV from OEY at 5% growth: ~590-610p
```

### Method 2 (Secondary, 40%): EV/EBIT Peers

```
Operating Profit (TTM): ~GBP 373M
Applying 12-13x EV/EBIT (discount to Rightmove due to Deal Builder + CMA risk):
  At 12x: EV = 4.48B, FV/share = ~530p
  At 13x: EV = 4.85B, FV/share = ~574p
  Midpoint: 552p
```

### Reconciliation

| Method | FV (Adversarial) | FV (Re-Eval Feb 11) | Delta |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|-------|
| OEY (60%) | 630p | 600p | -4.8% |
| EV/EBIT Peers (40%) | 597p | 552p | -7.5% |
| **Weighted Average** | **617p** | **580p** | **-6.0%** |

### DCF Cross-Check (from tool)

| Scenario | Growth | WACC | FV |
|----------|--------|------|-----|
| Bear | Default (-2pp growth) | +1pp | 496p |
| Base | 5% | 9% | 625p |
| Bull | +2pp growth | -1pp | 808p |

Sensitivity shows that at 3.5% growth and 9% WACC, FV = 586p. This triangulates well with my revised 580p.

### Scenario Table (REVISED -- Probability Shift)

| Scenario | Prob | FV | MoS at 470p |
|----------|------|----|-------------|
| Bear (3% growth, pricing power severely hit, CMA risk) | **30%** (was 25%) | 480p | 2.1% |
| Base (5% growth, moderate ongoing friction) | **50%** | 580p | 19.0% |
| Bull (7%+ growth, Deal Builder resolves, rerates) | **20%** (was 25%) | 720p | 34.7% |
| **Expected Value** | 100% | **574p** | **18.1%** |

**Re-Eval FV: 580p | Price: 470p | MoS: 19.0%**

Compared to adversarial (earlier today): FV 617p to 580p (-6%), MoS 23.7% to 19.0%.

The shift is driven by:
1. Raising bear probability from 25% to 30% (dealer revolt intensifying, not subsiding)
2. Lowering bull probability from 25% to 20% (multiple analyst downgrades reduce rerating probability)
3. Cutting base growth from 6% to 5% (Berenberg 5.2% FY27 + deceleration trend)

## Kill Conditions (UPDATED)

| # | Kill Condition | Status | Notes |
|---|----------------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Dealer count decline >5% in a year | **OK** | Up 1% in H1 2026. But monitor April-June closely. |
| 2 | ARPR growth turns negative | **OK** | +5% H1 2026. Decelerating but positive. |
| 3 | Competitor >20% market share | **OK** | Motors.co.uk ~5% at best. |
| 4 | FCF margin <35% | **OK** | 50%. Rock solid. |
| 5 | Large M&A >GBP 1B | **OK** | None. |
| 6 | OEM direct >20% UK sales | **OK** | Still <5%. |
| 7 | AI buying agents disintermediate search | **OK** | Nascent, 3-5yr. |
| 8 | **NEW: CMA opens formal investigation** | **OK -- MONITOR** | Dealers filing complaints. No investigation yet. |
| 9 | **NEW: ARPR growth below 2% for 2 consecutive periods** | **OK** | Currently 5%. But watch FY27 reporting. |

**No kill conditions triggered. KC#8 (CMA) requires active monitoring.**

---

## EXIT Protocol Application (6 Gates)

**Gate 1: Kill Condition?** NO -- all 9 kill conditions OK (including 2 new ones).

**Gate 2: Thesis Valid?** WEAKENED but not invalidated. The core monopoly thesis (75% market share, 50% FCF margin, ROIC +42pp) is intact. But the GROWTH thesis is weaker: pricing power is demonstrably constrained (8% to 5.5%). Deal Builder was meant to be the next growth engine and has only 29% adoption. Dealer sentiment is at its worst in company history. Overall: thesis intacta for business quality, DEBILITADA for growth trajectory.

**Gate 3: MoS Current?** 19.0% at revised FV of 580p. For a Tier B position with active moat siege, this is MARGINAL. Precedent: decisions_log shows Tier B typically needs 20-25% MoS. We are at the low end. Not a sell signal by itself, but no room for further deterioration.

**Gate 4: Opportunity Score?** No specific Tier A candidate in pipeline that needs this capital RIGHT NOW. Cash at 44% is the alternative. The question is: 19% MoS with moat-siege risk vs 4.5pp annual cash drag. On balance, 19% MoS + 5% growth + 2.3% yield = ~26% total expected return over 2-3 years vs ~0% from cash. Still better to hold unless a clear Tier A opportunity emerges.

**Gate 5: Dead Money?** TOO EARLY -- position held only 5 days. Key catalysts: April 2026 pricing event (7 weeks), May 2026 FY results. If price is still at 470p after May results, reassess.

**Gate 6: Friction?** Minimal. Liquid stock, small loss (-3.3%), no meaningful tax impact.

---

## Verdict: HOLD -- LOW Conviction

### Reasoning (from principles)

**Principio 6 (Vender Requiere Argumento):**
Vender requires an explicit argument. The arguments for selling:
- MoS marginal at 19% for Tier B with moat under siege
- Pricing power demonstrably constrained
- Dealer revolt intensifying (180+ downgrades)
- Stock at 52-week low with negative momentum

The arguments AGAINST selling:
- Financial quality remains exceptional: 40/40 on tool, ROIC +42pp, FCF 50%
- Monopoly position INTACT -- dealers are downgrading, not leaving for competitors
- Value trap score 0-1/10 -- this is NOT a value trap by any traditional measure
- No kill conditions triggered
- Expected value 574p still 22% above current price
- April pricing event is only 7 weeks away -- key data point
- Management buying back shares aggressively (700K at 475p on Feb 10, 430K at 536p earlier)
- Position small at 3.4%, loss manageable
- 44% cash means we do not need to sell to fund other opportunities

The balance of arguments favors HOLD, but conviction is LOW (downgraded from MEDIUM) because:
1. MoS narrowing from 24% to 19%
2. Bear probability raised to 30%
3. Moat siege is intensifying, not resolving
4. CEO's denial that Deal Builder caused the stock decline is a yellow flag for management transparency

**Principio 7 (Consistencia por Razonamiento):**
Precedents consulted:
- BYIT.L adversarial review (same session): QS 81 to 68-72, moat under siege from Microsoft restructuring. Decision: HOLD ON PROBATION with similar MoS (~14%). AUTO.L has higher MoS (19%) and stronger financial quality. Consistent with HOLD.
- MONY.L adversarial review: QS 81 to 65-70, similar UK digital platform, conviction LOW. Decision: HOLD through earnings. AUTO.L is consistent.
- HRB adversarial: FCF declining structurally, moat breached by Intuit. Decision: SELL. AUTO.L is DIFFERENT because: (a) FCF is GROWING not declining, (b) no competitor has achieved meaningful share, (c) financial quality 40/40 vs HRB's deteriorating FCF.

The precedent that best matches AUTO.L is BYIT.L/MONY.L (UK digital platform with moat under siege, hold pending key catalyst). This supports HOLD.

**Principio 9 (Quality Gravitates Upward):**
AUTO.L at QS 71 is Tier B. The portfolio gravitates toward Tier A. Does AUTO.L earn its place? The argument is:
- Financial Quality 40/40 is best-in-class (better than most Tier A positions)
- The QS is dragged down by growth scoring data gaps and moat uncertainty
- If April pricing event goes well, QS could stabilize or improve
- If it goes poorly, this position becomes an exit candidate for capital rotation

AUTO.L earns a CONDITIONAL place in the portfolio -- conditional on the April pricing event.

### What Changes Conviction

**UPWARD to MEDIUM (reinstate):**
- April 2026 pricing event accepted with fewer than 50 additional cancellations
- ARPR growth confirmed at 5%+ for FY2026 full year
- Dealer count stable or growing in FY2026 reporting

**DOWNWARD to EXIT:**
- April pricing causes >200 additional cancellations or >3% dealer count decline
- CMA opens formal investigation
- ARPR growth falls below 3% in any reporting period
- Competitor achieves >10% of classified minutes

---

## META-REFLECTION

### Changes Detected Since Last Review (Adversarial, earlier today)

- Price has touched NEW 52-week low of 468.6p (Feb 10)
- Dealer revolt details refined: 180+ downgrades (not just 59 cancellations)
- Multiple analyst downgrades confirmed (Jefferies HOLD 650p, Berenberg HOLD 665p, JPMorgan UNDERWEIGHT)
- CEO deflection on Deal Builder ("AI uncertainty" not Deal Builder caused share price decline) is a yellow flag
- Share buyback intensifying: 700K shares at 475p on Feb 10

### Incertidumbres

- April 2026 pricing event outcome is genuinely unknowable -- it is the KEY binary catalyst
- Whether the 180+ downgrades are permanent revenue loss or temporary protest (dealers may quietly upgrade after April)
- CMA complaint status -- dealers claim to be filing but no formal investigation exists
- Facebook Marketplace UK penetration for used car classified minutes -- unmeasurable
- Whether 5.5% pricing is a one-time concession or the start of a structural decline in pricing power

### Sugerencias

- Create calendar alert for May 2026: AUTO.L FY2026 results = MANDATORY REVIEW
- Track dealer count at each reporting period as leading indicator for moat health
- Monitor Rightmove class action developments as leading indicator for AUTO.L legal risk
- Create "UK digital platforms" sector view (AUTO.L, MONY.L, RMV.L) -- these are correlated

### Alertas para Orchestrator

- Conviction downgraded from MEDIUM to LOW
- FV revised down again: 617p to 580p
- MoS now at 19% -- marginal for Tier B with moat siege
- April 2026 pricing event is MAKE-OR-BREAK catalyst
- If any Tier A opportunity in pipeline needs capital, AUTO.L is a candidate for rotation
