## TL;DR

AutoTrader Group is the dominant online car classifieds platform in the UK with 75%+ of all automotive classified minutes and 10x larger than its nearest competitor. **Adversarial-adjusted QS 71/100 (Tier B, high-end)** -- downgraded from original 79 (Tier A) due to EPS data gaps and tool bias in moat scoring. Exceptional financials remain intact: 50% FCF margin, near-zero debt, +42pp ROIC spread, and 62% operating margin. Stock at 471p, down 49% from 52w high. Deal Builder pricing event deceleration (8% to 5.5%) is new evidence of constrained pricing power. **Adversarial FV 617p, MoS 23.7%.** HOLD with Medium conviction pending April 2026 pricing event and May 2026 FY results.

## Quality Score

### QS Tool: 63/100 (Tier B) -- data gaps in GM and EPS for 2025
### QS Adjusted: 71/100 (Tier B, high-end)

**Adjustment reasoning (+8 points):**
- GM Premium: +10 pts (tool scores 0 due to nan in 2025; actual GM 72-84% vs 50% sector = +22-34pp premium)
- Market Position: +8 pts (tool scores 0 default; actual #1 UK auto classifieds by 10x margin, 75%+ market share)
- Offset: EPS CAGR unverifiable (nan in 2025), scored 0 by tool -- partially valid, cannot inflate

**Original thesis claimed 79 (Tier A). Adversarial adjustment: -8 points. Key differences:**
- Growth Quality: thesis claimed 13/25, tool gives 11/25, adversarial gives 8-11/25 (EPS unverifiable)
- Moat scoring: thesis manually overrode tool market_position from 5 to 8 -- justified by evidence but aggressive

### Quality Score Breakdown (Adversarial-Adjusted)

| Category | Tool | Adjusted | Thesis (original) | Max |
|----------|------|----------|-------------------|-----|
| Financial Quality | 40 | 40 | 39 | 40 |
| Growth Quality | 11 | 11 | 13 | 25 |
| Moat Evidence | 7 | 25 | 22 | 25 |
| Capital Allocation | 5 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| **TOTAL** | **63** | **71** | **79** | **100** |

Note: Financial Quality 40/40 is perfect score. ROIC-WACC spread +42pp, FCF margin 50%, leverage 0.1x, FCF positive 4/4 years. This is among the strongest financial profiles in the portfolio.

## Business Understanding

### What AutoTrader Does

AutoTrader Group operates the UK's leading digital automotive marketplace. The platform connects car buyers with dealers and private sellers. It is essentially the "Rightmove of cars" - a dominant digital classifieds platform with massive network effects.

**Problem it solves:** Car buyers need a comprehensive, trusted marketplace to search inventory, compare prices, and initiate purchases. Dealers need the most eyeballs to sell their stock quickly.

**This is a "must-have" for dealers:** With 75% of all automotive classified minutes on AutoTrader, dealers cannot afford not to advertise on the platform. This creates enormous pricing power -- though the April 2026 pricing deceleration (5.5% vs 8% prior year) suggests this power has limits.

### Revenue Model

| Segment | % Revenue | Model | Growth Driver |
|---------|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Retailer** | ~80% | Subscription (monthly packages) | ARPR pricing + new products |
| **Consumer Services** | ~10% | Transaction/ads | Part-exchange, finance referrals |
| **Manufacturer/Agency** | ~10% | Display advertising | New car launches, branding |

**Revenue characteristics:**
- ~90% recurring/subscription-based (dealer packages)
- ARPR (Average Revenue Per Retailer) = GBP 2,994/month (H1 2026, +5% YoY)
- ~14,080 retailer forecourts on platform (H1 2026, +1% YoY)
- Annual price increases implemented each April -- FY27 increase: 5.5% (vs 8% prior year)

### Unit Economics

```
ARPR: GBP 2,994/month = GBP 35,928/year
Number of Retailer Forecourts: ~14,080
Retailer Revenue: ~GBP 480M (FY2025)

Customer Acquisition Cost: Near zero (network effects)
Churn: Very low (59 cancellations from Deal Builder = 0.4%)
LTV/CAC: Effectively infinite for core dealer base

Platform Metrics:
- ~982M visits in 2025 (nearly 1 billion)
- 86.3M visits in January 2026 (strong engagement)
- 75%+ of all automotive classified minutes
```

### Margin Structure

```
Gross Margin:     ~72-84% (varies by year; vs ~50% sector = +22-34pp premium)
Operating Margin: ~62% (H1 2026)
Net Margin:       ~47-48%
FCF Margin:       ~50%

Trend 5 years: STABLE to slightly EXPANDING

## Por Que Esta Barata (Updated Feb 11)

### Price History

- 52-week high: 920p (May 2025)
- Current price: 471p
- 52-week low: 468.6p (touched Feb 2026)
- Decline: -49% from high

### Narrativa del Mercado

1. **Deal Builder backlash** -- 59 dealers cancelled, 70+ downgraded, 180+ reduced spend. April 2026 pricing decelerated from 8% to 5.5%. Jefferies downgraded to HOLD (650p target), Berenberg cut target to 665p.

2. **ARPR growth deceleration risk** -- Berenberg cut FY27 ARPR growth forecast from 7.5% to 5.2%. If pricing power is structurally constrained, the growth story weakens.

3. **AI/tech disintermediation anxiety** -- All UK classifieds (AUTO, RMV, MONY) lost ~40% in 6 months. Sector-wide derating.

4. **UK car market** -- Actually POSITIVE: 2025 used car sales +2.2%, 2026 forecast +3%. Platform visits at record levels.

### Value Trap Checklist

|--------|-------|--------|
| Industria en declive secular | NO | UK car market growing |

| ROIC < WACC | NO | ROIC-WACC spread +42pp |
| FCF negativo >2 anos | NO | FCF GBP 301M, 50% margin |
| Goodwill >50% equity | POSSIBLE | Legacy, immaterial for asset-light |

**TOTAL: 0-1/10** -- Very low value trap risk.

## Valuation (Adversarial-Revised, Feb 11)

### Method 1 (Primary, 60%): Owner Earnings Yield

```
FCF (TTM): GBP 301M
Owner Earnings: ~GBP 299M
Market Cap at 471p: ~GBP 3.95B
OEY: 7.6%

Adversarial growth assumption: 6% (5% organic + buyback)
  - Down from thesis 8% based on:
  - ARPR pricing deceleration (8% -> 5.5%)
  - Berenberg FY27 ARPR growth cut (7.5% -> 5.2%)
  - Dealer count growth modest (+1%)

OEY + Growth = 7.6% + 6% = 13.6%
WACC = 8.6% (tool-derived)
Spread = 5.0pp (positive, still attractive)

Implied FV: ~630p
```

### Method 2 (Secondary, 40%): EV/EBIT Peers

```
Operating Profit (TTM): ~GBP 373M
Applying 13-14x EV/EBIT (discount to Rightmove due to Deal Builder uncertainty):
  FV range: 574-620p, midpoint 597p
```

### Reconciliation

| Method | FV (Original) | FV (Adversarial) | Delta |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| OEY (60%) | 720p | 630p | -12.5% |
| EV/EBIT Peers (40%) | 640p | 597p | -6.7% |
| **Weighted Average** | **688p** | **617p** | **-10.3%** |

| 5% | 8.5% | 532p | 679p | 891p |
| 7% | 8.5% | 580p | 739p | 971p |

### Scenarios (Revised)

| Scenario | Prob | FV | MoS at 471p |
|----------|------|----|-------------|
| Bear (3% growth, pricing hit) | 25% | 490p | 3.9% |
| Base (6% growth, moderate impact) | 50% | 617p | 23.7% |
| Bull (7%+ growth, Deal Builder resolves) | 25% | 740p | 36.4% |
| **Expected Value** | 100% | **616p** | **23.5%** |

**Adversarial FV: 617p | Price: 471p | MoS: 23.7%**

## Adversarial Review Summary (Feb 11)

Full adversarial review: `thesis/research/AUTO.L/adversarial_thesis_review.md`

**Key findings:**
1. QS inflated: 79 (Tier A) -> 71 (Tier B) -- mainly growth scoring gap
2. FV revised: 688p -> 617p (-10.3%) -- smallest delta among all adversarial reviews
3. Growth assumption cut: 8% -> 6% (ARPR pricing deceleration)
4. Financial quality remains exceptional: 40/40
5. Monopoly position intact near-term, but pricing power has limits
6. No kill conditions triggered
7. **HOLD at medium conviction** -- wait for April pricing event and May FY results

**What would change conviction:**
- UPWARD: April 2026 pricing event accepted smoothly by dealers, ARPR >5% in H2
- DOWNWARD: ARPR growth <4%, dealer count declines, competitor gains share

## META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres

- April 2026 pricing event is the KEY near-term catalyst
- ARPR growth trajectory FY27+ genuinely uncertain
- Facebook Marketplace UK car market share unmeasurable
- AI disintermediation timeline hard to forecast

### Sugerencias de Mejora

- Create "UK digital platforms" sector view (AUTO.L, MONY.L, RMV.L)
- Track ARPR growth at each reporting date as leading indicator
- Fix quality_scorer.py nan handling for gross margin

### Alertas para Orchestrator

- ADD standing order CANCELLED (was based on inflated FV)
- UK concentration: 4th UK position in portfolio
- Tier downgrade from A to B -- future decisions use Tier B framework
