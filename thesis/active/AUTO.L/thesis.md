## TL;DR

AutoTrader Group is the dominant online car classifieds platform in the UK with 75%+ of all automotive classified minutes and 10x larger than its nearest competitor. Quality Score 79/100 (Tier A) driven by exceptional financials: 50% FCF margin, near-zero debt, 38% ROIC spread, and 62% operating margin. The stock has fallen 47% from its 52-week high of 920p to 486p, driven by dealer backlash over the mandatory Deal Builder rollout and multiple compression from a P/E of ~28x to ~15x. The business fundamentals remain intact: revenue growing 5-7%, ARPR rising 5% annually, and the UK car market recovering toward pre-pandemic levels. At current prices, Owner Earnings Yield + Growth provides an attractive spread vs WACC. **BUY with MoS 28-40% depending on scenario.**

## Quality Score: 79/100 - TIER A

### Quality Score Breakdown

### Detalle por Componente

**Financial Quality (39/40):**
- ROIC Spread: ~38% ROIC vs ~8-9% WACC = +29-30pp spread (15 pts)
- FCF Margin: 50% = exceptional, among the best of any listed company (10 pts)
- Leverage: 0.1x Net Debt/EBITDA = essentially net cash (10 pts)
- FCF Consistency: 4/5 years positive (4 pts) - one year anomaly likely COVID-related

**Growth Quality (13/25):**
- Revenue CAGR 5yr: ~7% (5 pts) - moderate but consistent
- EPS CAGR 5yr: ~8% (5 pts) - enhanced by buybacks
- Gross Margin Trend: Stable (3 pts)

**Moat Evidence (22/25):**
- Gross Margin Premium: ~79% GM vs ~50% Communication Services median = +29pp (10 pts)
- Market Position: #1 in UK auto classifieds, undisputed (tool scored 5 pts conservatively; I assess 8 pts as #1 by huge margin - 10x nearest competitor)
- ROIC Persistence: ROIC has been well above WACC for 10+ years since IPO (7 pts)

**Capital Allocation (5/10):**
- Shareholder Returns: 10+ years of dividends + ongoing buyback program (5 pts)
- Insider Ownership: ~0.5% - low institutional/management ownership (0 pts)

**Comparison with MONY.L (QS 81, also UK platform):**
- AUTO.L has higher FCF margin (50% vs 23%) and wider ROIC spread
- MONY.L has better insider ownership (10.5% vs 0.5%) and stronger capital allocation
- Both are UK-dominant platform businesses with pricing power
- AUTO.L's moat is arguably stronger: 75%+ market share vs MONY's #2 position

## Business Understanding

### What AutoTrader Does

AutoTrader Group operates the UK's leading digital automotive marketplace. The platform connects car buyers with dealers and private sellers. It is essentially the "Rightmove of cars" - a dominant digital classifieds platform with massive network effects.

**Problem it solves:** Car buyers need a comprehensive, trusted marketplace to search inventory, compare prices, and initiate purchases. Dealers need the most eyeballs to sell their stock quickly.

**This is a "must-have" for dealers:** With 75% of all automotive classified minutes on AutoTrader, dealers cannot afford not to advertise on the platform. This creates enormous pricing power.

### Revenue Model

| Segment | % Revenue | Model | Growth Driver |
|---------|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Retailer** | ~80% | Subscription (monthly packages) | ARPR pricing + new products |
| **Consumer Services** | ~10% | Transaction/ads | Part-exchange, finance referrals |
| **Manufacturer/Agency** | ~10% | Display advertising | New car launches, branding |

**Revenue characteristics:**
- ~90% recurring/subscription-based (dealer packages)
- ARPR (Average Revenue Per Retailer) = GBP 2,994/month (H1 2026)
- ~13,500 retailer forecourts on platform
- Annual price increases implemented each April

### Unit Economics

```
ARPR (Average Revenue Per Retailer): GBP 2,994/month = GBP 35,928/year
Number of Retailer Forecourts: ~13,500
Retailer Revenue: ~GBP 480M (FY2025)

Customer Acquisition Cost: Near zero (dealers come to AutoTrader because buyers are there)
Churn: Very low (dealers cannot afford to leave the dominant platform)
LTV/CAC: Effectively infinite for core dealer base

Platform Metrics:
- ~982M visits in 2025 (nearly 1 billion)
- 32 site visits per second
- 75%+ of all automotive classified minutes
```

The LTV/CAC ratio is exceptional because the business exhibits classic marketplace network effects: buyers go where the inventory is, dealers go where the buyers are. AutoTrader won this chicken-and-egg problem decisively years ago.

### Margin Structure

```
Gross Margin:     ~79% (vs ~50% sector median = +29pp premium)
Operating Margin: ~62-63% (core Auto Trader business: 70%)
Net Margin:       ~47-48%
FCF Margin:       ~50%

Trend 5 years: STABLE to slightly EXPANDING
```

This margin profile is extraordinary. Only a handful of listed companies globally achieve 50%+ FCF margins. The business model is almost pure software/marketplace with minimal COGS.

### Capital Requirements

| Type | Capex % Rev | Working Capital | Category |
|------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| Ultra-light | ~2.5% (GBP 15M on GBP 600M rev) | Negative WC (cash generative) | Asset-light |

- Maintenance capex is minimal (servers, platform maintenance)
- Growth capex is also minimal (product development, AI features)
- Working capital is negative: AutoTrader collects from dealers before needing to pay suppliers
- FCF conversion from net income is very high (~100%)

## Por Que Esta Barata

### Price History

- 52-week high: 920p (May 2025)
- Current price: 486p
- Decline: -47% from high, -16% from 52w low of 473p (close to trough)

### Narrativa del Mercado

The market believes:

1. **[X] Deal Builder backlash threatens ARPR growth** - AutoTrader mandated adoption of Deal Builder (online transaction tool) in November 2025, causing dealer revolt. 165 dealers cancelled contracts, 70% of surveyed dealers reduced/downgraded packages.

2. **[X] Pricing power exhaustion** - After years of above-inflation price increases, dealers are pushing back. ARPR grew 5% in H1 2026 but the narrative is this growth rate will decelerate as dealers refuse to pay more.

3. **[X] Multiple compression was overdue** - Stock traded at P/E ~28x at 920p, which was expensive for a 5-7% grower. The derating to ~15x is a normalization, not an anomaly.

4. **[ ] UK car market weakness** - Some concern about macro, but the used car market actually grew 2% in 2025 and is forecast at +3% for 2026.

### Mi Contra-Tesis

**Mercado cree: Deal Builder will cause mass dealer defections**
**Yo creo:** Dealer backlash is cyclical, not structural. AutoTrader is 10x larger than any competitor. Where would dealers go? The same pattern happens with Rightmove in property - agents complain about pricing every year, threaten boycotts, then stay because they need the platform. The 165 cancellations out of ~13,500 forecourts is ~1.2% - noise, not signal.
**Mi evidencia:** ARPR still grew 5% in H1 2026 DESPITE the controversy. Revenue grew 5%. Operating profit grew 6%. The financial results contradict the bear narrative.
**Prob I'm wrong:** 15% - Risk that dealer revolt accelerates materially

**Mercado cree: Pricing power is exhausted**
**Yo creo:** AutoTrader adds GBP 90-100/month pricing and GBP 70-80/month product value at each annual event. This is a ~5-6% annual ARPR growth rate. For a monopoly platform that delivers measurable ROI to dealers (speed of sale, buyer traffic), this is sustainable indefinitely. CEO Nathan Coe admitted "we know we are not cheap" but also "the best product isn't always the cheapest" - this is monopoly behavior.
**Mi evidencia:** ARPR has grown every single year since IPO. Dealer count is stable to growing (+1% in H1 2026).
**Prob I'm wrong:** 10% - Only if a viable alternative emerges

**Mercado cree: P/E compression is permanent repricing**
**Yo creo:** The derating from 28x to 15x overshoots on the downside. AutoTrader's structural characteristics (50% FCF margin, monopoly, recurring revenue) deserve a premium multiple vs. FTSE 100 average of ~14x. Rightmove (similar UK property classifieds monopoly) trades at 17x despite similar growth. Scout24 trades at ~16x EV/EBITDA. The current 12x EV/EBITDA for AUTO.L is a discount to all peers.
**Mi evidencia:** Every peer classifieds platform trades at a premium to AUTO.L's current multiple.
**Prob I'm wrong:** 20% - If growth decelerates to <3%

| Goodwill >50% equity | MAYBE | Legacy of past acquisitions, but irrelevant for asset-light platform |

**TOTAL: 0-1/10 factors SI** - Very low value trap risk. This is a genuine quality business on sale.

## META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres

- **Deal Builder resolution timeline is uncertain.** FY2026 results (May 2026) will be the true test.
- **The -47% decline is steeper than pure fundamentals justify.** Deserves humility.
- **Insider ownership at 0.5% is low.** Buybacks partially compensate.
