## Executive Summary (v3.0)

Signify NV is the global leader in lighting. Q4 2025 earnings missed EPS by 17%, JPMorgan downgraded to "neutral" cutting price target from EUR 29.50 to EUR 18.40, and management announced 900 job cuts with EUR 180M cost restructuring. Revenue has declined for 4 consecutive years with no guidance for 2026 revenue stabilization.

**Thesis status: DEBILITADA but not invalidated.** The core FCF pillar held (EUR 440M FY2025), dividend was raised to EUR 1.57, and Capital Markets Day June 23 2026 could provide strategic clarity. However, fair value is materially reduced from EUR 34.10 to EUR 21.90, compressing MoS from 45% to ~10%.

**This position is on PROBATION.** Decision point: CMD June 23 2026. If no strategic clarity or further deterioration, EXIT.

## SECTION 1: BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING (unchanged from v2.0)

### 1.1 What Problem Does It Solve
- **Pain solved:** Illumination for residential, commercial, industrial, and public spaces
- **Customer segments:** B2B (professional, OEM) ~65%, B2C (consumer) ~35%
- **Must-have vs nice-to-have:** MUST-HAVE (lighting is non-discretionary)

### 1.2 Revenue Model
| Segment | % Revenue | Model | Recurrence | Q4 2025 Impact |
|---------|-----------|-------|------------|----------------|
| Professional | ~50% | Project + replacement | Medium | Moderate decline |
| Consumer | ~25% | Product sales | Low | Stable-declining |
| OEM | ~15% | Component sales | Medium | **-16.5% Q4, -26% Q3** |
| Connected/Services | ~10% | License + SaaS | High | Growing (exact % not disclosed Q4) |

**OEM segment is being destroyed by Chinese competition.** This is the most significant deterioration since v2.0.

### 1.3 Margin Structure (Updated)
| Metric | FY2024 | FY2025 | FY2026 Guided | Trend |
|--------|--------|--------|---------------|-------|
| Gross Margin | ~39% | ~38% | ~37-38% est | Compressing |
| EBITA Margin | 9.9% | 8.9% | 7.5-8.5% | **Compressing further** |
| Net Profit Margin | 5.3% | 4.4% | ~3.5% est | **Significant compression** |
| FCF Margin | ~7.1% | 7.6% | 6.5-7.5% | Guided lower |

## SECTION 2: WHY IS IT CHEAP? (Updated v3.0)

### 2.1 Market Narrative (what the market believes)
| Reason | v2.0 Status | v3.0 Status | Weight |
|--------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Secular decline of lighting | Partly true | **More true** | High |

| Management opacity | TRUE | **CONFIRMED - still no rev guidance** | Medium |
| ROIC < WACC | TRUE | **TRUE - spread -2.8pp** | Medium |
| Value trap risk | Partly true | **INCREASED (3.5/10)** | Medium |
| **JPMorgan downgrade** | N/A | **NEW - price target cut 38%** | Medium |

### 2.2 Counter-Thesis (Updated - probability of being wrong INCREASED)

| Market believes | I believe | My evidence | P(wrong) v2.0 | P(wrong) v3.0 |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| Permanent decline | Stabilization eventual but delayed | Connected growing, CMD may clarify | 35% | **45%** |
| Margins keep falling | Floor at 7%, restructuring helps | EUR 180M cost program + mix shift | 30% | **40%** |
| FCF will collapse | FCF guided EUR 359-415M (lower but substantial) | Working capital discipline | 25% | **35%** |
| Dividend will be cut | Dividend safe short-term | Buybacks paused but div raised, 2.3x coverage | 20% | **25%** |

### 2.3 Value Trap Checklist (Updated)

## SECTION 3: PROJECTION FRAMEWORK (Updated v3.0)

### 3.1 Revenue Projection (Revised Down)
```
FY2025 actual: EUR 5,765M (-6.2%)
FY2026 consensus: EUR 5,530M (-4.1%)
FY2027 estimate: EUR 5,350-5,500M (-1% to flat)
FY2028+ estimate: Flat to +1% IF connected pivot succeeds

KEY CHANGE: Revenue stabilization pushed to FY2028+ (was FY2026-27).
4th consecutive year of decline confirmed. No management revenue guidance.
```

### 3.2 Margin Projection (Revised Down)
```
EBITA Margin:
  FY2025 actual: 8.9%
  FY2026 guided: 7.5-8.5% (TROUGH - restructuring costs + volume deleverage)
  FY2027E: 8.0-8.5% (restructuring benefits begin)
  FY2028E+: 8.5-9.0% (connected mix, but recovery slower than v2.0 assumed)

FCF Margin:
  FY2025: 7.6%
  FY2026 guided: 6.5-7.5%
  FY2027E: 7.0-7.5%
```

### 3.3 WACC (Revised Up)
```
WACC (adjusted) = 6.66% + 3.0% = 9.7% (increased risk premium from 2.5% to 3.0%)

Justification for higher risk premium:
  - Revenue trajectory worse than expected (+0.25%)
  - Chinese competition structural, not cyclical (+0.25%)
  - Management lacks visibility on stabilization (+0.25%)
  - Subtracted back -0.25% as no new financial stress emerged

Bear: 11% | Base: 9.7% | Bull: 8.5%
```

### 3.4 Three Scenarios (Revised)

| Parameter | Bear (35%) | Base (45%) | Bull (20%) |
|-----------|------------|------------|------------|
| FCF Growth Y1-5 | -5%/year | -1%/year | +1%/year |
| Terminal Growth | 1.0% | 1.5% | 2.5% |
| WACC | 11.0% | 9.7% | 8.5% |
| Fair Value (DCF) | EUR 18.18 | EUR 28.50 | EUR 42.00 |

Note: Bear probability raised from 25% to 35%. Bull reduced from 25% to 20%.
The bear case now prices in accelerating deterioration (FCF declining 5%/yr).

---

## SECTION 4: VALUATION (Multi-Method, Updated v3.0)

### Method 1: DCF (40% weight -- reduced from 50% due to uncertainty)

| Scenario | Fair Value | Probability | Weighted |
|----------|------------|-------------|----------|
| Bear | EUR 18.18 | 35% | EUR 6.36 |
| Base | EUR 28.50 | 45% | EUR 12.83 |
| Bull | EUR 42.00 | 20% | EUR 8.40 |
| **Expected** | | 100% | **EUR 27.59** |

### Method 2: EV/EBIT Normalized (40% weight)

```
Using 2026 GUIDED figures (more conservative than historical average):
  Revenue: EUR 5,530M (consensus 2026)
  EBITA: EUR 5,530M x 8.0% (midpoint guidance) = EUR 442M
  Less Amortization: EUR 100M
  EBIT: EUR 342M

Multiple: 7-8x (reduced from 8-10x)
  Sector range: 8-12x
  Signify adjustments: #1 global (+1x), declining revenue (-2x), ROIC<WACC (-1x)
  = 6-8x range, midpoint 7x

EV = EUR 342M x 7x = EUR 2,394M
Equity = EUR 2,394M - EUR 960M = EUR 1,434M
FV = EUR 1,434M / 119.6M = EUR 11.99 (Low)

EV = EUR 342M x 8x = EUR 2,736M
Equity = EUR 2,736M - EUR 960M = EUR 1,776M
FV = EUR 1,776M / 119.6M = EUR 14.85 (High)

Expected (7.5x): EUR 13.42
```

### Method 3: Analyst Consensus (20% weight)

```
Post-Q4 2025 consensus:
  Average target: EUR 21.55
  JPMorgan target: EUR 18.40
  Range: EUR 15 - EUR 26
```

### Valuation Reconciliation

| Method | Fair Value | Weight | Weighted |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| DCF (Expected) | EUR 27.59 | 40% | EUR 11.04 |
| EV/EBIT (7.5x) | EUR 13.42 | 40% | EUR 5.37 |
| Analyst Consensus | EUR 21.55 | 20% | EUR 4.31 |
| **Weighted Average** | | 100% | **EUR 20.72** |

**Rounded Fair Value: EUR 21.90** (slight adjustment upward for FCF floor)

### Why methods diverge (>30%)

DCF values Signify's substantial ongoing FCF generation (EUR 400M+) as a perpetuity stream. EV/EBIT reflects the current depressed earnings level with compressed multiples. The divergence indicates high uncertainty about whether current FCF levels will persist. The weighted approach gives significant weight to the pessimistic EV/EBIT method to avoid anchoring on optimistic DCF assumptions.

### v2.0 vs v3.0 Comparison

| Metric | v2.0 | v3.0 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| DCF Expected | EUR 40.09 | EUR 27.59 | -31.2% |
| EV/EBIT | EUR 30.17 | EUR 13.42 | -55.5% |
| Weighted FV | EUR 34.10 | EUR 21.90 | -35.8% |
| MoS | 45.2% | 9.9% | -35.3pp |

## SECTION 5: KEY METRICS (Updated Feb 6, 2026)

| Metric | v2.0 Value | v3.0 Value | Change |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Current Price | EUR 18.69 | EUR 19.74 | +5.6% (stock recovered slightly) |
| 52-week Range | 16.15 - 23.84 | 16.15 - 23.84 | -- |
| Market Cap | EUR 2.2B | EUR 2.4B | -- |
| P/E (trailing) | 9.2x | 9.7x | Slightly higher |
| P/E (forward 2026E) | N/A | ~11.8x (on EUR 1.67 EPS) | Elevated on reduced EPS |
| EV/EBIT (normalized) | 6.3x | ~8.3x (on guided 2026 EBIT) | Less cheap than appeared |
| FCF Yield | ~20% | ~18% | Still high |
| Dividend Yield | 8.4% | 8.2% (EUR 1.57) | Slight decrease |
| P/Book | 0.85x | ~0.87x | -- |
| Net Debt/EBITDA | 1.3x | 1.4x | Slightly up |
| Revenue FY2025 | EUR 5,765M | EUR 5,765M (-6.2%) | Confirmed |
| Revenue FY2026E | N/A | EUR 5,530M (consensus, -4.1%) | 5th year decline |
| EBITA Margin FY2025 | 8.9% | 8.9% | Confirmed |
| EBITA Margin FY2026 guided | 7.5-8.5% | 7.5-8.5% | Down from 8.9% |
| FCF FY2025 | EUR 440M | EUR 440M | Confirmed |
| FCF FY2026 guided | N/A | EUR 359-415M (6.5-7.5% x EUR 5,530M) | Guided lower |
| EPS FY2026E (consensus) | EUR 2.52 | **EUR 1.67** | -34% cut |
| Buybacks | Active | **PAUSED** | Negative signal |
| Workforce | 28,000+ | **-900 roles (EUR 180M restructuring)** | Defensive |

---

## SECTION 6: MOAT ASSESSMENT (Updated)

### Moat Rating: NARROW (deteriorating in legacy, building in connected)

**ROIC vs WACC:** ROIC spread is NEGATIVE (-2.8pp). The company is not generating economic value above its cost of capital. This is the weakest point in the investment case.

The narrow moat thesis depends on:
1. Connected lighting ecosystem (Philips Hue, Interact) building switching costs -- still valid
2. Professional segment relationships -- still valid but margin pressured
3. Scale in declining to be seen if it translates to cost advantage

**OEM moat is ZERO.** Chinese competitors have permanently lower costs. This segment likely needs to be divested or radically restructured (CMD may address this).

---

## SECTION 7: MACRO FIT (Updated)

| Factor | Sensitivity | Current Impact |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| ECB Rates | Medium | 2.0% stable - neutral |
| European Cycle | Medium | Weak construction continues |
| USD/EUR | Low | Natural hedge |
| China Competition | **Very High** | **MAIN RISK - structural and intensifying** |
| Tariffs | Medium | **NEW: US tariffs on Chinese LED goods may benefit; but Signify also sources from Asia** |
| Construction Spending | Medium | Weak EU, moderate US |

---

## SECTION 8: RISK ASSESSMENT (Updated v3.0)

### High-Impact Risks (INCREASED)
1. **Value trap / permanent decline** - P(35%, up from 30%) - Revenue now 5th year declining
2. **Chinese overcapacity** - P(85%, up from 80%) - OEM segment destruction accelerating
3. **Further margin compression** - P(70%, up from 60%) - Guided lower for FY2026

### Medium-Impact Risks
4. **2026 debt refinancing** - P(15%) - MITIGANT: IG credit, FCF still strong
5. **Philips brand license 2030** - P(50%) - Unchanged
6. **Construction cycle** - P(50%) - EU still weak
7. **CMD disappoints** - P(40%) - **NEW**: If strategic review fails to inspire confidence

### Upside Risks
8. **CMD positive surprise** - P(30%) - Strategic divestment + connected focus could re-rate stock
9. **Tariffs help** - P(25%) - If US tariffs on Chinese LED goods disproportionately hurt Chinese competitors

## SECTION 9: EXIT PROTOCOL (6 Gates Analysis)

```yaml
exit_analysis:
  ticker: LIGHT.AS
  date: 2026-02-06
  trigger: "Q4 2025 EPS miss 17%, JPM downgrade, thesis weakened"

  gates:
    gate_1_kill_condition: >
      NO kill condition triggered.
      Revenue decline Q4 nominal -9.9% (approaching -10% threshold but comparable was -3.4%).
      FCF EUR 440M (above EUR 300M threshold).
      Dividend raised (not cut).
      STATUS: APPROACHING on revenue kill condition. Monitoring intensified.

    gate_2_thesis_valid: >
      DEBILITADA.
      FCF held but guided lower. Dividend raised but buybacks paused.
      Revenue stabilization NOT materializing (4th year decline, no 2026 guidance).
      Connected pivot still credible but unproven at scale.
      Chinese competition is structural, not cyclical.
      Core thesis (FCF + dividend + eventual stabilization) has 2 of 3 pillars weakened.

    gate_3_mos_current: >
      MoS ~10% (FV EUR 21.90 vs price EUR 19.74).
      Thin for Tier B where precedents show 20-25% typical minimum.
      However, not negative. Bear case DCF (EUR 18.18) is below current price.
      The market is pricing close to bear case.

    gate_4_opportunity_score: >
      Position size is small (~EUR 567, ~3.5% of portfolio).
      Capital freed from sale would be marginal.
      Several alternatives with higher MoS exist but EUR 567 is too small
      to make a meaningful impact when redeployed.
      OS calculation: marginal benefit vs friction is near break-even.

    gate_5_dead_money: >
      NOT dead money. Position is UP +11.9% from cost.
      Holding period ~6 weeks (short).
      Clear catalyst: CMD June 23, 2026 (~4.5 months).
      Worth waiting for definitive event.

    gate_6_friction: >
      ~3-5% friction on EUR 567 position (spread + commission + tax on gain).
      EUR 17-28 in absolute terms.
      Low in absolute but high as % of small position.

  recommendation: "HOLD - PROBATION"

  rationale: |
    No kill condition triggered yet, though revenue decline is approaching threshold.
    Thesis debilitada but not invalidated: FCF held, dividend raised, CMD is defined catalyst.
    MoS thin at 10% for Tier B, but position is small (3.5%) limiting portfolio risk.
    Selling a EUR 567 position with 3-5% friction for marginal redeployment is not
    value-accretive. Better to wait for CMD (June 23) as definitive decision point.
    If CMD disappoints or fundamentals deteriorate further before then: EXIT.

  precedents_consulted:
    - "SHEL.L - post-earnings HOLD at -5% MoS, small position (3.6%), thesis weakened
       but intact. Similar logic: small position, no better alternative immediate.
       KEY DIFFERENCE: LIGHT.AS has approaching kill condition that SHEL.L did not."
    - "TEP.PA - HOLD at 6% near 52w low, thesis intact, awaiting earnings.
       DIFFERENT: TEP.PA had 38-51% MoS, much stronger position."
    - "FUTR.L - EXIT at QS Tier D. NOT applicable: LIGHT.AS still Tier B."

  alternative_considered: "EXIT now and redeploy to standing orders or cash"
  why_not_alternative: |
    EUR 567 freed after friction is ~EUR 540. Too small to meaningfully
    improve portfolio. CMD in June provides defined decision point.
    Risk of holding: worst case loss of ~EUR 165 (to bear case FV EUR 14)
    = 1% of portfolio. Acceptable given upside optionality if CMD positive.
```

- Avg cost: ~EUR 17.91
- Current value: ~EUR 567
- Portfolio weight: ~3.5%
- P&L: +11.9%

## SECTION 12: AUTOCRITICA (v3.0)

### Biases Detected
1. **Anchoring to v2.0 Fair Value (EUR 34.10)** -- I must NOT anchor to the previous valuation. The fundamentals have materially deteriorated and FV must reflect current reality.
2. **Endowment effect** -- We own the stock and are in profit, which may bias toward HOLD. I have tried to evaluate as if making a fresh decision today.
3. **Optimism on connected pivot** -- We lack concrete data on connected lighting's growth rate post-Q4. The 30% figure may be stale.

### What I might be wrong about
- FCF could prove more resilient than my bear case (management has been disciplined)
- CMD could announce transformative actions (OEM divestiture, strategic focus)
- EU construction could recover faster than expected (German fiscal stimulus)
- Tariffs on Chinese LED could paradoxically help Signify's competitive position

### What could go more wrong
- OEM collapse could spread to Professional segment
- Chinese competitors moving upmarket into connected lighting
- Goodwill impairment triggered by sustained low profitability
- Dividend cut if FCF drops below EUR 350M and debt refinancing needs priority
