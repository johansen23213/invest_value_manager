## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Teleperformance is the world's largest BPO/customer experience company (EUR 10.3B revenue, 500,000+ employees, 100 countries). The stock has collapsed from EUR 400+ (2021) to EUR 54.60 -- an 86% drawdown driven almost entirely by AI disruption fears. The company trades at 6.8x P/E, ~34% FCF yield, and 7.9% dividend yield. The market is pricing in terminal decline.

**VERDICT: CONDITIONAL BUY at EUR 54.60 with 3.5% position (EUR 383)**

The margin of safety is adequate under base-case assumptions, but the AI risk is real and warrants a smaller-than-maximum position size. This is NOT a no-brainer deep value -- it is a calculated bet that AI disruption will be gradual (5-10 years) rather than sudden (2-3 years), and that TEP can adapt.

## 1. WHY IS THIS SO CHEAP? (The Bear Case)

### 1.1 AI Disruption Fear (PRIMARY driver, ~70% of discount)
- Klarna announced its OpenAI chatbot replaced 700 agents (2024) -- triggered sector-wide panic
- GenAI can suppress 30% of inbound calls before reaching human agents
- Analysts estimate some services face "outright automation" risk
- BofA warns 2026 is a "transition year" with potentially softer growth and margins
- Deutsche Bank slashed target from EUR 105 to EUR 70 (Hold)

### 1.2 Repeated Guidance Cuts (SECONDARY, ~20%)
- Q3 2025: Revenue +1.5% LFL, well below historical 5-7% growth
- Full-year 2025 guidance cut to 1-2% growth (from 2-4% initially)
- EBITA margin guidance cut to 14.7-15% (from 15-15.1%)
- Specialized Services down 7% LFL (lost major TLS visa contract)
- Analysts see >3% organic growth for 2026 as "ambitious"

### 1.3 Elevated Debt (TERTIARY, ~10%)
- Net debt EUR 4,482M (June 2025), up from EUR 3,890M (Dec 2024)
- Increased by ZP "Better Together" acquisition (Feb 2025)
- Net Debt/EBITDA ~2.1x -- manageable but limits flexibility
- Debt/Equity 1.45 -- at our maximum threshold

### My Assessment of the Bear Case:
The AI fear is LEGITIMATE but the market reaction is EXCESSIVE. Key reasons:
1. Revenue is still growing (slowly) -- not declining. AI is a headwind, not a cliff.
2. FCF generation of EUR 1B+ annually provides massive buffer to adapt
3. The company is actively integrating AI (not denying the threat)
4. Complex/emotional customer interactions remain human-dependent
5. BPO companies are becoming AI implementation partners, not just targets

## 2. BUSINESS QUALITY ASSESSMENT

### 2.1 Moat Analysis: NARROW (weakening)

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Scale** | STRONG - Largest BPO globally, 500K employees, 100 countries. Clients need global coverage. |
| **Switching costs** | MODERATE - Multi-year contracts, deep integration into client operations, data/IP. But contracts do get rebid. |
| **Client relationships** | MODERATE - 1,400+ clients, no disclosed concentration >10%. Diversified. |
| **Data advantage** | EMERGING - 500K employees generate training data for AI models. LLM training market (20% CAGR) is new revenue opportunity. |
| **AI disruption risk** | HIGH - Core voice/chat services are directly in the crosshairs of LLMs. |

**Moat verdict:** The traditional moat (scale + switching costs) is being eroded by AI. However, TEP's massive scale and data position could become a NEW moat if they successfully pivot to AI-augmented services. This is the core investment thesis.

### 2.2 Revenue Breakdown
- **Core Services (85%):** Customer care, tech support, content moderation. Growing +2.9% LFL in H1 2025.
- **Specialized Services (15%):** LanguageLine (interpretation), TLScontact (visa processing). Declining -7% due to contract losses.

### 2.3 Geographic Diversification
- Americas: 41% | EMEA & APAC: 44% | Specialized: 15%
- Good diversification, though US exposure creates FX risk with EUR reporting.

## 3. FINANCIAL METRICS

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Revenue TTM | EUR 10.3B | Stable, low single-digit growth |
| EBITA Margin | 13.6-15% | Good for BPO, stable |
| Net FCF 2024 | EUR 1,084M | Excellent cash generation |
| P/E | 6.8x (Fwd 3.9x) | Extremely cheap |
| FCF Yield | ~34% (company def) | Genuinely extraordinary |
| Dividend | EUR 4.20 (7.9% yield) | Well covered, 25yr track record |
| Net Debt | EUR 4,482M | 2.1x EBITDA -- acceptable |
| Interest Coverage | ~8.6x | Comfortable |
| Dividend Coverage by FCF | 4.1x | Very safe |
| Payout Ratio | ~48-52% | Sustainable |

### FCF Yield Verification
The 38.8% from yfinance is based on operating cash flow minus capex. The company's own "net free cash flow" metric (EUR 1,084M in 2024) gives ~34% yield. Either way, this is GENUINELY extremely high and NOT a one-time distortion. The company has guided for ~EUR 1B FCF in 2025 and EUR 3B cumulative FCF 2026-2028.

### Dividend Sustainability
- EUR 4.20/share x 58.6M shares = EUR 246M annual cost
- FCF of EUR 1,000M covers it 4.1x -- VERY safe
- 25 years of consecutive dividends, 15 years without a cut
- Even in a severe bear scenario (FCF drops 50%), dividend is covered

## 4. VALUATION

### Method 1: DCF (WACC 10%, Terminal Growth 2%)

I use a higher WACC (10% vs typical 8-9%) to reflect AI uncertainty.

**Bear Case (AI disruption accelerates):**
- FCF declines 5% yr1-2, -3% yr3, flat yr4-5, +1-2% yr6-7
- FCF path: 950, 903, 876, 876, 876, 884, 902
- PV of FCFs: ~EUR 4,400M | Terminal PV: ~EUR 5,600M
- EV: ~EUR 10,000M - Net Debt 4,482 = Equity EUR 5,518M
- **Per share: ~EUR 94** (MoS: +42%)

**Base Case (muddle through):**
- FCF flat yr1, +2% yr2-3, +3% yr4-7
- FCF path: 1000, 1020, 1040, 1071, 1103, 1137, 1159
- PV of FCFs: ~EUR 5,100M | Terminal PV: ~EUR 7,400M
- EV: ~EUR 12,500M - Net Debt 4,482 = Equity EUR 8,018M
- **Per share: ~EUR 137** (MoS: +60%)

**Bull Case (AI becomes tailwind):**
- FCF grows 3-5% through period
- PV of FCFs + Terminal: ~EUR 16,000M
- **Per share: ~EUR 197** (MoS: +72%)

### Method 2: EV/EBITDA Comparables

Current EV = 3,200 + 4,482 = EUR 7,682M
EBITDA ~EUR 2,100M
**Current multiple: 3.7x** (absurdly low for any operating business)

| Multiple | Implied Per Share | Context |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| 5.5x (distressed BPO) | EUR 121 | Floor valuation |
| 7.0x (sector median) | EUR 172 | Normal BPO |
| 9.0x (quality BPO) | EUR 240 | If AI fears fade |

Even at a DISTRESSED 5.5x EV/EBITDA, the stock is worth EUR 121 -- more than double current price.

### Method 3: Dividend Discount Model
- Dividend EUR 4.20, Growth 2%, Cost of Equity 12%
- DDM Value: EUR 42/share
- This is the FLOOR -- assumes zero dividend growth forever at punitive discount rate.

### Weighted Fair Value

| Method | Value | Weight |
|--------|-------|--------|
| DCF Base | EUR 137 | 35% |
| DCF Bear | EUR 94 | 25% |
| EV/EBITDA 7x | EUR 172 | 25% |
| DDM | EUR 42 | 15% |

**Weighted Fair Value: EUR 115/share**
**Margin of Safety at EUR 54.60: 53%**

## 5. RISK MATRIX

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|----------|-----------|
| **AI replaces 30-50% of BPO services in 3-5 years** | MEDIUM (35%) | HIGH | CRITICAL | TEP investing in AI; FCF funds adaptation; even bear DCF shows upside |
| **Continued guidance cuts / negative surprises** | HIGH (60%) | MEDIUM | HIGH | Already priced in at 3.7x EV/EBITDA; limited downside from here |
| **Debt becomes problematic if FCF drops sharply** | LOW (15%) | HIGH | MEDIUM | 2.1x leverage manageable; EUR 1B FCF pays down debt fast |
| **Key client losses accelerate** | MEDIUM (25%) | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | 1,400+ clients, no disclosed concentration; diversified |
| **FX headwinds (strong EUR vs USD)** | MEDIUM (40%) | LOW | LOW | Natural hedge via global operations |
| **Management execution failure on AI pivot** | MEDIUM (30%) | HIGH | HIGH | New "Future Forward" strategy; track record of adaptation (survived 2008, COVID) |

### The Critical Question: Value Trap or Deep Value?

**Comparison with rejected names (WPP, HPQ):**
- WPP/HPQ: Secular decline with no credible pivot path
- TEP: Revenue still GROWING (albeit slowly), massive FCF, and a plausible AI pivot story

**Why TEP is NOT (likely) a value trap:**
1. FCF is EUR 1B+ and GROWING -- value traps have deteriorating cash flows
2. The business is still essential -- companies still need customer service
3. AI disruption timeline is years, not months -- TEP has time to adapt
4. At 3.7x EV/EBITDA, even a declining business has value (asset floor)
5. Management is actively pivoting (not in denial like Kodak)

**Why it COULD be a value trap:**
1. If AI disruption accelerates faster than expected (Klarna scenario at scale)
2. If large clients start insourcing AI-based customer service
3. If debt prevents adequate investment in transformation

## 6. MAJOREL ACQUISITION IMPACT

- Completed Nov 2023 for ~EUR 2B
- Integration on track: EUR 94M synergies achieved in 2024, additional EUR 20-30M targeted for 2025
- Added scale in EMEA/APAC markets
- Increased debt (now being paid down with FCF)
- ZP "Better Together" acquisition (Feb 2025) added further to debt
- Net positive: synergies materializing, geographic diversification enhanced

---

## 7. DECISION

### BUY at EUR 54.60

**Rationale:**
- Weighted fair value EUR 115 provides 53% margin of safety (exceeds 25% threshold)
- Even BEAR case DCF (EUR 94) provides 42% upside
- 7.9% dividend yield provides income while waiting
- FCF yield of 34% is extraordinary for any business still growing
- Dividend covered 4.1x by FCF -- extremely safe
- Debt manageable at 2.1x EBITDA with strong deleveraging trajectory

**Position sizing: 3.5% of portfolio (EUR 383)**
- NOT maximum 7% position -- AI disruption risk warrants caution
- Below sector cap (25% Industrial) -- no sector conflict
- Below geography cap (35% Europe)

**Entry:** Acceptable to buy at current EUR 54.60
**Target price:** EUR 90-115 (18-24 month horizon)
**Stop-loss thesis invalidation:** If FCF drops below EUR 600M or revenue declines >5% organically
**Catalyst:** Q4 2025 / FY2025 results (Feb-Mar 2026) showing stabilization

### Specific Recommendation to Owner:
Buy approximately 7 shares of TEP.PA at ~EUR 54.60 = EUR 382.
This deploys 5.8% of available cash (EUR 6,547), leaving EUR 6,165 for other opportunities.

## 8. AUTOCRITICA

**Assumptions made:**
- AI disruption is gradual (5-10 year transition), not sudden
- TEP's FCF generation sustains above EUR 800M through transition
- Management executes on "Future Forward" AI strategy
- No major client exodus

**Biases detected:**
- Possible anchoring to the EUR 400 historical high (irrelevant)
- Possible "bargain hunting" bias -- cheap does not mean good
- Mitigated by using bear-case DCF and high WACC

**Evidence I could NOT verify:**
- Client concentration (company does not disclose)
- Exact AI adoption rate by TEP's specific clients
- Real competitive position vs Concentrix, TTEC post-AI

**What could make me wrong:**
- A "Klarna moment" where a major client publicly replaces TEP with AI
- FCF declining faster than bear case assumes
- Debt covenants triggered if EBITDA drops sharply
