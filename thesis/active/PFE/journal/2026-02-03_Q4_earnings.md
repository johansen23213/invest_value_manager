## Key Business Updates

### 1. Dividend - NO CUT (Thesis Driver Intact)
- Dividend maintained at $1.72/year ($0.43/quarter)
- 17 consecutive years of increases preserved
- **This is the MOST important outcome for our yield-focused thesis**

### 2. Metsera Acquisition ($10B)
- Obesity drug acquisition to compete with Lilly/Novo
- Late to market but shows strategic pivot
- NOT part of base case thesis - this is option value
- Adds leverage but manageable

### 3. Pipeline Activity
- ~20 key pivotal study starts planned for 2026
- 108 drugs in pipeline (up from 106 Q3)
- Oncology, immunology, vaccines focus
- mRNA platform leveraged from COVID

### 4. Patent Cliff Still Looming
- Eliquis ($6-7B revenue) loses exclusivity 2028
- This is KNOWN and guidance reflects it
- Ex-COVID growth +9% shows core replacement working

## Framework v2.0 Assessment Update

### Thesis Scorecard Post-Earnings

| Thesis Element | Pre-Earnings | Post-Earnings | Change |
|----------------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| EPS Guidance | $2.80-3.00 | $2.80-3.00 CONFIRMED | No change |
| Dividend Safety | Safe | **CONFIRMED SAFE** | Positive |
| Ex-COVID Growth | +5-6% expected | +9% actual | **Better** |
| Pipeline Progress | On track | 20 pivotal studies | On track |
| Management Execution | Neutral | **Positive beat** | Improved |

### Fair Value Impact

**Original v2.0 Fair Value: $27.52**

The beat is positive but does NOT materially change fair value because:
1. EPS guidance range unchanged ($2.80-3.00 midpoint $2.90)
2. DDM model already used $2.90 normalized earnings
3. Revenue beat from Prevnar 20 timing, not structural change
4. Obesity acquisition adds optionality, not certain value

**Updated Fair Value Assessment:**

| Method | Pre-Earnings FV | Post-Earnings FV | Change |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|--------|
| DDM Base (60%) | $29.24 | $29.24 | No change |
| DCF Base (40%) | $24.94 | $25.50 | +$0.56 |
| **Weighted FV** | **$27.52** | **$27.74** | **+0.8%** |

The slight DCF increase reflects:
- Better confidence in ex-COVID growth (+9% vs +6%)
- Management execution improving (beat expectations)
- But offset by Metsera $10B leverage increase

**New Fair Value: ~$27.75** (essentially unchanged)

### Margin of Safety Recalculation

```
Current Price: $25.53
New Fair Value: $27.75
Margin of Safety: +8.7% (vs +3.2% before)

Price dropped $1.13 since thesis written (was $26.66)
Fair Value increased $0.22 (was $27.52)
Combined effect: MoS improved from 3.2% to 8.7%
```

## Scenario Analysis Post-Earnings

| Scenario | Probability | EPS Implied | Fair Value | MoS vs $25.53 |

## Kill Conditions Check

| Kill Condition | Status | Action |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| Dividend cut | **NOT TRIGGERED** - maintained | HOLD |
| FY2026 guidance <$2.50 EPS | **NOT TRIGGERED** - $2.80-3.00 | HOLD |
| FCF <$8B | **NOT TRIGGERED** - FCF healthy | HOLD |
| Pipeline collapse | **NOT TRIGGERED** - 20 pivotal starts | HOLD |

**All kill conditions clear.**

---

## Decision

### RECOMMENDATION: HOLD

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Beat Quality | **Solid** - ex-COVID +9% shows core strength |
| Guidance | **Unchanged** - already priced in models |
| Dividend | **SAFE** - most important factor maintained |
| Valuation | **Fair** - MoS 8-9% (Tier A needs 15%+) |
| Macro Context | **Neutral** - Pharma defensive, tariffs affect but not critical |

### Action Matrix

| Action | Trigger | Current Status |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| SELL | Dividend cut or guidance <$2.50 | NOT triggered |
| TRIM | Price >$30 (Bull FV) | NOT triggered |
| HOLD | MoS 0-15% + no kill conditions | **CURRENT** |
| ADD | Price <$24 (MoS >15%) | NOT triggered |

### Specific Recommendation

**HOLD the 18.66 shares.** Earnings beat improves confidence but price needs to drop to ~$24 for an ADD to make sense under Tier A rules (15% MoS minimum for quality defensives).

The position remains a **yield anchor** (6.5% dividend yield) with **fair value support** around $27.50-28.

## Catalysts to Monitor

### Next 90 Days
1. **Dividend announcement** - typically declared with Q4 earnings (watch for increase)
2. **Metsera integration details** - Q1 2026
3. **Pipeline Phase 3 readouts** - 20 pivotal studies starting
4. **Eliquis biosimilar news** - 2028 LOE preparations

### Watch Prices
- **ADD at $24.00** (MoS ~15%)
- **STRONG ADD at $22.00** (MoS ~21%)
- **TRIM at $30.00** (approaching bull FV)
- **SELL at $32.50** (bull FV reached)

---

## Summary

Q4 2025 earnings were **better than expected** with a solid beat on EPS (+16%) and revenue (+6%). Most importantly:

1. **Dividend NOT cut** - thesis anchor intact
2. **Guidance confirmed** - $2.80-3.00 EPS for 2026
3. **Ex-COVID growth strong** - +9% shows post-COVID transition working
4. **Pipeline active** - 20 pivotal studies de-risks future

However, the stock remains **fairly valued** at $25.53 vs ~$27.75 fair value (MoS 8.7%). This is NOT enough margin for a Tier A defensive stock (requires 15%+).

**HOLD position. Monitor for price <$24 to ADD.**
