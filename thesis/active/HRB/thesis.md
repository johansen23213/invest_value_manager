## SECTION 1: BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING (Business Analysis Framework)

### 1.1 What Problem Does It Solve?

**Pain Point**: US tax code is complex (74,000+ pages). Americans fear IRS audits and penalties for errors. Filing requires gathering documents, understanding deductions, and navigating software.

**Customer Segments**:
1. **Complex filers** (businesses, investments, multiple states) - MUST-HAVE service
2. **Simple filers who want peace of mind** - NICE-TO-HAVE (could DIY)
3. **Unbanked/underbanked** needing refund advances - FINANCIAL SERVICE

**Classification**: Tax prep for complex situations is a MUST-HAVE. For simple returns, it's increasingly a NICE-TO-HAVE as DIY improves.

### 1.2 How Does It Generate Revenue?

| Segment | % Revenue | Model | Characteristics |
|---------|----------|-------|-----------------|
| Assisted Tax Prep | ~70% | Transaction (seasonal) | NAC (avg charge) rising 4-5%/yr. Repeat customers. |
| DIY Software | ~20% | Transaction (seasonal) | Commodity competition. Double-digit online growth. |
| Financial Products | ~10% | Transaction + fees | Declining (-11% YoY). Emerald Card, refund advances. |

**Recurrence**: ~60% of customers return each year (high retention for transactions).

### 1.3 Unit Economics

```
CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) = ~$35-50
  - Marketing spend ~$400M/yr / ~10M new customers = ~$40
  - Trend: RISING (more digital marketing needed)

LTV (Lifetime Value) = ~$350-500
  - NAC ~$200 (assisted) x 60% retention x 5-year avg relationship
  - Assisted: higher LTV (~$500)
  - DIY: lower LTV (~$150)

LTV/CAC Ratio = ~8-10x
  - EXCELLENT for assisted business
  - MODERATE for DIY (3-4x)

Payback Period = <6 months (excellent)
  - Customer profitable in first tax season
```

### 1.4 Margin Structure

```
Gross Margin = ~55-60% (service business)
  - Primarily labor + rent (offices)
  - Trend: STABLE (franchise model helps)
  - vs Peers: Intuit ~80% (software-only)

Operating Margin = ~23% (EBIT/Revenue)
  - FY2025: $860M EBIT / $3,761M = 22.9%
  - Trend: COMPRESSING (rising SG&A)
  - Fixed costs: ~40% (corporate, tech platform)
  - Variable costs: ~60% (labor, marketing)

FCF Margin = ~15-16%
  - FY2025: $599M / $3,761M = 15.9%
  - Trend: DECLINING (major concern)
```

### 1.5 Capital Requirements

| Type | HRB Profile | Detail |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Capex | LOW | ~$70-80M/yr (2% of revenue) - maintenance only |
| Working Capital | FAVORABLE | Negative WC during tax season (collect before paying) |
| Growth Capex | MINIMAL | Franchise model for expansion |

**Capital-light business**: OCF ~$800M, Capex ~$75M = FCF conversion excellent.

## SECTION 2: WHY IS IT CHEAP? (Obligatorio)

### 2.1 Market Narrative (What the market believes)

- [X] AI disruption narrative - Tax prep is rules-based, AI could automate
- [X] IRS Direct File - Free government alternative now permanent
- [X] CEO transition - Jeff Jones retiring Dec 2025
- [X] Guidance disappointment - Reaffirmed vs raised FY2026
- [X] Debt increase - LT debt rose from $1.14B to $1.73B
- [X] FCF declining - $752M (FY2023) to $599M (FY2025)
- [ ] Sector out-of-favor (rotacion ciclica)

### 2.2 My Counter-Thesis

| Market Believes | I Believe | My Evidence | P(I'm wrong) |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| AI will disrupt assisted tax prep | AI helps simple returns, complex still need humans | Business filers, multi-state, audits require judgment. HRB partnered with OpenAI defensively. | 30% |
| IRS Direct File kills DIY business | Direct File only for simple returns HRB doesn't prioritize | 90% satisfaction but limited scope. HRB's value is in complex situations. | 20% |
| CEO transition is a problem | CEO transition is temporary uncertainty | New CEO announcement expected soon. Business is mature, runs itself. | 15% |
| FCF decline will continue | FCF can stabilize with cost discipline | Decline driven by one-time investments (tech, marketing). Company can cut if needed. | 40% |
| Debt is dangerous | Debt is manageable at 2x EBITDA | Predictable seasonal cash flows. No near-term maturities. | 25% |

### 2.3 Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | Status | Comment |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Industria en declive secular | PARTIAL | Assisted declining slowly; DIY still growing |
| Disrupcion tecnologica inminente | PARTIAL | AI threat real but 3-5yr+ timeline |
| Management destruyendo valor | PARTIAL | Bought back at $61, now $39 |
| Balance deteriorandose | NO | Debt up but coverage OK |
| Insider selling masivo (>5% en 12m) | NO | Not observed |
| Dividend cut reciente o probable | NO | 8 consecutive increases |
| Perdida market share >2pp en 3 anos | NO | Share stable in assisted |
| ROIC < WACC ultimos 3 anos | NO | ROIC ~20%+ (negative equity distorts) |
| FCF negativo >2 anos consecutivos | NO | FCF positive every year |
| Goodwill >50% equity | N/A | Negative equity, not applicable |

**Count: 2-3 PARTIAL = PROCEED WITH CAUTION but not reject**

### 2.4 My Informational Advantage

- [X] Horizonte temporal mas largo - Willing to wait 2-3 years for re-rating
- [X] El mercado sobre-reacciona a corto plazo - 40% drop on guidance reaffirmation is excessive
- [ ] Entiendo el negocio mejor
- [X] Informacion publica mal interpretada - Market ignoring declining share count effect on EPS

## SECTION 3: PROJECTION FRAMEWORK (Derivation, NOT Defaults)

### 3.1 Revenue Projection

```
TAM (Total Addressable Market) = ~$30B (US tax prep services)
  - Source: IBISWorld estimates
  - Geography: US primarily

TAM Growth Rate = ~2-3% annually
  - Drivers: Tax code complexity, population, inflation (pricing)
  - Drags: IRS Direct File, DIY adoption

Market Share = ~13-15% (assisted + DIY combined)
  - Trend: STABLE in assisted, LOSING in DIY vs TurboTax
  - #2 position defended by physical network moat

Revenue Growth Derivation:
  TAM Growth: +2%
  Market Share: 0% (stable, not gaining/losing significantly)
  Pricing Power: +2% (NAC increases)
  ----------------------
  = Revenue Growth: ~3-4%
```

### 3.2 Margin Projection

```
Gross Margin: 55-58% (stable, franchise model protects)
Operating Margin: 22-24% (target stabilization after cost investments)
FCF Margin: 14-16% (conservative assumption: stabilizes, doesn't recover)
```

### 3.3 WACC Derivation (NOT Default)

```
Risk-Free Rate (Rf) = 4.25% (10Y Treasury, Feb 2026)
Equity Risk Premium (ERP) = 5.5% (historical US average)
Beta = 0.35 (yfinance - low due to defensive business + seasonality)
  - Adjusted Beta: 0.67 (weighted toward market beta 1.0)
  - Using 0.67 for WACC as 0.35 is unusually low

Cost of Equity (Ke) = Rf + Beta x ERP
Ke = 4.25% + 0.67 x 5.5% = 7.9%

Cost of Debt (Kd):
  Interest Expense / Total Debt = $78M / $2.03B = 3.8%
  Tax Rate = 21%
  Kd after-tax = 3.8% x (1 - 0.21) = 3.0%

Capital Structure:
  Market Cap = $4.95B
  Total Debt = $2.03B
  Enterprise Value = $6.98B

  Weight Equity (E/V) = 71%
  Weight Debt (D/V) = 29%

WACC = (E/V x Ke) + (D/V x Kd after-tax)
WACC = (0.71 x 7.9%) + (0.29 x 3.0%)
WACC = 5.6% + 0.9%
WACC = 6.5%

Sanity Check: 6.5% seems LOW for a company with disruption risk.
Adjustment: Add 2% risk premium for AI/structural risk
ADJUSTED WACC = 8.5%
```

### 3.4 Terminal Value

```
Terminal Growth Rate = 2.0%
  - Reasoning: Below GDP growth (2.5%) due to secular headwinds
  - Cannot grow faster than economy indefinitely
  - AI disruption risk caps long-term growth
```

## SECTION 4: VALUATION (Multi-Method Obligatorio)

### Method 1: DCF (50% weight)

**Tool**: `python3 tools/dcf_calculator.py HRB --growth 3 --wacc 8.5 --terminal 2 --scenarios`

| Scenario | Growth | WACC | Terminal | Fair Value | MoS vs $38.72 |
|----------|--------|------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Bear | 1% | 9.5% | 1.5% | $46.93 | +21% |
| Base | 3% | 8.5% | 2.0% | $62.83 | +62% |
| Bull | 5% | 7.5% | 2.5% | $85.39 | +121% |

### Method 2: EV/EBIT (50% weight)

| Data Point | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Current EBIT | $860M |
| Net Debt | $1.05B |
| Shares | 126.4M |
| Current EV/EBIT | 6.9x |

**Multiple Justification**:
- Tax services sector typical range: 8-12x
- HRB discount factors: debt, FCF erosion, AI risk (-2x)
- HRB premium factors: duopoly position, brand, buybacks (+1x)
- Fair multiple range: 8-11x (vs current 6.9x)

| Scenario | Multiple | Fair EV | Fair Equity | Fair Value | MoS |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|-----------|-----|
| Bear | 8x | $6.88B | $5.83B | $46.12 | +19% |
| Base | 9.5x | $8.17B | $7.12B | $56.33 | +45% |
| Bull | 11x | $9.46B | $8.41B | $66.53 | +72% |

### Reconciliation of Methods

| Method | Bear | Base | Bull | Weight |
|--------|------|------|------|--------|
| DCF | $46.93 | $62.83 | $85.39 | 50% |
| EV/EBIT | $46.12 | $56.33 | $66.53 | 50% |
| **Weighted** | **$46.53** | **$59.58** | **$75.96** | 100% |

**Divergence**: DCF Base ($62.83) vs EV/EBIT Base ($56.33) = 12% difference
- Acceptable (<30%). DCF higher because it captures share count decline effect.

### Expected Value (Probability-Weighted)

```
Expected FV = (Bear x 25%) + (Base x 50%) + (Bull x 25%)
Expected FV = ($46.53 x 0.25) + ($59.58 x 0.50) + ($75.96 x 0.25)
Expected FV = $11.63 + $29.79 + $18.99
Expected FV = $60.41

Current Price: $38.72
MoS vs Expected: +56%
MoS vs Bear Case: +20%
```

## SECTION 6: INVESTMENT DECISION

### 7 Gates Checklist (Investment Committee)

| Gate | Status | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1. Business Understanding | PASS | Unit economics, model, why cheap documented |
| 2. Projection Fundamentada | PASS | Growth = TAM+share+pricing, WACC derived |
| 3. Valoracion Multi-Metodo | PASS | DCF + EV/EBIT, <30% divergence |
| 4. Margen de Seguridad | PASS | 54% MoS > 25% Tier B threshold |
| 5. Contexto Macro | PASS | US consumer services, not tariff exposed |
| 6. Portfolio Fit | PASS | Position <7%, sector OK, geo OK |
| 7. Autocritica Explicita | PASS | FCF erosion risk acknowledged, 40% P(wrong) |

### Scenarios

**Bull Case ($70-85)**: P=25%
- FCF stabilizes and recovers to $650M+
- New CEO brings fresh strategy, market re-rates
- Share count drops to ~115M by FY2028, EPS grows to $5.50+
- AI partnership becomes differentiator
- P/E re-rates to 12-13x

**Base Case ($55-65)**: P=50%
- Revenue grows 3-4%, FCF stabilizes at $500-550M
- Share count declines 4-5%/yr, EPS grows 7-8%/yr
- Market re-rates modestly to 10-11x forward earnings
- Dividend yield of 4.3% provides floor

**Bear Case ($40-50)**: P=25%
- FCF continues declining toward $400M
- AI/IRS Direct File accelerate client losses (but slowly)
- Debt becomes minor burden but manageable
- P/E stays at 8-9x on secular decline narrative

### Kill Conditions (Immediate Sell Triggers)

1. FCF drops below $400M (confirms structural decline)
2. Dividend cut (signals management has lost confidence)
3. ROIC < WACC for 2+ consecutive years
4. New CEO announces strategy shift away from core tax prep
5. IRS Direct File expands to complex returns

### Decision: HOLD (Position Active)

**Rationale**:
- MoS expanded from 30% to 54% with rigorous v2.0 analysis
- Downside cushion improved: 20% MoS to Bear case (was 0%)
- Fundamental thesis unchanged: duopoly player with declining share count
- Key monitor: Q2/Q3 FY2026 FCF trajectory

**Position Parameters**:
- Current Size: Per portfolio (maintain 3% max)
- Target for ADD: <$35 (would increase MoS to 70%+)
- Target for TRIM: $50 (80% of Base FV)
- Target for SELL: $60 (100% of Base FV)

**Score: 5/10 = Tier B. MoS requirement: 25%. Current MoS: 54%. PASS.**

---

## Autocritica (Obligatoria)

**Asunciones**:
- FCF stabilizes (not continues declining)
- AI disruption is gradual (3-5+ years), not sudden
- Share count continues declining 4-5%/yr
- New CEO doesn't change capital allocation strategy

**Sesgos Detectados**:
- Anchoring on "value" label - HRB feels cheap but cheap can get cheaper
- Confirmation bias - I want the thesis to work because I already own it

**Evidencia Ignorada**:
- FCF has declined 20% in 3 years despite revenue growth - this is not good
- Management bought back $400M at $61, now at $39 - capital allocation error

**Validacion**:
- WACC derived from first principles (not assumed)
- Two valuation methods with <30% divergence
- Value trap checklist completed (2-3 partial factors)

**Alternativas Consideradas**:
- SELL now: FCF trajectory is concerning
- ADD more: MoS is attractive at 54%
- Decision: HOLD is prudent until FCF trajectory confirmed in Q2/Q3
