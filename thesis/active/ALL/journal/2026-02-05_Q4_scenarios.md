---

## SCENARIO 1: BEAR

### Definition
Combined ratio deteriorates to >100% (underwriting loss), high catastrophe losses, weak guidance for 2026.

### Specific Triggers
- Combined ratio Q4 > 100% (vs 80% Q3)
- Full year 2025 combined ratio > 92% (vs 88.1% target)
- CAT losses Q4 > $1.5B
- 2026 guidance: combined ratio > 100%
- PIF declining (policies in force shrinking)
- ROE guidance < 15%

### Probability: 15%

### Rationale
- Q3 was exceptional at 80.1% - some mean reversion expected
- Q4 winter storms could spike CAT losses
- But structural improvement in pricing discipline makes >100% unlikely

### Price Reaction Estimate
- Stock likely drops 10-15% to $170-180 range
- Would trade at ~5-6x depressed earnings

### Action if BEAR Materializes

| Condition | Action | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| CR > 100% but temporary (CAT spike) | **HOLD** | One bad quarter doesn't break thesis if guidance intact |
| CR > 100% + weak 2026 guidance | **REVIEW** | May need to TRIM if structural |
| CR > 100% + PIF declining + ROE < 15% | **SELL 50%** | Multiple thesis pillars failing |

**Key Question:** Is it a temporary blip (CAT losses) or structural deterioration (pricing pressure, competition)?

---

## SCENARIO 2: BASE

### Definition
Combined ratio in mid-90s as guided, normal CAT losses, 2026 guidance confirms pricing discipline.

### Specific Triggers
- Combined ratio Q4: 90-96%
- Full year 2025 combined ratio: 88-92%
- CAT losses Q4: $200M-$800M (normal)
- 2026 guidance: combined ratio mid-90s (as expected)
- PIF stable or growing low single digits
- ROE guidance 20-25%

### Probability: 65%

### Rationale
- Management has guided mid-90s consistently
- Q3 at 80% was outperformance, some normalization expected
- Pricing discipline continues
- This is what consensus expects

### Price Reaction Estimate
- Stock likely flat to +5%: $200-$215
- No material re-rating without positive surprise

### Action if BASE Materializes

| Condition | Action | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Results in-line, guidance confirmed | **HOLD** | Thesis intact, wait for re-rating |
| Position size <5% target | **Consider ADD on dips** | Only if price dips below $195 |
| Position at target | **HOLD** | No action needed |

**MoS at current price:** 15.8% - below 25% threshold for ADD
**ADD trigger price:** $192 or below (20%+ MoS)

---

## SCENARIO 3: BULL

### Definition
Combined ratio <92%, strong execution, raised 2026 guidance, potential capital return increase.

### Specific Triggers
- Combined ratio Q4: <90%
- Full year 2025 combined ratio: <88%
- CAT losses Q4: <$200M
- 2026 guidance: combined ratio <90% (outperform)
- PIF growing >3%
- Buyback increase or special dividend
- ROE guidance >30%

### Probability: 20%

### Rationale
- Q3 showed ALL can execute at 80% CR
- Investment income tailwind continues
- Pricing discipline could sustain outperformance
- Market may start re-rating to peer multiples

### Price Reaction Estimate
- Stock likely jumps 10-20% to $220-$240
- Could approach fair value quickly

### Action if BULL Materializes

| Condition | Action | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Stock to $220-230 | **HOLD** | Still below FV, thesis accelerating |
| Stock to $240 (FV) | **TRIM 25%** | Lock in gains per investment rules |
| Stock > $260 | **TRIM 50%** | Approaching Bull FV |
| Stock > $300 | **SELL remainder** | Full value reached |

## Decision Framework Summary

```
Q4 COMBINED RATIO:

  > 100%  ──────────────► BEAR ───► If structural: TRIM/SELL
       │                           If temporary: HOLD
       │
  90-96%  ──────────────► BASE ───► HOLD (add if <$192)

## Macro Considerations (from world/current_view.md)

### Relevant Factors
1. **Fed rates stable (3.5-3.75%):** Good for investment income, no headwind
2. **US recession risk low (25-35%):** Auto/home insurance demand stable
3. **Iran tensions:** NOT directly relevant to US domestic P&C insurance
4. **Tariffs on Korea/Canada:** NOT relevant to ALL

### Industry Context
- P&C industry outlook: Favorable (Fitch)
- Industry combined ratio 2026E: 99%
- ALL target mid-90s = **6-9pp outperformance vs industry**
