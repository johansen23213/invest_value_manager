## 1. Consensus Estimates Q4 2025

| Metric | Q4 2025 Estimate | Q4 2024 Actual | YoY Change |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|------------|
| **EPS** | $8.72 - $9.82 (range across sources) | $7.67 | +14% to +28% |
| **Revenue** | $17.52B | $16.70B | +4.9% |
| **Net Premiums Earned (P-L)** | $14.92B | ~$13.93B | +7.1% |
| **Combined Ratio (P-L)** | 82.7% | 86.9% | -4.2 pts |
| **Combined Ratio Auto** | 90.0% | 93.5% | -3.5 pts |
| **Combined Ratio Homeowners** | 64.1% | 69.8% | -5.7 pts |

**EPS consensus dispersion is notable:** Zacks at $9.82, Yahoo/Nasdaq at $8.72, TipRanks at $9.41. This wide spread ($8.72-$9.82) suggests uncertainty. The $9.82 figure may be outdated; the more conservative $8.72-$9.41 range is likely more reliable given recent downgrades.

**Full-Year 2025 EPS consensus:** $29.81 (+62.7% YoY).

## 2. Key Metrics to Watch

### A. Combined Ratio (TARGET: mid-90s for 2026; Q4 estimate 82.7%)

This is THE most important metric. The Q3 2025 combined ratio of 80.1% was exceptional. Analysts expect 82.7% for Q4 -- still excellent, well below the industry ~99%.

**What to watch:**
- If combined ratio comes in <82%: strongly bullish, execution outperforming
- If 82-85%: in-line, thesis intact
- If 85-90%: acceptable, still good
- If >95%: warning sign, need to understand why

### B. Catastrophe Losses Q4 2025

Already disclosed: **$209M pre-tax** ($165M after-tax). This is LOW:
- vs Q3 2025: $558M (62% lower)
- vs Q1 2025: $2.2B (90% lower)
- vs Q4 2024: likely favorable comparison

This $209M CAT figure is a strong positive signal. Combined ratio should benefit significantly. December alone was only $80M.

### C. Policies in Force (PIF) Growth

Q3 2025 PIF data (last reported):
- Total PIF: 209.5M (+1.2% YoY)
- Auto: 25.3M (+1.3% YoY), new business +23.0%
- Homeowners: 7.6M (+2.1% YoY)
- Protection Services: 171M (+4.4% YoY)

**For Q4, watch for:**
- Continued auto PIF growth despite increasing competition (Progressive, GEICO aggressive)
- Retention rates -- Q3 showed growth partially offset by lower retention
- Expansion progress of Affordable/Simple/Connected products (42 states auto, 24 states home)

### D. Rate Adequacy / Pricing

Critical forward-looking indicator. Management guided "mid-90s" combined ratio for 2026, implying significant normalization from current ~80-83%. Morgan Stanley flagged softening auto underwriting cycle.

**Watch for:**
- Commentary on rate adequacy vs loss cost trends
- Any signs of pricing pressure from Progressive/GEICO
- Homeowners rate environment (property rates reportedly declining for first time since 2017)

### E. Investment Income

Q3 2025 investment income was strong ($3.1B annualized). With Fed funds at 3.5-3.75%, portfolio yield should remain healthy.

### F. Buyback Activity

$1.5B buyback program announced 2025. Watch Q4 execution and any new authorization signals.

## 3. Thesis Confirmation vs Challenge

### CONFIRMS Thesis (Bullish)

| Signal | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------|
| Combined ratio <85% | Validates turnaround is durable, not just low-CAT luck |
| PIF growth >1% auto | Shows pricing discipline without losing customers |
| EPS beat (>$9.82) | Supports re-rating toward sector P/E 10-12x |
| Homeowners combined <70% | Homeowners profitability structural, not cyclical |
| Buyback continuation | Capital return story intact, shareholder-friendly |
| 2026 guidance combined ratio <95% | Conservative guide with room to beat |

### CHALLENGES Thesis (Bearish)

| Signal | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------|
| Combined ratio >90% | Turnaround may be reverting; 2026 mid-90s guide at risk |
| Auto PIF declining | Losing market share to Progressive/GEICO on price |
| EPS miss (<$8.72) | Multiple compression risk, P/E could stay depressed |
| 2026 guidance combined >98% | Approaching underwriting breakeven = no margin |
| CAT reserve strengthening | Hidden losses from prior quarters surfacing |
| Retention rate declining sharply | Pricing not competitive, customers leaving |
| Dividend cut or buyback pause | Capital adequacy concerns |

### THESIS-INVALIDATING Events (would trigger review for SELL)

1. Combined ratio >100% for Q4 (underwriting loss)
2. Management abandons pricing discipline to chase market share
3. Structural CAT losses guidance >$2B/quarter
4. ROE drops below 15%

## 4. Recent Analyst Actions

| Date | Firm | Action | Target | Notes |
|------|------|--------|--------|-------|
| Jan 6, 2026 | KBW | Maintain Outperform | $250 -> $254 | Raised target |
| Jan 26, 2026 | InvestorPlace (Navellier) | Upgrade | - | Blue-chip upgrade |
| Dec 19, 2025 | Zacks | Downgrade | - | Strong Buy -> Hold |
| Dec 18, 2025 | William Blair | Downgrade | - | Outperform -> Market Perform |
| Dec 2025 | Morgan Stanley | Downgrade | $215 | Equalweight; auto cycle softening |
| Dec 2025 | Mizuho | Initiate | $254 | Outperform; expects 15% EPS decline 2026 |

**Consensus:** 13 Strong Buy, 1 Moderate Buy, 8 Hold, 2 Strong Sell. Mean target $240.64.

**Key takeaway:** Analyst community is split. Bulls focus on valuation discount and homeowners strength. Bears worry about auto cycle softening and 2026 EPS normalization (~$24 vs ~$30 in 2025). Morgan Stanley's $215 target is only +1.4% from current price -- essentially saying fair value is here.

## 5. Expectations Matrix

| Scenario | Probability | EPS | Combined Ratio | Market Reaction |
|----------|------------|-----|----------------|-----------------|
| **Strong Beat** | 30% | >$10.00 | <80% | +5-8%, re-rating begins |
| **Modest Beat** | 40% | $9.00-$10.00 | 80-84% | +1-3%, thesis intact |
| **In-Line** | 15% | $8.50-$9.00 | 84-87% | Flat to -2% |
| **Miss** | 10% | $7.50-$8.50 | 87-92% | -3-6%, review thesis |
| **Significant Miss** | 5% | <$7.50 | >92% | -7-12%, thesis at risk |

**Base expectation:** Modest beat given low Q4 CAT losses ($209M) already known. The CAT figure alone should support a favorable combined ratio. Allstate has beaten consensus in each of the last 4 quarters.

## 6. Forward-Looking Considerations

**2026 EPS normalization is the real debate:**
- 2025E EPS: ~$29.81
- 2026E EPS: ~$24.13 (consensus, -19%)
- This decline is EXPECTED due to combined ratio normalizing from ~82-88% toward mid-90s
- At current ~$212 and $24 EPS 2026, forward P/E = 8.8x (still cheap vs sector 12.9x)

**What matters most on the call:**
1. 2026 combined ratio guidance specificity (is "mid-90s" still the guide?)
2. Auto pricing environment commentary
3. CAT loss outlook and reinsurance program
4. Capital return plans (new buyback authorization?)
5. PIF growth trajectory and competitive positioning

---

## 7. Position Management

**Current position:** 2 shares, ~$400 EUR, ~4% of portfolio. Small position.

**Pre-earnings action:** HOLD. No change recommended.

**Post-earnings scenarios:**
- **Strong results + favorable 2026 guide:** Consider adding if price stays below $230 (intrinsic value $240)
- **In-line results:** Hold, thesis intact
- **Miss + deteriorating outlook:** Review thesis; if combined ratio guidance >100%, evaluate exit
- **Significant miss:** Immediate thesis review required

---

## 8. Self-Assessment

**Assumptions in this analysis:**
- CAT losses of $209M (disclosed) will translate to favorable combined ratio
- EPS consensus range of $8.72-$9.82 is reasonably accurate
- 2026 normalization to ~$24 EPS is base case

**Potential biases:**
- Confirmation bias: we own the stock, may interpret data favorably
- Anchoring: bought at $197.65, may anchor to that price
- Recency bias: Q3 was exceptional; Q4 may not repeat that level

**What could I be wrong about:**
- Combined ratio 80% may have been a one-quarter anomaly (low CAT + reserve releases)
- Morgan Stanley's auto cycle thesis could be correct -- 2026 could see real margin compression
- The "cheap P/E" might reflect the market correctly pricing in earnings normalization

**Mitigant:** Position is intentionally small (2 shares, ~4% portfolio). Even worst-case, limited downside impact to portfolio.
