---

## Key Metrics to Watch

### 1. Free Cash Flow (FCF)
- **Q3 2025:** $17.4B (very strong)
- **Expected Q4:** $8-10B (seasonally weaker)
- **FY 2025 Guidance:** ~$40B

### 2. Shareholder Returns
- **Q3 Buyback:** $3.5B
- **Expected Q4:** $3.5B confirmation
- **Annualized:** $14B/year

### 3. Production
- **Current:** ~1.8 MMboe/d
- **Watch for:** Decline signals or growth investments

### 4. Net Debt
- **Target:** <$40B
- **Q3 2025:** $41B
- **Watch for:** Trend direction

### 5. Integrated Gas / LNG
- **Key differentiator:** #1 global LNG position
- **Watch for:** Contract wins, volume guidance

---

## SCENARIO 1: BEAR (-15% implied move)

### Conditions
- FCF < $8B (miss expectations)
- Buyback reduced to $2.5-3B (cut signal)
- Weak guidance for 2026
- Net debt rising >$45B
- Production declining faster than expected
- CEO hints at dividend sustainability review

### Probability: 20%

### What This Means
- Market loses confidence in cash return story
- Questions about dividend sustainability emerge
- Energy transition concerns resurface
- Stock could drop to £23-25 range

### Action
| Action | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Immediate | HOLD - do not panic sell |
| Review | Verify if kill conditions triggered |
| Threshold | If FCF sustained <$30B/year AND dividend cut → SELL |
| Opportunity | If drops to <£22, MoS becomes attractive (~20%) for ADD |

**Rationale:** A single weak quarter does not invalidate the thesis. Oil/gas is cyclical. Only sell if structural deterioration confirmed over 2+ quarters.

### Kill Condition Check
- [ ] FCF < $30B/year sustained → NOT yet (one quarter ≠ sustained)
- [ ] Net debt > $55B → NOT triggered at $45B
- [ ] Dividend cut → Watch closely
- [ ] Production < 1.5 MMboe/d → NOT triggered

---

## SCENARIO 2: BASE (±5% implied move)

### Conditions
- FCF $8-10B (inline)
- Buyback $3.5B confirmed
- Guidance reaffirmed for 2026
- Net debt stable ~$40B
- Production stable ~1.8 MMboe/d
- No surprises on dividend

### Probability: 55%

### What This Means
- Business performing as expected
- Cash machine continues
- Market reaction muted (fairly valued already)
- Stock likely stays £26-29 range

### Action
| Action | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Immediate | HOLD position |
| No change | Position sized correctly at 3.6% |
| Next review | Q1 2026 earnings |
| ADD trigger | Only if price drops <£24 |

**Rationale:** Fairly valued per v2.0 analysis. No reason to add (MoS ~0%) or sell (not overvalued). HOLD and collect implicit dividend yield (~4%).

---

## SCENARIO 3: BULL (+10% implied move)

### Conditions
- FCF > $10B (beat)
- Buyback increased to $4B+
- Dividend raise announcement
- Strong 2026 guidance (capex discipline)
- LNG contract wins highlighted
- Net debt dropping <$38B

### Probability: 25%

### What This Means
- Exceeds already-low expectations
- Re-rating potential if market sees quality
- Stock could rally to £30-32

### Action
| Action | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Immediate | HOLD position |
| At £30+ | Consider TRIM 25% (fair value reached) |
| At £32+ | TRIM 50% (v2.0 FV exceeded) |
| Rebalance | Redirect to higher MoS opportunities |

**Rationale:** Per investment-rules skill, sell partial at 80% of FV base (already there) and at 100% FV. If bull scenario plays out and price reaches £30-32, that exceeds v2.0 FV of £26.8 by 12-19%.

## Geopolitical Hedge Value

**Critical Context from world/current_view.md:**

Shell acts as a **geopolitical hedge** in the portfolio:

| Risk Event | Probability | Oil Impact | Shell Impact |
|------------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| US-Iran conflict escalation | 30-40% (rising) | +30-50% ($90-100 Brent) | +15-25% |
| Hormuz Strait disruption | 15-20% | +50-80% | +20-40% |
| Russia-Ukraine escalation | 10-15% | +10-20% | +5-10% |

**Implication:** Even at "fairly valued" per fundamental analysis, Shell provides portfolio insurance against geopolitical tail risks. This optionality value is NOT captured in standard valuation.

### Adjusted View

| Valuation Component | Value | Notes |
|---------------------|-------|-------|
| Fundamental FV | £26.8 | EV/EBIT + P/FCF weighted |
| Geopolitical Option Value | +£2-5 | Unquantified tail hedge |
| Strategic Hold Value | Yes | 3.6% position reasonable |

---

## Summary Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Probability | Price Target | Action |
|----------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| BEAR | 20% | £23-25 | HOLD, watch kill conditions |
| BASE | 55% | £26-29 | HOLD |
| BULL | 25% | £30-32 | TRIM at £30+ |

### Standing Order (if price moves before next session)

| Trigger | Action | Size |
|---------|--------|------|
| < £22 | ADD | 2% portfolio |
| > £30 | TRIM | 25% of position |
| Dividend cut announced | REVIEW | Potential SELL |
