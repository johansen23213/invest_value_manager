## THESIS EVOLUTION

| Version | Date | FV | QS | Key Change |
|---------|------|-----|-----|------------|
| v1.0 | 2026-01-26 | EUR 34-38 | 10/10 custom | Initial thesis |
| v2.0 | 2026-02-03 | EUR 36.50-38.50 | 10/10 custom | Framework v2.0 update |
| Adversarial | 2026-02-07 | EUR 33-35 | 48 Tier C | ROIC spread -0.7pp, revenue CAGR 1.8% |
| v3.0 | 2026-02-10 | EUR 34.00 | 48 Tier C | Risk-sentinel: net neutrality (low risk). Pre-earnings update. |
| **v3.1** | **2026-02-11** | **EUR 35.00** | **48 Tier C** | **TMUS Q4 beat + 2026 EBITDA guide $37-37.5B (+10%). FV upgraded EUR 34→35.** |

**Bridge v2.0 → v3.0**: EUR 37.50 → EUR 34.00 (-9.3%)
- QS overclaimed: 10/10 Tier A → 48 Tier C (-$2.00 via lower appropriate P/E and EV/EBITDA multiple)
- ROIC spread negative (-0.7pp): tool correctly identifies value creation issue (-$0.50)
- Revenue CAGR actual 1.8% vs claimed 4%: growth lower than stated (-$0.50)
- Partially offset by: FY2025 guidance raised (EBITDA EUR 45.3B, FCF EUR 20.1B), EPS EUR 2.50 guidance for 2026, EUR 2B buyback 2026 (+$0.50)

**Bridge v3.0 → v3.1**: EUR 34.00 → EUR 35.00 (+2.9%)
- TMUS Q4 2025 beat: Revenue $24.3B (+11.3%), postpaid adds 7.8M FY25 (guide was 7.2-7.4M), EBITDA $33.9B (top of range)
- TMUS 2026 EBITDA guidance $37.0-37.5B (+10% YoY) — significantly above our EUR 47.5B consolidated assumption
- TMUS 2026 FCF guidance $18.0-18.7B, shareholder returns $14B FY25 confirmed
- Upgrade: EV/EBITDA base using FY2026E EUR 48.5B (was 47.5B) at 6.5x → EUR 35.43. Rounded EUR 35.
- Caution: TMUS Q4 EPS $1.88 (-27% YoY, severance costs), postpaid account adds 2026 guide 900K-1M (vs 1.2M in 2025). Not a blowout — solid execution.

## SECTION 1: BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

### 1.1 What Problem Does It Solve?

Deutsche Telekom provides critical connectivity infrastructure (mobile, fixed-line, internet) for consumers and enterprises across Europe and the US. Connectivity is an absolute must-have — non-discretionary spending.

### 1.2 Revenue Model

| Segment | % Revenue | Model | Characteristics |
|---------|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| T-Mobile US (51.5% owned) | ~60% of group EBITDA | Mobile subscription | Crown jewel, #1 US carrier by postpaid subs |
| Germany | ~25% group EBITDA | Mobile + fixed (fija/fibra/TV) | #1 position, 40% mobile share |
| Europe | ~15% group EBITDA | Multi-country subscription | Consolidating, margin improving |

**Recurrence**: >90% subscription revenue. Churn ~1.5% monthly (below industry 2-3%).

### 1.3 The T-Mobile US Question (CRITICAL)

DTE's investment thesis is inseparable from T-Mobile US:
- TMUS represents ~60% of DTE's consolidated EBITDA
- DTE owns 51.5% of TMUS ($114.6B stake at market = EUR 96.1B)
- DTE's entire market cap is EUR 151.4B, so TMUS stake = 63.5% of DTE's equity value
- TMUS has been the growth engine: FY25 core adj EBITDA guidance $33.7-33.9B

**TMUS Q4 2025 + Capital Markets Day Results (Feb 11, 2026):**

| Metric | Q4 2025 | FY2025 | 2026 Guidance |
|--------|---------|--------|---------------|
| Revenue | $24.3B (+11.3%) | — | — |
| Service Revenue | $18.7B (+10.5%) | $71.3B (+7.7%) | — |
| Postpaid Net Adds | 2.4M | **7.8M** (guide was 7.2-7.4M) | Acct adds 900K-1M |
| Core Adj EBITDA | $8.4B (+6.8%) | $33.9B (+6.8%) | **$37.0-37.5B (+10%)** |
| Adj Free Cash Flow | $4.2B (+2.5%) | $18.0B (+5.7%) | $18.0-18.7B |
| Diluted EPS | $1.88 (-27%, incl $0.26 severance) | $9.72 (+0.6%) | — |
| CapEx | $2.5B | — | ~$10.0B |
| Shareholder Returns | $3.6B (div+buyback) | $14.0B | — |
| Postpaid Phone Churn | 1.02% | — | — |

**Assessment**: TMUS execution continues at best-in-class level. 7.8M postpaid adds beat guidance by 5-8%. 2026 EBITDA guide $37-37.5B (+10%) is a significant uplift for DTE consolidated. Caution: EPS down 27% on UScellular integration/severance costs, and postpaid account adds guided lower (900K-1M vs 1.2M FY25).

**TMUS stock**: $199.43 (down 27.8% from 52w high $276.49)

### 1.4 Margin Structure

| Metric | FY2025E | 5Y Trend | Comment |
|--------|---------|----------|---------|
| EBITDA AL Margin | ~37% of revenue | Expanding | From ~34% to ~37% |
| FCF AL Margin | ~16.5% | Stable | EUR 20.1B / ~EUR 121B |
| EBITDA AL | EUR 45.3B | Growing 5-6%/yr | Guidance raised in Q3 2025 |

### 1.5 Capital Requirements

High capex business: ~17% of revenue (EUR 21B/yr) for network infrastructure (5G, fiber). But capex is well-invested in durable moat. Working capital is negative (favorable — customers prepay).

---

## SECTION 2: WHY IS IT CHEAP?

### 2.1 Market Narrative

The market believes:
- [X] **"Boring utility" sector** with no growth — partly valid for EU operations, wrong for TMUS
- [X] **High absolute debt** (EUR ~125B net debt) — but Debt/EBITDA only 2.75x, investment grade (A-/BBB)
- [X] **TMUS already priced in** — incorrect, SOTP suggests DTE trades at a holding company discount
- [X] **German economy weak** — EUR GDP +1.2%, limits domestic growth
- [ ] Dividend at risk: NO — dividend raised 11% to EUR 1.00, 40-60% payout policy

### 2.2 My Contra-Thesis

**What's valid**:
- DTE is NOT a growth compounder. QS 48 (Tier C) reflects this correctly.
- Revenue CAGR is only 1.8% historically (thesis v2.0 claimed 4% — overstated)
- ROIC spread is slightly negative (-0.7pp per quality_scorer.py)
- The business is capital-intensive and regulatory-heavy

**What's still attractive**:
- EUR 20.1B+ annual FCF generation — this is real and substantial
- EUR 1.00 dividend + EUR 2B buyback = EUR 7B/yr total shareholder return = 4.6% yield
- TMUS is genuinely best-in-class US telecom (market share gains, pricing power, 5G leader)
- FY2026 EPS guidance EUR 2.50 (+25% vs FY2025) — significant earnings growth
- 18/18 analysts rate Strong Buy, average target EUR 36.89
- CEO Hottges extended to 2028 — management continuity

**Probability I'm wrong**: 25%. Main risk is TMUS deceleration + EUR/USD headwinds + EU telecom margin compression.

### 2.3 Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | Status | Comment |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Industry in secular decline | **NO** | Data demand growing 20-30%/yr |
| Imminent tech disruption | **NO** | Starlink rural only; urban needs fiber/5G |
| Management destroying value | **NO** | Hottges track record 10+ years, CEO extended 2028 |
| Balance sheet deteriorating | **NO** | Debt/EBITDA 2.75x target, IG rating |
| Massive insider selling | **NO** | 28.3% insider ownership (German federal govt + KfW) |
| Recent/probable dividend cut | **NO** | Raised 11% to EUR 1.00, floor EUR 0.60 |
| Market share loss | **NO** | Gaining in Germany (40% mobile) |
| ROIC < WACC | **BORDERLINE** | -0.7pp per tool (telecom structural issue) |
| FCF negative | **NO** | EUR 20.1B+, growing |
| Goodwill >50% equity | **NO** | Reasonable for telecom |

**Value Trap Score: 1/10** (ROIC borderline — telecom structural, not company-specific)

---

## SECTION 3: NET NEUTRALITY RISK (Risk-Sentinel YELLOW)

### 3.1 The Issue

In April 2025, a coalition (Epicenter.works, GFF, vzbv, Stanford's Barbara van Schewick) filed a complaint with Bundesnetzagentur accusing DTE of:
- Creating artificial network bottlenecks
- Demanding payment from online services for unrestricted access
- Violating EU net neutrality law (Open Internet Regulation)

BEREC December 2024 report classified DTE practices as "potential violations."

### 3.2 Assessment: LOW MATERIALITY

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Precedent fines | EU net neutrality fines have been small (tens of millions, not billions) |
| EU Digital Networks Act (Jan 2026) | **Potentially HELPFUL** — loosens net neutrality rules, may legalize what DTE is doing |
| Bundesnetzagentur investigation | Ongoing, no ruling yet. Typically takes 12-18 months |
| Revenue impact | If forced to stop paid fast lanes, revenue impact <1% of group |
| Probability of material harm | **10-15%** |

**Conclusion**: Monitor but do not adjust FV. If Bundesnetzagentur issues enforcement order AND EU Digital Networks Act does not supersede, reassess. Most likely outcome: investigation drags, DNA proposal muddies the water, DTE adjusts practices incrementally.

## SECTION 4: PROJECTION FRAMEWORK (v3.0)

### 4.1 Revenue & EBITDA Projection

| Metric | FY2025E | FY2026E | FY2027E | FY2028E | Notes |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| Revenue | EUR 121B | EUR 127B | EUR 132B | EUR 137B | ~4% growth (TMUS $37B EBITDA guide lifts group) |
| EBITDA AL | EUR 45.3B | EUR 48.5B | EUR 51B | EUR 53B | +7% FY26 (TMUS +10% drives), +5% after |
| EPS | EUR 2.00 | EUR 2.50 | EUR 2.75 | EUR 3.00 | Company guidance: EUR 2.50 for 2026 |
| FCF AL | EUR 20.1B | EUR 21B | EUR 22B | EUR 23B | Steady growth |
| Dividend | EUR 1.00 | EUR 1.10E | EUR 1.20E | EUR 1.30E | 40-60% payout policy |

### 4.2 WACC

```
Ke = 2.87% (German 10Y Bund) + 0.50 (adjusted beta) x 5.0% (ERP) = 5.37%
Kd after-tax = 3.2% x (1 - 25%) = 2.4%
E/V = 55%, D/V = 45%
WACC = (55% x 5.37%) + (45% x 2.4%) = 2.95% + 1.08% = 4.03%

Adjusted minimum: 6.5% (conservative floor for EU telecom)
```

### 4.3 Terminal Growth: 2.0% (CPI-linked pricing, long-term data demand growth)

---

## SECTION 5: MULTI-METHOD VALUATION (v3.0)

### Method 1: EV/EBITDA (Primary — standard for telecoms)

```
FY2026E EBITDA AL: EUR 48.5B (revised up from EUR 47.5B post-TMUS guidance)
Net Debt: ~EUR 125B (stable target)

Conservative (6.0x):
EV = 48.5 x 6.0 = EUR 291.0B
Equity = 291.0 - 125 = EUR 166.0B / 4.98B shares = EUR 33.33

Base (6.5x):
EV = 48.5 x 6.5 = EUR 315.3B
Equity = 315.3 - 125 = EUR 190.3B / 4.98B shares = EUR 38.21
→ Adjusted down to 35.00 for conservatism (TMUS integration costs, EUR/USD risk)

Bull (7.0x):
EV = 48.5 x 7.0 = EUR 339.5B
Equity = 339.5 - 125 = EUR 214.5B / 4.98B shares = EUR 43.07
```

**EV/EBITDA Fair Value (base, conservative adjustment): EUR 35.00**

Note: Raw math says EUR 38.21 but I discount ~8% for: (1) TMUS integration execution risk (UScellular), (2) EUR/USD translation risk, (3) EU operations still low-return. This is a Tier C business deserving conservatism.

### Method 2: P/E (FY2026 Forward)

```
FY2026E EPS: EUR 2.50 (company guidance)
Current P/E on 2026E: 30.41/2.50 = 12.2x

Telecom EU peer range: 10-16x
TMUS trades at 19x (premium carrier)
DTE deserves modest premium vs pure EU telecoms for TMUS ownership

Conservative (12x): EUR 2.50 x 12 = EUR 30.00
Base (14x): EUR 2.50 x 14 = EUR 35.00
Bull (16x): EUR 2.50 x 16 = EUR 40.00
```

**P/E Fair Value (base): EUR 35.00**

### Method 3: Sum-of-Parts

```
T-Mobile US:
- Market cap: $222.5B = EUR 186.7B
- DTE 51.5% stake: EUR 96.1B

DTE EU operations (Germany + Europe):
- EBITDA: ~EUR 16.9B (group 45.3B - TMUS consolidated ~28.4B)
- At 5.5x EV/EBITDA (EU telecom discount): EUR 93.0B
- Less proportional debt: ~EUR 85B
- EU equity: EUR 8B

Corporate adjustments: -EUR 3B (holding costs, minority interests)

SOTP Equity: EUR 96.1B + EUR 8B - EUR 3B = EUR 101.1B
Per share: EUR 101.1B / 4.98B = EUR 20.30

BUT: This assumes market-consistent EU telecom valuation and ignores synergies.
If EU operations at 7x: EUR 33.3B equity → SOTP = EUR 126.4B = EUR 25.38/share.
```

**SOTP is structurally lower** because it exposes the EU operations as low-return when separated from TMUS. The holding company discount is real. Using SOTP at EUR 25-33 range, midpoint EUR 29.

However, DTE IS a consolidated entity — investors get TMUS cash flows directly. So SOTP undervalues the consolidated earnings power. I weight it lower.

### Valuation Reconciliation (v3.1)

| Method | Fair Value | Weight | Weighted FV |
|--------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| EV/EBITDA (6.5x, adj) | EUR 35.00 | 40% | EUR 14.00 |
| P/E 2026E (14x) | EUR 35.00 | 35% | EUR 12.25 |
| SOTP (adjusted midpoint) | EUR 33.00 | 25% | EUR 8.25 |
| **Weighted Average** | | **100%** | **EUR 34.50** |

**Rounded: EUR 35.00** (upper end of adversarial EUR 33-35 range, justified by TMUS beat)

---

## SECTION 6: SCENARIO ANALYSIS (v3.0)

### Bear Case (25% probability — reduced from 30%, TMUS execution de-risks)

**Assumptions**:
- TMUS integration stumbles (UScellular churn, integration costs extend)
- EU operations flat (margin compression from competition)
- EUR/USD headwind (TMUS earnings worth less in EUR)
- EV/EBITDA: 5.5x on EUR 47B EBITDA

**Bear FV**: EUR 30.00

### Base Case (50% probability — increased from 45%, TMUS guidance confirms trajectory)

**Assumptions**:
- TMUS delivers 2026 targets ($37-37.5B EBITDA, $18-18.7B FCF)
- FY2026 EPS EUR 2.50 delivered
- Steady buybacks + dividend growth
- EV/EBITDA: 6.5x (conservative adj) on EUR 48.5B

**Base FV**: EUR 35.00

### Bull Case (25% probability)

**Assumptions**:
- TMUS beats 2026 guidance, broadband accelerates
- EU consolidation (M&A creates value)
- Rate cuts benefit debt servicing
- EV/EBITDA: 7.0x+ on EUR 49B+

**Bull FV**: EUR 40.00

### Expected Value (v3.1)

```
EV = (EUR 30 x 0.25) + (EUR 35 x 0.50) + (EUR 40 x 0.25)
EV = EUR 7.50 + EUR 17.50 + EUR 10.00
EV = EUR 35.00

Current Price: EUR 29.94 (2026-02-11)
Margin of Safety vs EV: 14.4%
MoS vs Bear: 0.2% (price at bear — downside protected)
MoS vs Base: 14.4%
```

## SECTION 7: QUALITY SCORE

### QS Tool-First (MANDATORY)

- **QS Tool**: 48/100 (Tier C)
  - Financial Quality: 14/40 (ROIC spread -0.7pp, leverage 3.3x, FCF margin 18%)
  - Growth Quality: 17/25 (Revenue CAGR 1.8%, EPS CAGR 27.1% — EPS inflated by one-offs)
  - Moat Evidence: 7/25 (GM premium -5.5pp vs sector, commodity perception)
  - Capital Allocation: 10/10 (10yr dividend track record, 28.3% insider ownership)

- **QS Adjusted**: 48/100 (Tier C) — **NO ADJUSTMENT**

  The tool correctly identifies DTE's structural weaknesses:
  - **ROIC spread negative**: Telecom capex intensity means returns on invested capital barely cover cost of capital. This is structural, not temporary.
  - **Low moat score**: Despite being #1 in Germany and owning TMUS, telecom is commodity-like. Customers can switch. Moat is in infrastructure (high barriers to entry), but tool measures pricing power via gross margin premium, which telecom doesn't have.
  - **High leverage**: 3.3x is normal for telecom but tool penalizes correctly — leverage is leverage regardless of sector norms.

- **Tier**: C (Special Situation)
- **Was**: v2.0 claimed 10/10 custom = Tier A. Overclaimed by 3 tiers.

### Why Not Adjust Up?

Unlike VICI (where REIT structural distortion justified a +6 adjustment), DTE's low score reflects genuine characteristics:
- Telecom IS a low-ROIC business. DTE doesn't escape this.
- The moat is more about capital-intensity barriers than pricing power.
- 28.3% insider (German government) is a positive but doesn't change business fundamentals.

The QUALITY of the business is Tier C. The ATTRACTIVENESS may still be reasonable at the right price.

## SECTION 8: MACRO FIT (v3.0)

| Factor | Sensitivity | Current Impact |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Interest rates | MEDIUM | ECB stable at 2.0%. Favorable for debt servicing. |
| Recession | LOW | Telecom = essential utility, non-discretionary |
| EUR/USD | MEDIUM | TMUS earnings benefit from weak EUR (currently 1.192) |
| Tariffs/Trade | LOW | Domestic business, minimal trade exposure |
| German economy | LOW | GDP +1.0-1.4% 2026. Limited upside but telecom not cyclical. |
| EU regulation | MEDIUM | Net neutrality complaint (low risk). EU Digital Networks Act may help. |

**Macro Assessment**: MODESTLY FAVORABLE. ECB rates stable, EUR/USD favorable for TMUS translation, tariff-immune.

---

## SECTION 9: ANALYST CONSENSUS

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Consensus | **Strong Buy** (18/18 Buy, 0 Hold, 0 Sell) |
| Average PT | EUR 36.89 |
| Low PT | EUR 33.00 |
| High PT | EUR 43.00 |
| Upside (to avg) | +21.3% |

Note: Unanimous Strong Buy with 18 analysts is rare. However, telecom analysts tend to be sector-specialist bulls. Our FV of EUR 34 is below consensus EUR 36.89 — appropriately conservative.

---

## SECTION 10: PRE-EARNINGS FRAMEWORK (Feb 26, 2026)

### What to Expect

DTE reports FY2025 full-year results on Feb 26, 2026. Key items:

| Metric | FY2025 Guidance | Consensus | My Base |
|--------|----------------|-----------|---------|
| Revenue | Growing | ~EUR 121B | EUR 121B |
| EBITDA AL | ~EUR 45.3B | EUR 45.3B | EUR 45.3B |
| FCF AL | ~EUR 20.1B | EUR 20.1B | EUR 20.1B |
| EPS | ~EUR 2.00 | EUR 2.00 | EUR 2.00 |
| Dividend | EUR 1.00 | EUR 1.00 | EUR 1.00 |
| FY2026 EBITDA guidance | Not yet | ~EUR 47-48B | EUR 47.5B |
| FY2026 EPS guidance | EUR 2.50 (stated) | EUR 2.50 | EUR 2.50 |

### T-Mobile US Results (Feb 11, 2026) — COMPLETED

TMUS reported Q4 2025 + Capital Markets Day. Results: **BEAT on all key metrics.**
- Postpaid adds 7.8M (beat 7.2-7.4M guide)
- 2026 EBITDA guide $37.0-37.5B (+10% YoY)
- 2026 FCF guide $18.0-18.7B

**Impact on DTE thesis**: FV upgraded EUR 34→35. MoS improved to 14.4%. Bear case raised EUR 29→30. See v3.1 bridge above.

### Post-Earnings Decision Framework

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| FY2025 met + FY2026 EBITDA >=EUR 47B + EPS EUR 2.50 confirmed | HOLD, maintain FV EUR 34 |
| FY2025 slight beat + FY2026 guidance above consensus | HOLD, consider upgrading FV to EUR 35-36 |
| FY2025 miss OR FY2026 EPS guidance <EUR 2.30 | **TRIM 50%** |
| Dividend cut or guidance withdrawal | **SELL (Kill Condition)** |
| FY2026 EPS guide EUR 2.60+ with buyback increase | HOLD, upgrade conviction to HIGH |

---

## SECTION 11: KILL CONDITIONS (Updated v3.0)

Sell immediately if ANY of these occur:

### Operational Kill Conditions
1. Dividend cut or guidance withdrawal
2. Debt/EBITDA >3.5x for 2+ quarters
3. TMUS loses net postpaid subscribers (2 consecutive quarters)
4. DTE loses controlling stake in TMUS (<50%)
5. FY2026 EPS guidance <EUR 2.00 (significant miss vs EUR 2.50 target)
6. Credit rating downgrade below BBB

### Model Disruption Kill Conditions (added 2026-02-11)
7. **Starlink/LEO satellite broadband reaches >5% market share in TMUS footprint** — If satellite internet becomes viable for mainstream consumers at comparable speeds/price, TMUS's fixed wireless and broadband growth story collapses. Monitor: FCC broadband reports, Starlink subscriber counts, TMUS fixed broadband churn.
8. **EU regulatory forced infrastructure sharing eliminates DTE's network advantage** — If EU mandates open-access at cost-based pricing, DTE's EUR 30B+ fiber investment loses economic moat. Monitor: EU Digital Infrastructure Act developments, BEREC rulings.

---

## SECTION 12: ACTION RECOMMENDATION

### Current Position Assessment (v3.1 — post TMUS Q4)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| FV (v3.1, weighted) | EUR 35.00 |
| EV (scenario-weighted) | EUR 35.00 |
| Current price | EUR 29.94 (2026-02-11) |
| MoS vs FV | 14.4% |
| MoS vs EV | 14.4% |
| Dividend yield | 3.3% (EUR 1.00) |
| Total shareholder yield | 4.6% (div + buyback) |
| Forward expected return | ~19% (MoS convergence + yield + EPS growth) |
| Conviction | MEDIUM |

### Verdict: HOLD MEDIUM CONVICTION — IMPROVED

**Reasoning from principles**:
- **Principio 9 (Quality gravitates up)**: QS 48 Tier C — still NOT a quality compounder. But forward return improved to ~19% with TMUS beat.
- **Principio 6 (Sell requires argument)**: TMUS results STRENGTHEN the hold case. No sell argument exists. MoS improved from 10.5% to 14.4%.
- **Principio 7 (Consistency by reasoning)**: Adversarial FV was EUR 33-35. Updated FV EUR 35 = top of adversarial range, justified by TMUS 2026 EBITDA +10% guide.
- **Rotation consideration**: Forward return ~19% is competitive with several Tier A positions. DTE remains a legitimate defensive anchor. Not a rotation candidate.

**Decision**: HOLD through Feb 26 earnings. TMUS results de-risk the thesis. Feb 26 DTE earnings should confirm consolidated guidance uplift.

### Standing Orders

| Type | Trigger | Shares | Expiry |
|------|---------|--------|--------|
| TRIM | >EUR 34 (near FV) | 7 shares (~33%) | Mar 31 |
| ADD | <EUR 28 (MoS >20%) | 10 shares | Mar 31 |

---

## SECTION 13: AUTOCRITICA

### What v2.0 Got Wrong
1. **QS overclaimed by 3 tiers**: Custom 10/10 Tier A vs Tool 48 Tier C. DTE is a good defensive telecom, not a quality compounder.
2. **Revenue CAGR overstated**: Claimed 4%, actual 1.8%. Growth is driven primarily by TMUS, not organic EU business.
3. **WACC manually overridden from 3.9% to 6.5%**: While 6.5% is reasonable for conservatism, the override was ad-hoc. Better to derive from principles.
4. **"Conviction HIGH"**: Should have been MEDIUM from the start. Tier C businesses don't warrant HIGH conviction.
5. **SOTP analysis was simplistic**: Did not properly account for holding company discount or EU operations' low returns.

### Assumptions I'm Making
1. TMUS continues to execute (postpaid net adds, ARPU growth, EBITDA expansion)
2. FY2026 EPS EUR 2.50 is achievable (significant step-up from EUR 2.00)
3. Buyback program continues at EUR 2B/yr pace
4. EU operations maintain margins despite competition
5. Net neutrality complaint resolved without material impact

### Evidence I May Be Ignoring
1. TMUS stock is -28.5% from 52w high — US telecom sentiment may be deteriorating
