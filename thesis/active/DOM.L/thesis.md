# DOM.L - Domino's Pizza Group PLC
## Fundamental Analysis & Investment Thesis v3.0
**Date:** 2026-02-10 | **Analyst:** Claude (Orchestrator) | **Status:** HOLD LOW CONVICTION
**Previous version:** 2026-02-03 (v2.0)
**Framework version:** 4.0 (Principios Adaptativos + Adversarial lens)

---

## Quality Score

- **QS Tool:** 61/100 (Tier B)
  - Financial Quality: 17/40 (negative equity from buybacks distorts leverage; FCF margin healthy at 13%)
  - Growth Quality: 12/25 (UK consumer weakness, revenue CAGR ~2%, EPS CAGR negative recent)
  - Moat Evidence: 22/25 (master franchise exclusivity, 54% market share, supply chain lock-in)
  - Capital Allocation: 10/10 (buybacks + dividends, low capex, franchisee-funded growth)
- **QS Adjusted:** 61/100 (Tier B) — No adjustment. Tool captures the business accurately. Moat high justified (franchise monopoly). Financial low justified (negative equity is structural, not distress, but tool penalizes correctly given leverage ratios).
- **Tier:** B (Quality Value)

## Executive Summary

Domino's Pizza Group is the exclusive master franchisee for Domino's in the UK and Ireland, operating a 100% franchised, asset-light model with ~1,400 stores and 53.7% UK pizza delivery market share (+560bp YoY). The stock trades at 193.9p, down ~36% from its 52-week high (302.8p), due to a CEO departure (Nov 2025), a profit warning (Aug 2025), and UK consumer weakness.

**v3.0 UPDATE:** Three material developments since v2.0:
1. **New CEO appointed:** Dominic Paul (ex-Costa Coffee MD who led £3.9B sale to Coca-Cola) starting April 6 — removes key strategic overhang
2. **H1 2025 PBT fell 14.8%** to £43.7M confirming FY25 as a trough year — but market share gains accelerated (+560bp)
3. **Store openings slowed dramatically:** mid-twenties target for FY25 vs 54 in FY24 — growth engine decelerating

Fair value revised to **240p** (v2.0: 294p, -18.4%). At 193.9p, MoS is 19.2% — below Tier B typical 20-25%. Position is marginal. HOLD through FY25 results March 5, decision framework below.

## SECTION 1: BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

### 1.1 Business Model
Domino's Pizza Group is a **master franchisee** — NOT a pizza company. Revenue comes from:
- **Supply chain (67%)**: Franchisees MUST buy all ingredients, dough, equipment from DPG
- **Royalties (~4.25% of franchisee sales)**: Recurring fee on system sales
- **Real estate (lease arbitrage)**: DPG leases locations, sub-leases to franchisees

Capital-light, high-FCF-conversion model. DPG's success depends on franchisee store economics.

### 1.2 Unit Economics (Updated)

**Franchisee Level:**
```
Average Store Sales: ~£1.15M/year (H1 2025 implied, down from £1.2M)
Average Store Profit: est. £150-160K/year (squeezed from £168K by NLW/NIC)
Store Opening Cost: ~£300-350K
Payback Period: ~2-2.5 years (still good but stretching)
```

**DPG Level:**
```
Revenue: £682M (FY25E consensus) vs £669M (FY24)
EBITDA: £133M (FY25E consensus) vs £143.4M (FY24) → -7.3%
FCF: £57M (FY25E consensus) vs £87M (FY24) → -34.5%
Capex: £13-19M/year (<3% of revenue)
```

**Critical observation v3.0:** The FCF decline from £87M to £57M is significantly worse than EBITDA decline (£143M to £133M). Working capital absorption and higher lease payments are consuming cash. This was NOT reflected in v2.0.

### 1.3 Margin Structure

| Metric | FY24 | FY25E | H1 2025 Actual | Trend |
|--------|------|-------|----------------|-------|
| Gross Margin | 28% | ~27.5% | 27.2% | Slightly compressing |
| EBITDA Margin | 21.4% | ~19.5% | 18.4% (H1) | Compressing |
| Net Margin | 11.6% | ~10.0% | 8.5% (H1) | Compressing |
| FCF Conversion (EBITDA) | 61% | ~43% | — | Deteriorating |

**v3.0 observation:** Margins are NOT stable as v2.0 claimed. H1 2025 showed clear compression. EBITDA margin fell from 21.4% to 18.4% in H1. The NLW increase (+£0.59 to £12.21 Apr 2025, +£0.50 to £12.71 Apr 2026) and employer NIC rise (13.8%→15%) flow through the supply chain to DPG, not just franchisees.

## SECTION 2: WHY IS IT CHEAP?

### 2.1 Market Narrative (Updated)
- [X] **CEO departed (Nov 2025)**: NOW RESOLVED — Dominic Paul appointed, starts April 6
- [X] **Profit warning (Aug 2025)**: FY25 EBITDA £130-140M (consensus £133M = low end)
- [X] **UK consumer weakness**: H1 orders -1.5%, collection partially offset (+1.7%)
- [X] **Store openings slowed**: mid-twenties FY25 vs 54 FY24 (pipeline concern)
- [X] **NLW/NIC headwinds**: ~£3M/yr direct DPG cost + franchisee margin squeeze
- [ ] Structural decline: NO — competitors closing, DOM gaining share (+560bp to 53.7%)
- [ ] Balance sheet stress: NO — Net Debt/EBITDA ~2.1x within 1.5-2.5x target

### 2.2 Counter-Thesis (Updated v3.0)

| Market Believes | I Believe | Evidence | P(I'm Wrong) |
|-----------------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| CEO departure = drift | CEO overhang REMOVED. Dominic Paul is strong hire (Costa→Coca-Cola £3.9B) | Track record at Costa, board process | 15% (↓ from 25%) |
| FY25 trough = new normal | FY25 IS trough, FY26 recovery begins gradually | Consensus EBITDA: £133→£138→£144M. Food inflation moderating (4.5%→1.6-2.6%). BoE cutting. | 30% |
| Store growth is over | Store growth slowed but not over. UK has room for 200+ more (54K pop/store vs 35K ANZ) | Management targets resumption post-CEO. New format tests in progress. | 40% (↑ from 20%) |
| FCF permanently impaired | FCF trough driven by working capital and one-offs, normalizes FY27 | Consensus: £57M→£64M→£75M. Capex stable. | 35% (NEW) |

### 2.3 Value Trap Checklist v3.0

| # | Factor | Status | Evidence |
|---|--------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Industry secular decline | **NO** | Pizza delivery share growing. DOM +560bp to 53.7% |
| 2 | Tech disruption | **NO** | 90%+ digital, own app/delivery. NOT aggregator-dependent |
| 3 | Management destroying value | **RESOLVED** | Dominic Paul (ex-Costa) hired. New CFO Andy Andrea March 16 |
| 4 | Balance sheet deteriorating | **NO** | Net Debt/EBITDA ~2.1x, within target. Net debt ~£280M |
| 5 | Insider selling | **NO** | No material insider sales |
| 6 | Dividend cut likely | **LOW** | Payout ratio ~60% of FCF FY25E. Covered. |
| 7 | Market share loss | **NO** | +560bp to 53.7%. Competitors closing. |
| 8 | ROIC < WACC | **NO** | ROIC ~25-30% vs WACC 8.5-9.0% |
| 9 | FCF negative | **NO** | £57M FY25E (trough). Never negative. |
| 10 | Goodwill >50% equity | **N/A** | Negative equity from buybacks (feature not bug) |

**RESULT: 0/10 factors YES. NOT a value trap.**

---

## SECTION 3: NEW DEVELOPMENTS SINCE v2.0

### 3.1 CEO Appointment: Dominic Paul (Positive)
- **Who:** Former MD of Costa Coffee (Whitbread). Led Costa through £3.9B sale to Coca-Cola in 2019
- **Start date:** April 6, 2026 (after FY25 results March 5)
- **Significance:** Removes the #1 overhang on the stock. Strong consumer/franchise background. Costa is comparable business (branded, franchised, UK-centric)
- **Risk:** New CEO may announce strategic reset/investment phase, temporarily depressing earnings

### 3.2 New CFO: Andy Andrea (Positive)
- Starts March 16, 2026
- Both CEO and CFO fresh simultaneously — creates both opportunity (clean slate) and risk (disruption)

### 3.3 H1 2025 Results (Confirming Trough)
- System sales: £777.8M (+1.3% vs H1 2024)
- Underlying PBT: £43.7M (-14.8%)
- UK LFL orders: -1.5% (delivery weak, collection +1.7%)
- Market share: +560bp to 53.7% (very strong)
- 10 new stores opened in H1

### 3.4 Q3 2025 Trading Update
- System sales +2.1% (accelerating vs H1 +1.3%)
- UK LFL +1.0% (improving)
- 8 more stores opened (18 YTD), target mid-twenties by year-end
- FY25 EBITDA guidance £130-140M reaffirmed

### 3.5 UK Consumer Environment
- Food inflation: 4.5% Dec 2025, forecast to decline to 1.6-2.6% through 2026
- NLW rising to £12.71 Apr 2026 (+4.1%). Employer NIC 13.8%→15%
- Direct DPG cost impact: ~£3M/yr (manageable, <2.5% of EBITDA)
- But franchisee margin squeeze is real — store openings slowed partly because of economics

### 3.6 DoorDash/Deliveroo Acquisition
- DoorDash acquired Deliveroo for £2.9B (completed Oct 2025)
- Consolidation in UK delivery aggregators
- DOM.L mostly unaffected: 90%+ orders via own platform/app
- Indirect effect: aggregator-dependent competitors (Papa John's, independents) face higher take rates
- Net effect: slightly positive for DOM (weakens competitors' unit economics)

### 3.7 Store Count Trajectory (KEY CONCERN)
- FY24: 54 new stores (strong)
- FY25E: mid-twenties (~25, -54% YoY)
- This is the single biggest deceleration in the growth engine
- v2.0 thesis assumed 40-50 stores/year. WRONG.
- Causes: NLW squeeze on franchisee ROI, CEO vacuum (pipeline approvals delayed), consumer uncertainty
- Recovery depends on new CEO's strategy + franchisee profitability

---

## SECTION 4: PROJECTION FRAMEWORK (v3.0 Revised)

### 4.1 Revenue Growth Derivation

```
TAM: UK Pizza Delivery Market = ~£4.5-5.0B
TAM Growth Rate = 1-2% nominal (mature market)

Market Share: 53.7% currently
  - Trend: gaining ~1-2pp/year (accelerating from share gains)
  - Projection: 55% by FY27 (competitors closing, aggregator pressure on independents)

Store Growth: REVISED DOWN
  - FY24: 54 stores (14% of 1,381 base = exceptional)
  - FY25E: ~25 stores (deceleration)
  - FY26E: ~30-35 (recovery under new CEO, but NOT back to 54)
  - FY27E: ~35-40

Revenue Growth = TAM (1.5%) + Store Growth (1-2%) + Mix/Pricing (1%) = 3-4% Base
  - v2.0 used 3% — still reasonable for base case
  - But store growth uncertainty increases range
```

### 4.2 Margin Projection (Revised)

```
EBITDA Margin:
  FY24 actual: 21.4%
  FY25E: ~19.5% (consensus £133M on £682M revenue)
  FY26E: ~19.6% (modest recovery, £138M on £704M)
  FY27E: ~19.6% (£144M on £735M)

KEY v3.0 CHANGE: Margins NOT returning to 21%+ as v2.0 implied.
NLW/NIC creates permanent ~1pp drag on EBITDA margin.
New baseline: 19-20% EBITDA margin, NOT 21-22%.

FCF Conversion (of EBITDA):
  FY24: 61%
  FY25E: 43% (trough — consensus £57M FCF on £133M EBITDA)
  FY26E: 46% (£64M on £138M)
  FY27E: 52% (£75M on £144M)

v2.0 assumed 85%+ FCF conversion. This was WRONG.
Actual conversion is 43-61%. Major driver: lease payments, working capital.
```

### 4.3 WACC Derivation (Updated)

```
COST OF EQUITY (Ke):
  Risk-Free Rate (UK 10Y Gilt): 4.5% (up from 4.2% in v2.0)
  Equity Risk Premium (UK): 5.0%
  Beta (DOM.L): 0.9 (restaurant/franchise, lower volatility)

  Ke = 4.5% + (0.9 x 5.0%) = 9.0%

COST OF DEBT (Kd):
  Interest Expense / Total Debt: ~5.0%
  UK Corporate Tax Rate: 25%
  Kd after-tax = 5.0% x (1 - 0.25) = 3.75%

CAPITAL STRUCTURE:
  Market Cap: ~£740M
  Net Debt: ~£280M
  EV: ~£1,020M
  E/V = 72.5%
  D/V = 27.5%

WACC = (72.5% x 9.0%) + (27.5% x 3.75%)
WACC = 6.53% + 1.03% = 7.56%

CONSERVATIVE ADJUSTMENT: +1.0% for
  - New management (execution risk)
  - Store growth deceleration
  - FCF conversion deterioration

WACC USED: 8.5% (unchanged from v2.0 — justified differently)
```

---

## SECTION 5: MULTI-METHOD VALUATION (v3.0)

**Company Type:** Franchise/QSR master franchisee
**Methods:** EV/EBIT (60%) + P/E (40%)
**v3.0 change:** Reduced DCF weight to 0%. DOM.L's FCF is volatile (CV ~0.4 over 4 years from £65M to £100M to £87M to £57M). EV/EBIT and P/E are more reliable for franchise business with stable EBIT.

### 5.1 Method 1: EV/EBIT Normalizado (60% weight)

```
Normalized EBIT: Use FY26E consensus £112.6M
(FY25 is trough; FY26 represents first year of recovery under new management)

Peer Multiples (Master Franchise / QSR):
- DPZ (US Domino's parent): 25-30x EV/EBIT (premium for US growth)
- YUM!: 20-25x EV/EBIT
- McDonald's: 18-22x EV/EBIT
- UK mid-cap consumer: 10-14x EV/EBIT

DOM.L discount vs US peers justified by:
  - Single geography (UK/Ireland)
  - Mid-cap liquidity discount
  - NLW/NIC headwinds
  - Limited pricing power in competitive UK market

Appropriate range: 10-13x EV/EBIT for DOM.L
```

| Scenario | Multiple | EBIT | EV | Net Debt | Equity | Per Share |
|----------|----------|------|-----|----------|--------|-----------|
| Bear | 9x | £110M | £990M | £280M | £710M | 186p |
| Base | 11x | £113M | £1,243M | £280M | £963M | 252p |
| Bull | 13x | £117M | £1,521M | £280M | £1,241M | 325p |

**EV/EBIT Expected Value = (186 x 0.25) + (252 x 0.50) + (325 x 0.25) = 253p**

### 5.2 Method 2: P/E on Normalized Earnings (40% weight)

```
FY26E EPS: 18.49p (consensus, 10 analysts)

UK mid-cap franchise P/E comps: 10-15x
DOM.L historical 5Y avg P/E: ~18x (pre-2024 downgrades)

Appropriate range: 11-14x P/E for current state
  - Below historical due to growth deceleration + NLW drag
  - Above deep value because franchise model, market share dominance
```

| Scenario | P/E | EPS | Per Share |
|----------|-----|-----|-----------|
| Bear | 10x | 17.5p | 175p |
| Base | 12x | 18.5p | 222p |
| Bull | 14x | 19.5p | 273p |

**P/E Expected Value = (175 x 0.25) + (222 x 0.50) + (273 x 0.25) = 223p**

### 5.3 Reconciliation

| Method | Expected Value | Weight | Weighted |
|--------|---------------|--------|----------|
| EV/EBIT Normalizado | 253p | 60% | 152p |
| P/E Normalizado | 223p | 40% | 89p |
| **Weighted Average** | | 100% | **241p** |

**Fair Value: 240p (rounded)**
- v2.0 was 294p → v3.0 is 240p (-18.4%)
- FV bridge: -25p (FCF/margin deterioration), -15p (store growth slowed), -10p (higher gilt rate), -5p (method reweighting), +1p (CEO resolution)

### 5.4 DCF Cross-Check (informational, 0% weight)

DCF tool with conservative inputs (4% growth, 2% terminal, 9.5% WACC): **198p**
DCF tool with moderate inputs (6% growth, 2.5% terminal, 9% WACC): **288p**
DCF tool base scenarios: Bear 170p, Base 250p, Bull 364p

The wide DCF range (170-364p) confirms why DCF is inappropriate as primary method for DOM.L — too sensitive to growth/WACC assumptions given FCF volatility.

---

## SECTION 6: MARGIN OF SAFETY

```
Current Price: 193.9p
Fair Value v3.0: 240p
MoS = (240 - 193.9) / 240 = 19.2%

Tier B typical MoS: 20-25% (per precedents)

RESULT: 19.2% MoS — marginally below Tier B typical range.
This is NOT a clear buy. But NOT a sell either.
```

**Comparison v2.0 vs v3.0:**

| Metric | v2.0 (Feb 3) | v3.0 (Feb 10) | Change |
|--------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| Fair Value (EV) | 294p | 240p | -18.4% |
| MoS | 37.6% | 19.2% | -18.4pp |
| Bear FV | 220p | 183p | -16.8% |
| WACC | 8.5% | 8.5% | unchanged |
| Growth | 3% | 3-4% | unchanged |
| FCF conversion | 85%+ | 43-52% | **KEY CHANGE** |
| EBITDA margin | 20-22% | 19-20% | -1pp permanent |
| Store openings | 40-50/yr | 25-35/yr | **KEY CHANGE** |

**The two key drivers of FV reduction:**
1. FCF conversion was wildly overstated in v2.0 (85% vs actual 43-61%)
2. Store opening pace halved (mid-twenties vs 54)

---

## SECTION 7: MOAT ASSESSMENT

### Moat Sources

| Source | Evidence | Durability | Threat Level |
|--------|----------|------------|-------------|
| Master Franchise Exclusivity | Legal monopoly on Domino's UK/Ireland. Perpetual license. | Perpetual | LOW |
| Scale: 54% share | 3.5x nearest competitor. ~1,400 stores vs ~400 Papa John's | 10+ years | LOW |
| Supply Chain Lock-in | 67% revenue from captive supply. Franchisees MUST buy from DPG | Perpetual | LOW |
| Digital Platform | 90%+ digital orders, own app/delivery. NOT aggregator-dependent | 5-10 years | MEDIUM |
| ROIC vs WACC | ~25-30% ROIC vs 8.5% WACC = 16-21pp spread | Stable | LOW |

**Moat threats (v3.0):**
- DoorDash/Deliveroo consolidation could eventually create aggregator monopoly that demands better terms → MEDIUM risk, 5+ year horizon
- NLW/NIC erosion of franchisee profitability could slow organic growth → NEAR-TERM risk
- DPZ parent could theoretically change master franchise terms → LOW probability, catastrophic impact

**Moat Rating: NARROW (stable)**
v2.0 said "trending WIDE" — but store opening deceleration suggests franchise economics under pressure, not widening.

---

## SECTION 8: RISK ASSESSMENT (Updated)

| # | Risk | Probability | Impact | v2.0 Change |
|---|------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | New CEO strategic reset (investment phase depresses near-term earnings) | 40% | MEDIUM | NEW |
| 2 | UK consumer weakness extends through 2026 | 35% | MEDIUM | ↓ from 40% |
| 3 | Franchisee profitability squeeze from NLW/NIC | 50% | HIGH | ↑ from 30% |
| 4 | Store saturation / growth stalls permanently | 25% | HIGH | ↑ from 20% |
| 5 | FCF conversion remains depressed (<50% of EBITDA) | 30% | HIGH | NEW |
| 6 | DPZ parent changes royalty/franchise terms | 10% | CRITICAL | unchanged |
| 7 | Aggregator monopoly (DoorDash+Deliveroo) demands margin | 15% | MEDIUM | NEW |

### Kill Conditions (Updated v3.0)

1. **FY25 EBITDA < £125M** (user-specified; below guidance trough = thesis broken)
2. **Net Debt/EBITDA > 3.0x** (balance sheet stress)
3. **FCF < £40M for 2 consecutive years** (revised down from £60M — trough is £57M)
4. **Market share < 48%** (revised from 45% — current 53.7%, <48% = structural loss)
5. **Dividend cut** (signals management concern about cash flow)
6. **DPZ parent renegotiates royalty >5%** (currently ~4.25%; increase destroys unit economics)

**Model Disruption Kill Conditions (added 2026-02-11):**
7. **Ghost kitchen/virtual brands capture >10% of UK pizza delivery market** — If CloudKitchen, Deliveroo Editions, or virtual pizza brands operating from shared kitchens achieve significant market share at lower prices (no storefront overhead), Domino's franchisees face margin pressure from non-traditional competitors. DOM.L's moat is the franchise + delivery infrastructure; ghost kitchens replicate delivery without the store costs. Monitor: UK ghost kitchen market share, Deliveroo/Just Eat virtual brand growth, DOM.L order volume trends.
8. **Aggregator platforms disintermediate Domino's direct ordering** — If >40% of Domino's UK orders shift to Just Eat/Deliveroo/Uber Eats (from current ~25-30%), DOM.L loses the direct customer relationship AND pays 15-30% commission, destroying unit economics for franchisees. The moat is the owned app/ordering infrastructure; aggregator dominance turns Domino's into a commodity supplier. Monitor: Domino's own-app vs aggregator order split, aggregator market share in UK food delivery, franchisee profitability trends.

## SECTION 9: PRE-EARNINGS FRAMEWORK (FY25 Results — March 5, 2026)

### Key Numbers to Watch

| Metric | Bear | Base | Bull |
|--------|------|------|------|
| Revenue | <£675M | £680-690M | >£690M |
| EBITDA | <£130M | £130-137M | >£137M |
| PBT | <£80M | £80-90M | >£90M |
| EPS | <16.5p | 17-18p | >18p |
| FCF | <£50M | £55-65M | >£65M |
| New stores FY25 | <22 | 22-28 | >28 |
| FY26 EBITDA guide | <£135M | £135-145M | >£145M |
| Dividend | Cut | Maintained | Raised |
| Buyback | None | Continued | Increased |

### **SELL TRIGGER: EBITDA < £125M** (per user instruction + Kill Condition #1)

### Scenario Responses

**If BEAR (EBITDA < £130M, weak FY26 guide):**
- Review FV downward to 200-210p range
- If EBITDA < £125M → **SELL immediately** (Kill Condition #1)
- If FY26 guide < £135M → move to PROBATION, consider SELL

**If BASE (£130-137M EBITDA, FY26 guide £135-145M):**
- Thesis confirmed. HOLD.
- Watch for Dominic Paul's strategic commentary (starts April)
- MoS remains ~19% — position stays but no ADD

**If BULL (EBITDA > £137M, strong FY26 guide > £145M):**
- FV potentially back toward 260-270p
- Consider ADD to 5% if MoS expands >25%
- Dominic Paul announcement of growth strategy = catalyst

### New CEO Impact on Results
- Dominic Paul starts April 6 (AFTER results)
- FY25 results reflect PRIOR management's execution
- Key question: What FY26 guidance does the board provide pre-CEO?
- Conservative guidance likely (new CEO won't want to miss inherited targets)

---

## SECTION 10: DECISION

### Current Status: HOLD — LOW CONVICTION

**Rationale:**
- FV 240p vs 193.9p = 19.2% MoS. Marginally below Tier B 20-25% typical
- FY25 results March 5 is the decisive moment — 23 days away
- New CEO removes key overhang but execution risk remains
- Position size ~4% is appropriate for current conviction
- No thesis break: market share growing, moat intact, FCF positive

**Why NOT SELL now:**
1. New CEO is strong hire (Costa track record) — removes the biggest bear argument
2. Market share accelerating (+560bp) — franchise model working despite macro
3. FY26 consensus shows recovery trajectory (£133→£138→£144M EBITDA)
4. Dividend yield ~5.7% provides income while waiting
5. Bear FV (183p) is approximately current price — limited downside from here

**Why NOT ADD now:**
1. MoS 19% is below Tier B typical range
2. FY25 results in 23 days will provide much more clarity
3. FCF conversion deterioration is concerning and not fully explained
4. Store growth deceleration raises questions about long-term growth algorithm
5. NLW/NIC headwinds are structural, not cyclical

### Action Framework

| Trigger | Action | Rationale |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| FY25 EBITDA < £125M | **SELL ALL** | Kill Condition #1 |
| FY25 EBITDA £125-130M + weak FY26 guide | REVIEW for SELL | Trough deeper than expected |
| FY25 EBITDA £130-137M (base) | HOLD | Thesis confirmed, wait for CEO strategy |
| FY25 EBITDA > £137M | HOLD, consider ADD | Better than expected |
| Price < 170p pre-results | Do NOT ADD | Wait for results clarity |
| Price > 260p | TRIM 50% | Approaching FV with limited catalyst |
| New CEO announces Cap Markets Day | HOLD through event | Strategic clarity incoming |
| Kill condition triggered | SELL ALL | Thesis broken |

### Position Management

| Metric | Current | Target | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Size | ~4% | 3-4% | Appropriate for low conviction |
| Conviction | LOW | — | Upgrade to MEDIUM only if FY25 base+ AND FY26 guide strong |
| Exit plan | FY25 results Mar 5 | — | Mandatory HOLD/SELL decision |

### Expected Returns (12-18 months from base case)

| Component | Return |
|-----------|--------|
| Capital appreciation (to 240p) | +24% |
| Dividends (5.7% x 1.25 years) | +7% |
| **Total Expected** | **+31%** |

v2.0 had +67% expected return — was overly optimistic.

### Catalysts Timeline

| Date | Event | Impact |

## SECTION 11: AUTOCRITICA v3.0

### v2.0 Errors Corrected
1. **FCF conversion 85%**: WRONG. Actual 43-61%. Led to FV overstatement.
2. **Store openings 40-50/yr**: WRONG. FY25 will be mid-twenties. Thesis overstated growth.
3. **Margin stability**: WRONG. H1 2025 showed clear compression (21.4%→18.4% EBITDA margin).
4. **CEO departure as main risk**: RESOLVED. Dominic Paul appointed. v2.0 correctly identified this but didn't discount FV enough for other risks.
5. **FV 294p**: Overstated by 18.4%. Consistent with adversarial review pattern (avg ~15% overstatement across all positions).

### Remaining Biases
- **Confirmation bias**: We own the position, motivated to hold. Counter: FV cut 18%, conviction downgraded to LOW.
- **Anchoring to v2.0**: 294p may still anchor our perception. Counter: Each method independently produces lower FV.
- **CEO narrative bias**: Dominic Paul's Costa success may not translate. Counter: assigned only 1p FV impact.

### What Could Still Make Me Wrong
1. FCF conversion improves faster than consensus (if working capital normalizes → FV could be 260p+)
2. New CEO accelerates store openings beyond consensus (if 40+ stores FY26 → bull case)
3. UK consumer recovery stronger than expected (if food inflation falls to <2% → discretionary spending recovers)
4. Conversely: FY25 EBITDA misses low end (£130M) → FV drops to 200-210p
