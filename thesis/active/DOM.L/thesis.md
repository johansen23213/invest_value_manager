## Fundamental Analysis & Investment Thesis (Framework v2.0)
**Date:** 2026-02-03 (v2.0 Update) | **Analyst:** Claude (Review Agent) | **Status:** HOLD (previously BUY)
**Previous version:** 2026-02-02 (v1.0)

## Executive Summary

Domino's Pizza Group is the exclusive master franchisee for Domino's in the UK and Ireland, operating a 100% franchised, asset-light model with ~1,381 stores and 54% UK pizza delivery market share (3.5x nearest competitor). The stock has fallen ~39% from its 52-week high (302.8p) due to a CEO departure (Nov 2025), a profit warning (Aug 2025, FY25 EBITDA guided to GBP 130-140M vs GBP 143M FY24), and weak UK consumer sentiment.

At 183.4p, the stock trades at 9.2x trailing P/E and ~12% FCF yield. Using Framework v2.0 with derived WACC (8.5%) and fundamentally-based growth projections (3% base), fair value is ~290p (base), ~220p (bear), ~375p (bull). Expected value ~292p.

**Verdict: HOLD at 183.4p. MoS 37% vs Expected Value. Exceeds Tier B 25% MoS requirement. Position already acquired; monitor for add on weakness <170p.**

## SECTION 1: BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING (Framework v2.0)

### 1.1 Business Model Summary
Domino's Pizza Group is a **master franchisee** - NOT a pizza company. It operates zero stores directly. Revenue comes from:
- **Supply chain (67%)**: Franchisees MUST buy all ingredients, dough, equipment from DPG
- **Royalties (~4.25% of franchisee sales)**: Recurring fee on system sales
- **Real estate (lease arbitrage)**: DPG leases locations, sub-leases to franchisees

This creates a **capital-light, high-FCF-conversion** model with operating leverage. DPG's success depends on franchisee store economics, not running restaurants.

### 1.2 Unit Economics

**Franchisee Level (the actual business):**
```
Average Store Sales: GBP 1.2M/year
Average Store Profit: GBP 168K/year (14% margin)
Store Opening Cost: ~GBP 300-350K
Payback Period: ~2 years (excellent)
Franchisee ROI: 45-50%

Competitor comparison:
- Papa John's avg store: ~GBP 600K sales
- Domino's 2x more productive per store
```

**DPG Level (our investment):**
```
Revenue: GBP 669M (FY24)
FCF: GBP 87M
FCF/Revenue: 13% (excellent for franchisor)
Capex: GBP 13-19M/year (<3% of revenue)
Working Capital: Net user (favorable)

LTV/CAC not directly applicable (B2B2C model)
But franchisee acquisition cost is ~GBP 0 (franchisees pay opening costs)
DPG's "CAC" is minimal; LTV per franchisee store is ~GBP 50K/year for 15+ years
```

### 1.3 Margin Structure

| Metric | FY24 | 5Y Avg | Trend |
|--------|------|--------|-------|
| Gross Margin | 28% | 27-29% | Stable |
| EBITDA Margin | 21.6% | 20-22% | Stable |
| Operating Margin | 15.5% | 14-16% | Stable |
| Net Margin | 11.6% | 10-12% | Stable |
| FCF Conversion | 87% | 80-90% | Strong |

**Observation:** Remarkably stable margins for 5+ years. The supply chain pass-through model insulates DPG from input cost volatility. Franchisees absorb cost fluctuations.

### 1.4 Capital Requirements

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Maintenance Capex | GBP 10-15M | <2% of revenue |
| Growth Capex | GBP 5-10M | New store support, tech |
| Total Capex | GBP 13-19M | ~2-3% of revenue |
| Working Capital | Net source | Favorable cash cycle |
| Capex for 10% growth | Minimal | Franchisees fund stores |

**Conclusion:** Ultra asset-light. GBP 1 of capex generates ~GBP 5-6 of FCF. Exceptional.

## SECTION 2: WHY IS IT CHEAP? (Mandatory Analysis)

### 2.1 Market Narrative
The market is pricing in:
- [X] **CEO departed (Nov 2025)**: Strategic vacuum, uncertainty
- [X] **Profit warning (Aug 2025)**: FY25 EBITDA 130-140M vs 143M FY24
- [X] **UK consumer weakness**: High interest rates, cost of living
- [X] **Sector rotation**: Consumer discretionary out of favor
- [ ] Structural decline: NO - competitors closing, DOM gaining share
- [ ] Balance sheet stress: NO - Net Debt/EBITDA 1.93x manageable

### 2.2 My Counter-Thesis

| Market Believes | I Believe | My Evidence | P(I'm Wrong) |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| CEO departure = strategic drift | Franchise model runs itself; CEO less critical than in operating company | McDonald's, DPZ US have had CEO transitions without value destruction. Board vetted risky strategies. | 25% |
| UK consumer will stay weak | UK consumer recovering as rates fall; pizza is "affordable luxury" | Bank of England cutting rates, inflation falling, DOM Q3 showed resilience | 35% |
| Profit warning = permanent margin compression | FY25 is trough; FY26+ recovery expected | Historical: margins recovered after COVID. New PGF framework approved unanimously by franchisees. | 30% |

### 2.3 Value Trap Checklist (v2.0)

| # | Factor | Status | Evidence |
|---|--------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Industry in secular decline | **NO** | Pizza delivery flat, not declining. DOM gaining share. |
| 2 | Tech disruption imminent | **NO** | DOM has proprietary app, 90%+ digital. Not dependent on aggregators. |
| 3 | Management destroying value | **PARTIAL** | CEO left, but interim COO competent. Historical capital allocation excellent. |
| 4 | Balance sheet deteriorating | **NO** | Net Debt/EBITDA 1.93x, within 1.5-2.5x target. |
| 5 | Insider selling >5% in 12m | **NO** | No evidence of material insider sales. |
| 6 | Dividend cut recent/likely | **NO** | Cut during COVID, restored 2021, growing since. 49% FCF payout sustainable. |
| 7 | Market share loss >2pp in 3y | **NO** | 54% share, stable/growing. Competitors closing stores. |
| 8 | ROIC < WACC last 3 years | **NO** | ROIC ~30%+ (asset-light). Far exceeds 8.5% WACC. |
| 9 | FCF negative >2 years | **NO** | GBP 65-100M FCF annually. Never negative. |
| 10 | Goodwill >50% equity | **N/A** | Equity negative from buybacks (feature not bug). |

**RESULT: 0.5/10 factors YES. NOT a value trap.**

### 2.4 My Informational Advantage
- [X] Longer time horizon (market focused on FY25 trough)
- [X] Understand franchise model better (negative equity is feature, not bug)
- [X] Behavioral edge (market over-reacting to CEO departure)
- [ ] Unique data: NO - using public info

## SECTION 3: PROJECTION FRAMEWORK (v2.0 Derived)

### 3.1 Revenue Growth Derivation

```
TAM: UK Pizza Delivery Market = ~GBP 4.5B
TAM Growth Rate = 0.5% (mature market)
  - Drivers: population growth (+0.5%), delivery adoption
  - Headwinds: dining out competition, aggregators

Market Share: 54% currently
  - Trend: gaining ~0.3pp/year (competitors closing)
  - Projection: 55% by 2028

Pricing Power: Moderate
  - Historical: +2-3% price increases absorbed
  - Deals-focused but maintains pricing in line with inflation

Revenue Growth = TAM (0.5%) + Share Gain Effect (0.5%) + Pricing (2.5%) = 3.5% Base

Scenarios:
- Bear: 1% (TAM flat, no share gain, minimal pricing)
- Base: 3% (slightly below formula to be conservative)
- Bull: 5% (new store rollout accelerates, consumer recovery)
```

### 3.2 Margin Projection

```
Gross Margin: 28% (stable, pass-through model)
Operating Margin: 15-16% (stable)
FCF Conversion: 85%+ of EBITDA

FY25 is trough (EBITDA 130-140M)
FY26: Flat to +3%
FY27+: Return to normalized 2-3% EBITDA growth

No operating leverage needed for thesis to work.
```

### 3.3 WACC Derivation

```
COST OF EQUITY (Ke):
  Risk-Free Rate (UK 10Y Gilt): 4.2%
  Equity Risk Premium (UK): 5.0%
  Beta (DOM.L historical): 1.0 (restaurant/franchise sector)

  Ke = 4.2% + (1.0 x 5.0%) = 9.2%

COST OF DEBT (Kd):
  Interest Expense / Total Debt: GBP 27M / GBP 551M = 4.9%
  UK Corporate Tax Rate: 25%
  Kd after-tax = 4.9% x (1 - 0.25) = 3.7%

CAPITAL STRUCTURE:
  Market Cap: GBP 700M
  Net Debt (FY25E): GBP 280M
  Enterprise Value: GBP 980M

  E/V = 71.4%
  D/V = 28.6%

WACC CALCULATION:
  WACC = (71.4% x 9.2%) + (28.6% x 3.7%)
  WACC = 6.57% + 1.06%
  WACC = 7.6%

CONSERVATIVE ADJUSTMENT:
  Raw WACC of 7.6% is low but justified for:
  - Asset-light, low operating risk
  - Dominant market position
  - Highly predictable FCF

  Adding 0.9% buffer for: UK consumer discretionary risk, CEO uncertainty

  WACC USED: 8.5%
```

### 3.4 Terminal Value

```
Terminal Growth Rate: 1.5%

Justification:
- UK GDP growth: ~1.5-2%
- Pizza delivery market mature, not growing faster than GDP
- Conservative: below GDP

Cross-check with terminal multiple:
- Terminal EV/EBITDA implied: ~11x (reasonable for franchise)
```

### 3.5 Scenario Projections

**Bear Case (25% probability):**
```
Assumptions:
  - FCF FY26: GBP 75M (FY25 trough continues)
  - Revenue Growth: 1% (consumer stays weak)
  - Margin: slight compression
  - WACC: 9.5% (higher risk premium)
  - Terminal Growth: 1%

Fair Value Bear: ~220p
```

**Base Case (50% probability):**
```
Assumptions:
  - FCF FY26: GBP 85M (recovery begins)
  - Revenue Growth: 3%
  - Margin: stable at 21% EBITDA
  - WACC: 8.5%
  - Terminal Growth: 1.5%

Fair Value Base: ~290p
```

**Bull Case (25% probability):**
```
Assumptions:
  - FCF FY26: GBP 95M (strong recovery)
  - Revenue Growth: 5% (consumer recovery + store rollout)
  - Margin: slight expansion
  - WACC: 7.5% (lower risk as uncertainty clears)
  - Terminal Growth: 2%

Fair Value Bull: ~375p
```

**Expected Value:**
```
EV = (220p x 0.25) + (290p x 0.50) + (375p x 0.25)
EV = 55 + 145 + 93.75
EV = 293.75p ~ 294p
```

## SECTION 4: MULTI-METHOD VALUATION (v2.0)

**Company Type:** Franchise/QSR (master franchisee)
**Required Methods:** DCF (50%) + EV/EBIT (50%)

### 4.1 Method 1: DCF (Derived Parameters)

Using dcf_calculator.py concepts with derived inputs:

| Scenario | FCF Y1 | Growth Y1-5 | Growth Y6-10 | Terminal | WACC | Fair Value |
|----------|--------|-------------|--------------|----------|------|------------|
| Bear | 75M | 1% | 0% | 1% | 9.5% | 210p |
| Base | 85M | 3% | 2% | 1.5% | 8.5% | 280p |
| Bull | 95M | 5% | 3% | 2% | 7.5% | 370p |

**DCF Expected Value = (210 x 0.25) + (280 x 0.50) + (370 x 0.25) = 285p**

### 4.2 Method 2: EV/EBIT Normalizado

```
EBIT Normalizado (avg FY22-FY25E): ~GBP 115M

Sector Multiple (franchise): 10-14x
Adjustments:
  + Dominant position (54% share): +1x
  + Asset-light model: +1x
  - UK consumer discretionary: -1x
  - CEO transition: -0.5x
  = Net: +0.5x

Base Multiple: 12x -> 12.5x
```

| Scenario | Multiple | EV | Net Debt | Equity | Fair Value |
|----------|----------|-----|----------|--------|------------|
| Bear | 10x | 1,150M | 280M | 870M | 228p |
| Base | 12.5x | 1,438M | 280M | 1,158M | 303p |
| Bull | 15x | 1,725M | 280M | 1,445M | 379p |

**EV/EBIT Expected Value = (228 x 0.25) + (303 x 0.50) + (379 x 0.25) = 303p**

### 4.3 Reconciliation

| Method | Fair Value (EV) | Weight | Weighted FV |
|--------|-----------------|--------|-------------|
| DCF (derived) | 285p | 50% | 142.5p |
| EV/EBIT (normalized) | 303p | 50% | 151.5p |
| **Weighted Average** | | 100% | **294p** |

**Divergence: 6% - Acceptable (<30%)**

---

## SECTION 5: VALUATION SUMMARY (v2.0)

| Scenario | Fair Value | MoS vs 183.4p |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Bear | 220p | 16.7% |
| Base | 290p | 36.8% |
| Bull | 375p | 51.1% |
| **Expected Value** | **294p** | **37.6%** |

### Comparison: v1.0 vs v2.0

| Metric | v1.0 (Feb 2) | v2.0 (Feb 3) | Change |
|--------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| WACC | 9% (default) | 8.5% (derived) | -0.5pp |
| Growth | 5% (default) | 3% (derived) | -2pp |
| Terminal | 2.5% | 1.5% | -1pp |
| FV Bear | 208p | 220p | +5.8% |
| FV Base | 267p | 290p | +8.6% |
| FV Bull | 339p | 375p | +10.6% |
| FV Expected | ~267p | ~294p | +10.1% |

**Observation:** Lower WACC (derived from fundamentals) offsets lower growth assumption. Net effect: slightly higher fair value.

## SECTION 6: MARGIN OF SAFETY ANALYSIS

```
Current Price: 183.4 GBp
Expected Value: 294p
MoS = (294 - 183.4) / 294 = 37.6%

Tier B (Cyclical Quality) requires MoS >= 25%

RESULT: 37.6% MoS > 25% requirement. PASSES.
```

### Quality Score: 6/10 (Tier B Confirmed)

| # | Criterion | Score | Notes |
|---|-----------|-------|-------|
| 1 | ROE >15% consistently | 1/1 | ROIC ~30%+ |
| 2 | FCF positive 5+ years | 1/1 | GBP 65-100M annually |
| 3 | Debt/Equity <1.0 | 0/1 | Negative equity (buyback feature) |
| 4 | Dividend 10+ years | 0.5/1 | COVID cut, restored |
| 5 | Wide moat | 0.5/1 | Narrow, trending wide |
| 6 | Revenue stability | 0.5/1 | FY25 guided down |
| 7 | Management quality | 0/1 | CEO departed |
| 8 | Analyst coverage >10 | 0/1 | 9 analysts |
| 9 | Market cap >EUR 10B | 0/1 | EUR 800M |
| 10 | Defensive sector | 0.5/1 | Discretionary but resilient |

**Total: 6/10 = Tier B**

---

## SECTION 7: MACRO FIT

From world/current_view.md context:
- Consumer discretionary: more sensitive to cycle
- UK: inflation falling, consumer under pressure but improving
- Not directly exposed to tariffs

**Assessment:**
- Neutral-to-favorable macro fit
- Rate cuts expected in H2 2026 will help consumer discretionary
- Pizza as "affordable luxury" is relatively resilient
- No tariff exposure (UK domestic operation)

**Macro Gate: PASS**

---

## SECTION 8: MOAT ASSESSMENT

### Moat Sources (Quantitative Evidence Required)

| Source | Evidence | Durability |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Master Franchise Exclusivity** | Legal monopoly on Domino's brand UK/Ireland. Competitors cannot open Domino's. | 10+ years |
| **Scale Advantage** | 54% share vs <15% for #2. GBP 1.2M avg store sales vs GBP 600K competitors. | 10+ years |
| **Captive Supply Chain** | 67% revenue from supply (franchisees must buy from DPG). | Perpetual |
| **ROIC vs WACC** | ROIC ~30%+ vs WACC 8.5% = 21.5pp spread | Consistently above |

**ROIC History (proxy via operating margins on low capital base):**
- FY20: ~25%
- FY21: ~28%
- FY22: ~30%
- FY23: ~31%
- FY24: ~30%

**Moat Rating: NARROW (trending WIDE)**
- Narrow because: single geography, single brand, limited pricing power
- Trending wide because: competitors retreating, share gains, supply chain lock-in

---

## SECTION 9: RISK ASSESSMENT

| # | Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| 1 | CEO vacuum prolongs | 35% | Medium | Board oversight, interim COO competent |
| 2 | UK consumer stays weak | 40% | Medium | Pizza = affordable luxury, value deals |
| 3 | Franchisee profitability squeeze | 30% | High | PGF 2025-2030 approved, GBP 168K avg profit |
| 4 | Market saturation | 20% | Medium | UK 54K pop/store vs 35K in ANZ |
| 5 | Leverage stress | 15% | High | 1.93x Net Debt/EBITDA within target |
| 6 | Aggregator competition | 25% | Medium | Own app/delivery, 90%+ digital |

**Kill Conditions (immediate sell):**
1. Net Debt/EBITDA > 3.0x
2. FCF < GBP 60M for 2 consecutive years
3. Market share < 45%
4. Dividend cut

---

## SECTION 10: DECISION

### Current Status: HOLD

**Rationale:**
- Position already acquired at ~183p
- Current price 183.4p = same level
- MoS 37% vs Expected Value (294p) exceeds Tier B requirement
- No fundamental deterioration since purchase
- Thesis remains intact

### Action Triggers

| Trigger | Action | Rationale |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Price < 170p | ADD 1-2% | Increases MoS to >42% |
| Price < 160p | ADD 2% more | Near 52w low, exceptional value |
| FY25 results (Mar 5) confirm trough | HOLD | Validates base case |
| FY25 results worse than guided | REVIEW | May need to lower FV |
| New CEO announced | HOLD/ADD | Removes uncertainty overhang |
| Price > 260p | TRIM 25% | Approaching 80% of base FV |
| Price > 300p | TRIM to 2% | Near fair value |
| Kill condition triggered | SELL ALL | Thesis broken |

### Position Management

| Current | Target | Max |
|---------|--------|-----|
| ~4% | 4-5% | 6% |

### Expected Returns (18-24 months)

| Component | Return |
|-----------|--------|
| Capital appreciation (to 290p) | +58% |
| Dividends (6% x 1.5 years) | +9% |
| **Total Expected** | **+67%** |

### Catalysts Timeline

| Date | Event | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| Mar 5, 2026 | FY25 Results | HIGH - validates/invalidates FY26 outlook |
| Mar 16, 2026 | New CFO starts | MEDIUM - signals stability |
| Q1-Q2 2026 | New CEO appointment | HIGH - removes overhang |
| H2 2026 | UK rate cuts expected | MEDIUM - helps consumer |
| TBD 2026 | Capital Markets Day | MEDIUM - new strategy |

---

## SECTION 11: AUTOCRITICA (v2.0)

### Assumptions
1. FCF remains GBP 80-90M (conservative vs GBP 87M TTM)
2. UK consumer recovers gradually in H2 2026
3. New CEO competent, appointed H1 2026
4. No structural deterioration in franchisee economics

### Biases Detected
- Confirmation bias risk: Already own position, motivated to confirm
- Counter: Applied rigorous value trap checklist (0.5/10), used derived (not default) parameters

### Evidence Not Verified
- Q4 2025 like-for-like sales (not yet reported)
- Actual NLW impact on FY25 margins
- Franchisee sentiment post-PGF

### What Could Make Me Wrong
1. UK recession deeper than expected (bear case)
2. New CEO makes strategic mistakes (can't predict)
3. DPZ parent changes royalty terms (low probability)
4. Aggregators gain structural share (monitoring)

### Alternative Considered
- Could rotate into other consumer discretionary with lower risk
- Conclusion: DOM's 12% FCF yield + 6% dividend yield = compelling total return while waiting
