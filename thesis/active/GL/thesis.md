## 1. Executive Summary

Globe Life (NYSE: GL) is a US-based life and health insurance holding company specializing in underserved markets (low-to-middle income). The stock trades at P/E 10x — a discount to peers (14-15x) — following the 2024 Fuzzy Panda short-seller attack. The two most serious overhangs (SEC + DOJ) have been **fully cleared** (Jul 2025, no enforcement). Q4 2025 confirmed strong fundamentals: FY25 operating EPS $14.52, FY26 guidance $14.95-$15.65 (+5%), BV $74.17, ROE 20.9%.

**Current Price:** $141.42 (10-Feb-2026)
**Fair Value v3.0:** $191 (weighted P/B vs ROE + P/E normalized)
**Margin of Safety:** 25.9%
**QS Tool:** 52/100 (Tier C)
**QS Ajustado:** 55/100 (Tier B borderline) — Ajuste: +3 puntos por SEC/DOJ clearance removing regulatory overhang

**CAMBIO v3.0:** SEC/DOJ clearance reduces risk premium. FV $174→$191 (+9.8%). Conviction medium-low→medium. Book value $70.84→$74.17. EPS guidance $15.03→$15.30 midpoint.

## 2. Quality Score

**QS Tool: 52/100 -> Tier C**
**QS Ajustado: 55/100 -> Tier B (borderline)**
**Ajuste: +3 puntos por SEC/DOJ cleared (evidencia: Both closed Jul 2025, no enforcement, 7 months clean)**

| Categoria | Tool Score | Ajuste | Final | Maximo | Notas |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| **Financial Quality** | 22 | 0 | 22 | 40 | ROIC spread low (tool calc -4.2pp, insurance-specific distortion), FCF margin 23% |
| **Growth Quality** | 13 | 0 | 13 | 25 | Revenue CAGR 3.1%, EPS CAGR 13.2% (buyback-driven) |
| **Moat Evidence** | 11 | +1 | 12 | 25 | Captive agent model = narrow moat (not wide). +1: SEC/DOJ clearance validates business practices |
| **Capital Allocation** | 6 | +2 | 8 | 10 | 5.4M shares repurchased FY25 @$126 avg. +2: Aggressive buyback at depressed prices = excellent allocation |
| **TOTAL** | **52** | **+3** | **55** | **100** | **Tier B borderline** |

**Razonamiento del ajuste:**
- Tool score (52) penalizes GL for: (a) ROIC spread negative due to insurance capital structure (not meaningful for insurers — ROE is the relevant metric at 20.9%), (b) narrow moat (correct, captive agents are defensible but not Wide)
- +1 Moat: SEC/DOJ clearance validates that GL's business practices are legal. The short-seller narrative that GL was committing fraud is effectively debunked at the federal level
- +2 Capital Allocation: Management repurchased 5.4M shares at $126 avg during the crisis — buying at 8.5x earnings when stock was under attack. This is exceptional capital allocation. Original tool score was 6/10 (doesn't capture crisis buybacks)
- Net: 55 = Tier B borderline (previously C with higher risk discount). If class actions resolve favorably, revert to solid Tier B

## 3. BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

### 3.1 Modelo de Negocio

**Que problema resuelve:**
Proporciona seguros de vida y salud asequibles a familias de ingresos bajos-medios en USA que tipicamente estan sub-aseguradas. Es un "must-have" para proteccion familiar.

**Como genera ingresos:**
| Tipo | % Revenue | Caracteristicas |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| Life Insurance Premiums | ~55% | Recurrente, alta persistencia |
| Health Insurance Premiums | ~35% | Suplementario, menor ticket |
| Investment Income | ~10% | Float invertido, sensible a tipos |

**Modelo dominante:** Suscripcion (premiums recurrentes). ~90% ingresos son recurrentes.

### 3.2 Unit Economics (Insurance-specific)

```
Persistency Rate (retention): ~90%+ → Bajo churn, alto LTV
Acquisition Cost: Bajo (modelo agentes captivos AIL + Liberty National)
Loss Ratio: ~55-60% (vs peers ~65%) → Pricing discipline
Combined Ratio: <85% → Underwriting profit + investment income
Life Underwriting Margin: 41% (Q4 2025)
Health Underwriting Margin: 25% (Q4 2025)
```

### 3.3 Estructura de Margenes

```
ROE: 20.9% (FY2025, was 22.3% at thesis creation)
ROE ex-AOCI: 16.0% (ajustado por unrealized gains/losses)
Book Value/Share: $74.17 (was $70.84, +4.7%)
Tendencia: ROE comprimido vs 2024 (22.3%→20.9%) pero aun excelente vs peers (12-15%)
```

### 3.4 Premium Growth by Segment (Q4 2025 vs Q4 2024)

| Segmento | Crecimiento | Notas |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| American Income Life | +6% | Core segment, captive agents |
| Liberty National | +4% | Steady |
| Family Heritage | +10% | Fastest growing |
| Direct to Consumer | 0% | Flat, digital channel |
| United American | +14% | Strong, supplemental health |
| **Total 2026 guide** | **+7-8%** | **Strong premium growth** |

## 4. POR QUE ESTA BARATA

### 4.1 Narrativa del Mercado (ACTUALIZADO v3.0)

| Factor | Status Feb 2026 |
|--------|-----------------|
| Fuzzy Panda short report (Apr 2024) | Fading. SEC+DOJ cleared. Fuzzy Panda "stands by" claims but zero enforcement |
| SEC investigation | **CLEARED Jul 24, 2025** — No enforcement action |
| DOJ investigation | **CLEARED Jul 28, 2025** — No enforcement action |
| Class actions (4 active) | Still pending. No settlement. Legal costs immaterial ($0.04/share Q4) |
| Low analyst coverage | ~10 analysts. Consensus PT $170 |

### 4.2 Mi Contra-Tesis (ACTUALIZADA)

| Mercado cree | Yo creo | Evidencia | P(equivocado) |
|--------------|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Governance risk post-Fuzzy Panda | **Risk overdone — federal govt cleared them** | SEC+DOJ closed Jul 2025, no enforcement | 10% (was 15%) |
| P/E 10x refleja riesgo real | P/E 10x refleja overhang que se disipa | Peers 14-15x con peor ROE. JPM target $181 | 15% (was 20%) |
| Class actions create uncertainty | Class actions are weak post-clearance | No DOJ/SEC backing = plaintiffs weaker. Legal costs $0.04/share | 20% |

**Ventaja informacional:**
- SEC/DOJ clearance is 7 months old but P/E still 10x vs peers 15x → market slow to re-price
- Management aggressively bought back stock at $126 avg during crisis (insider conviction signal)
- Premium growth 7-8% + buybacks = double-digit EPS growth potential

### 4.3 Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | Status | Comentario |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Industria en declive secular | NO | Life insurance demand estable/creciente |
| Disrupcion tecnologica | NO | Captive agents hard to disrupt |
| Management destruyendo valor | NO | $126 avg buyback = excellent allocation |
| Balance deteriorandose | NO | Debt/Equity stable |
| Insider selling masivo | NO | No significant insider selling |
| Dividend cut | NO | 10+ anos aumentando |
| Perdida market share | NO | Stable in niche |
| ROIC < WACC | NO | ROE 20.9% >> cost of equity ~7% |
| FCF negativo | NO | FCF strong |
| Goodwill >50% equity | NO | Minimal |
| Litigio regulatorio material | **RESOLVED (SEC/DOJ)** | Class actions remain but immaterial cost |

**Value Trap Score: 0/10 — NOT a value trap**

## 5. RIESGO REGULATORIO (ACTUALIZADO v3.0)

### 5.1 Investigations — CLEARED

| Investigacion | Fecha Cierre | Resultado | Fuente |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| SEC (securities fraud) | Jul 24, 2025 | **No enforcement action** | [PR Newswire](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/globe-life-announces-conclusion-of-sec-investigation-302513624.html) |
| DOJ (sales practices) | Jul 28, 2025 | **Closed, no enforcement** | [PR Newswire](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/globe-life-announces-closing-of-department-of-justice-investigation-302515325.html) |

### 5.2 Class Actions — ACTIVE but WEAK

| Caso | Status | Impacto Estimado |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| Miami Retirement Fund class action (Apr 2024) | Active, no settlement | $50-150M probable |
| Shareholder class action (May 2019-Apr 2024 class period) | Active, discovery | $50-100M probable |
| Additional class actions (2-3) | Various stages | Overlapping claims |
| **Legal costs Q4 2025** | **$0.04/share** | **Immaterial** |

**Key insight:** Without SEC/DOJ backing, class actions are significantly weaker. The federal government investigated and found nothing actionable. Plaintiffs now have to prove their case without government evidence, which dramatically reduces settlement leverage.

**Expected class action resolution:** $100-200M total (spread over 2-3 years). At $1.50-$3.00/share, this is manageable for a company generating $14.50+ EPS.

### 5.3 Fuzzy Panda

Fuzzy Panda "stands by" allegations despite federal clearances. This is expected behavior — short sellers rarely admit defeat. The market has largely moved on: stock recovered from $49 post-attack to $141 current (+188%).

---

## 6. CONTEXTO MACRO

### 6.1 Sensibilidad Macro

| Factor | Sensibilidad | Impacto Actual |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Tasas de interes | POSITIVA | Higher rates = better investment income (partially offset in Q4: excess inv income -16%) |
| Recesion | BAJA | Life insurance demand inelastic |
| Inflacion | BAJA | Pricing power, costs mostly fixed |
| USD strength | NINGUNA | 100% US operations |
| Tariffs | NINGUNA | Not exposed |

**Veredicto Macro: FAVORABLE** (no exposure to major risks, rates help investment income)

---

## 7. PROYECCION (ACTUALIZADA con Q4 2025 data)

### 7.1 Revenue Projection

```
TAM (US Life Insurance): ~$800B premiums annually
GL Market Share: ~1.5% (niche, underserved)
Management 2026 Guidance: Premium revenue +7-8%

Revenue Growth Derivation:
  TAM Growth: +2%
  Market Share: +0.5pp (guided premium growth implies share gain)
  Pricing: +2-3% (inflation + health premium increase 14-16%)
  = Revenue Growth: ~5% (Base case, management guides 7-8% on premiums)

Projection:
  Bear: 3% (macro slowdown)
  Base: 5% (TAM + share + pricing)
  Bull: 8% (full guided premium growth flows through)
```

### 7.2 EPS Projection (KEY METRIC for insurance)

```
FY2025 Actual: $14.52 operating EPS
FY2026 Guidance: $14.95-$15.65 (midpoint $15.30)
Implied EPS Growth: +5.4%

Components:
  Premium growth: +7-8% revenue
  Margin expansion: Underwriting margins guided 41.5-44.5% life
  Buybacks: 5.4M shares FY25 = ~6% share count reduction
  Investment income: Slightly declining (excess inv income -16%)

EPS CAGR (3yr forward): 5-8%
  = premium growth (~7%) + buyback accretion (~5-6%) - margin normalization (~2-3%)
```

### 7.3 WACC Derivation

```
Risk-Free Rate (10Y Treasury): 4.4%
Beta (GL): 0.464 (very defensive)
Equity Risk Premium: 5.0% (standard US)

Cost of Equity (Ke) = 4.4% + 0.464 * 5.0% = 6.7%

Company-specific risk premium: +1.0% (was +1.4%, reduced from v2.0 due to SEC/DOJ clearance)
Adjusted Ke: 7.7% (was 7.5% — slight increase from higher Rf, offset by lower company-specific risk)

Cost of Debt (Kd after-tax): 3.95%
Capital Structure: 80.6% equity, 19.4% debt

WACC = (80.6% * 7.7%) + (19.4% * 3.95%) = 6.2% + 0.8% = 7.0%
```

---

## 8. VALORACION MULTI-METODO (v3.0 ACTUALIZADA)

### Tipo de Empresa: FINANCIAL (Life/Health Insurance)
### Metodos: P/B vs ROE (60%) + P/E Normalized (40%)

### 8.1 Metodo 1: P/B vs ROE (Peso 60%)

```
P/B Justificado = (ROE - g) / (Ke - g)

Updated Inputs (v3.0):
  Book Value per Share: $74.17 (was $70.84, +4.7%)
  ROE FY2025: 20.9% (was 22.3%)
  ROE ex-AOCI: 16.0%
  g = 3% (sustainable growth)
  Ke = 7.7% (adjusted)

Conservative (ROE 16%):
  P/B = (16% - 3%) / (7.7% - 3%) = 13% / 4.7% = 2.77x
  FV = 2.77 * $74.17 = $205

Moderate (ROE 18%, normalized):
  P/B = (18% - 3%) / (7.7% - 3%) = 15% / 4.7% = 3.19x
  FV = 3.19 * $74.17 = $237

Actual (ROE 20.9%):
  P/B = (20.9% - 3%) / (7.7% - 3%) = 17.9% / 4.7% = 3.81x
  FV = 3.81 * $74.17 = $283

BLEND (33/33/33):
  FV P/B method = ($205 + $237 + $283) / 3 = $242
```

### 8.2 Metodo 2: P/E Normalized (Peso 40%)

```
FY2026 Guidance Midpoint: $15.30 operating EPS

Peer P/E Comparables (Feb 2026):
  MET: ~15x
  PRU: ~15x
  AFL: ~14.7x (most comparable)
  Peer Median: ~15x

GL Quality Adjustment:
  + Superior ROE (21% vs peer 12-15%): +1x
  - Class actions still pending: -1.5x
  - Low coverage / liquidity: -0.5x
  Net adjustment: -1x
  Target P/E: 14x (was 11.5x in v2.0 — SEC/DOJ clearance reduces discount)

Conservative P/E (12x — residual uncertainty):
  FV = 12 * $15.30 = $184

Base P/E (14x — reduced Fuzzy Panda discount post-clearance):
  FV = 14 * $15.30 = $214

BLEND (50/50):
  FV P/E method = ($184 + $214) / 2 = $199
```

### 8.3 Weighted Fair Value

| Metodo | Fair Value | Peso | Weighted FV |
|--------|-----------|------|-------------|
| P/B vs ROE | $242 | 60% | $145.2 |
| P/E Normalized | $199 | 40% | $79.6 |
| **Weighted Average** | | 100% | **$225** |

### 8.4 Adopted Fair Value (conservador)

The weighted average ($225) is aggressive. Aplicando un haircut de 15% por:
- Class actions aun activas (descuento de litigacion: -5%)
- Insurance sector low-coverage (descuento iliquidez: -5%)
- ROE may normalize further from 20.9% to 16-18% ex-AOCI (-5%)

**Adopted FV: $191** (~P/E 12.5x on $15.30 midpoint)

This is conservative vs:
- JPMorgan target: $181 (Overweight)
- Truist target: $180 (Buy)
- Consensus target: ~$170
- Weighted multi-method: $225

### 8.5 Escenarios

| Escenario | Prob | P/E | EPS | Fair Value |
|-----------|------|-----|-----|------------|
| **Bear** (class action surprise + ROE compresses) | 20% | 10x | $14.50 | $145 |
| **Base** (gradual re-rating + earnings growth) | 55% | 12.5x | $15.30 | $191 |
| **Bull** (class actions resolve + full re-rate to peers) | 25% | 15x | $15.65 | $235 |

```
Expected Value = (0.20 * $145) + (0.55 * $191) + (0.25 * $235)
Expected Value = $29 + $105 + $59 = $193
```

### 8.6 Margin of Safety

| Precio actual (10-Feb-2026) | $141.42 |
| Fair Value (Adopted) | $191 |

## 9. KILL CONDITIONS

1. **Class action reveals new material fraud** not addressed by SEC/DOJ → EXIT
2. **Operating EPS falls below $12** (vs $15.30 guide) → RE-EVALUATE
3. **ROE drops below 12% sustained** (2+ quarters) → Moat impaired
4. **New regulatory investigation opened** (state AG, SEC reopens) → RE-EVALUATE
5. **Underwriting margins compress below 35%** (life segment) → Pricing power lost
6. **Premium growth turns negative** for 2+ quarters → Client base eroding

## 10. INVESTMENT COMMITTEE GATES (v3.0)

| Gate | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|

---

## 11. AUTOCRITICA / DEVIL'S ADVOCATE

### Asunciones que estoy haciendo:
1. SEC/DOJ clearance = definitive vindication (Fuzzy Panda could still be partially right about agent misconduct)
2. ROE ~18-20% is sustainable (could normalize to 14-16% if rates decline)
3. FY2026 guidance midpoint $15.30 will be achieved
4. Class actions resolve for <$200M total ($2-3/share)
5. P/E will re-rate from 10x toward 12-14x as overhang dissipates

### Sesgos detectados:
- **Confirmation bias:** SEC clearance confirmed what I wanted to believe
- **Anchoring:** Using analyst targets ($170-181) as validation when they could also be wrong
- **Recency bias:** Q4 results are fresh, may be overweighting them

### What bears argue:
- Fuzzy Panda "stands by" claims — maybe there IS something beneath the surface
- Class actions could produce damaging depositions even if SEC cleared
- Insurance sector structurally challenged by low interest rate future (if rates fall)
- ROE 20.9% includes AOCI benefit; ex-AOCI is only 16%
- Investment income ALREADY declining (-16% Q4 YoY)

### What would make me sell:
1. Class action reveals new material fraud not addressed by SEC/DOJ
2. Operating EPS below $12 sustained
3. ROE below 12% for 2+ quarters
4. New regulatory investigation opened
5. Premium growth turns negative

---

## 12. POSICION Y RECOMENDACION

**Status: HOLD (conviction MEDIUM)**

**Razonamiento:**
1. SEC+DOJ clearance is the single biggest positive catalyst since position opened
2. FY2025 results confirm strong fundamentals ($14.52 operating EPS, above midpoint)
3. FY2026 guidance $14.95-$15.65 implies continued 5% EPS growth
4. Management bought back 5.4M shares at $126 avg = excellent capital allocation signal
5. MoS 25.9% at adopted FV $191 is adequate for Tier B/C borderline
6. P/E 10x vs peers 14-15x = re-rating potential as overhang dissipates

**Conviction upgrade:** medium-low → **medium** (SEC/DOJ clearance reduces major uncertainty)

**EXIT plan:**
- HOLD through class action resolution
- TRIM at $185+ (approaching FV)
- ADD at $125 or below (MoS >35%, back to crisis pricing)
- EXIT if KC#1 (new fraud revealed) or KC#4 (new investigation)

**Standing order: ADD at $125** (MoS 34.5%, near FY25 buyback avg of $126)

---

## 13. CALENDAR / MONITORING

| Fecha | Evento | Accion |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Q1 2026 | Q1 earnings (~May) | Verify premium growth tracking 7-8%, underwriting margins |
| 2026 ongoing | Class action developments | Monitor depositions, settlement talks. Alert if >$200M |
| Continuous | P/E re-rating | If P/E approaches 13-14x, evaluate TRIM |

---

## 14. META-REFLECTION

### Dudas/Incertidumbres
1. **ROE normalization:** FY2025 ROE 20.9%, but ex-AOCI only 16%. If rates decline, ROE could compress further. P/B method is sensitive to ROE assumption.
2. **Class action wildcard:** SEC/DOJ cleared doesn't mean agent misconduct didn't happen — it means it wasn't federal-level fraud. State-level issues or civil damages could still materialize.
3. **Investment income declining:** Excess investment income -16% Q4 YoY. If this continues, EPS growth could disappoint guidance.

### Sugerencias de Mejora
1. **Create insurance sector view:** `world/sectors/insurance.md` should be updated with GL + ALL data and the SEC/DOJ clearance development
2. **Track class action milestones:** Add specific dates as they become public

### Anomalias Detectadas
1. **QS Tool ROIC spread negative (-4.2pp):** This is an insurance-sector distortion. For insurers, ROE is the relevant metric, not ROIC. Tool penalizes GL incorrectly. Noted but not adjusted in Financial Quality (kept conservative).
2. **Yield showing 76% on price_checker:** Likely yfinance data error. GL's actual dividend yield is ~0.8% ($3.60 annual dividend on $141 price).

### Preguntas para Orchestrator
1. Update insurance sector view with SEC/DOJ resolution?
2. Add $125 standing order to system.yaml?
