## Consensus Expectations

| Metric | Q4 2025 Consensus | FY 2025 Implied |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| EPS | $3.44 | ~$15.03 |
| Revenue | ~$1.5B | ~$6.0B |
| Combined Ratio | <85% | <85% |
| Life Premium Growth | ~4% | ~4% |
| Health Premium Growth | ~3% | ~3% |

**Key Focus Areas:**
1. Premium growth trends (life + health)
2. Underwriting margins (combined ratio)
3. Investment income (higher rates = tailwind)
4. FY 2026 guidance
5. Class action litigation update (if any)

---

## BEAR SCENARIO (Probability: 20%)

### Triggers
- **EPS Miss**: Q4 EPS < $3.20 (-7% vs consensus)
- **Premium Growth Stalls**: Life premium growth < 2% YoY
- **Margin Compression**: Combined ratio > 88%
- **Guidance Cut**: FY 2026 EPS guidance < $14.50
- **Litigation News**: Material adverse class action development

### Why This Could Happen
1. Agent recruitment slowed more than expected
2. Policyholder persistency declined (lapses increased)
3. Investment portfolio losses (credit events)
4. Class action settlement rumor/provision taken
5. Management signals structural challenges

### Expected Market Reaction
- Price decline: -10% to -15% ($122-$129)
- P/E compression to 8-9x (from 10.4x)

### Action if Bear Scenario
| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Price drops to $130 or below | **ADD** - MoS reaches 25%+ threshold |
| Price drops to $120-130 | **CONSIDER ADD** - evaluate news severity first |
| Price drops below $120 | **HOLD** - wait for dust to settle, re-evaluate thesis |
| Kill condition triggered | **SELL** - see kill conditions below |

### Bear Case Fair Value
- P/E 10x on $14.00 EPS (lowered guidance) = $140
- If guidance cut to $13.50: FV = $135
- MoS at $130 = 7.1% (below threshold, but acceptable as averaging down)

---

## BASE SCENARIO (Probability: 60%)

### Triggers
- **EPS Inline**: Q4 EPS $3.35-$3.55 (within 3% of $3.44 consensus)
- **Premium Growth Stable**: Life premium +3-5% YoY
- **Margins Hold**: Combined ratio 83-86%
- **Guidance Maintained**: FY 2026 EPS $15.00-$15.50
- **No Litigation News**: No material class action update

### Why This Is Most Likely
1. Insurance is a predictable business (recurring premiums)
2. GL has been executing well post-short attack
3. Rates stable = investment income stable
4. Agent network growing steadily
5. Short-seller allegations cleared, business as usual

### Expected Market Reaction
- Price movement: -3% to +3% ($139-$148)
- P/E stable at 10-11x
- Market continues to wait for full re-rating

### Action if Base Scenario
| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Price stays $140-148 | **HOLD** - MoS still below 25% threshold |
| Price dips to $130 | **ADD** per standing order |
| Any sign of re-rating | **HOLD** - let it run |

### Base Case Fair Value (unchanged)
- Framework v2.0: $174
- MoS at $143.62 = 17.6%
- Status: HOLD - insufficient MoS for ADD

---

## BULL SCENARIO (Probability: 20%)

### Triggers
- **EPS Beat**: Q4 EPS > $3.60 (+5% vs consensus)
- **Premium Growth Accelerates**: Life premium +6% YoY
- **Margin Expansion**: Combined ratio < 82%
- **Guidance Raise**: FY 2026 EPS guidance > $15.75
- **Shareholder Return News**: Increased buyback, dividend raise
- **Litigation Resolution**: Class action dismissed or favorable settlement

### Why This Could Happen
1. Agent recruitment exceeded expectations
2. Pricing power stronger than expected (low inflation helps customers afford premiums)
3. Investment income beat (portfolio duration positioned well)
4. Market re-rates GL as Fuzzy Panda fears fully dissipate
5. Class action settles cheaply

### Expected Market Reaction
- Price increase: +10% to +20% ($158-$172)
- P/E expansion to 11-12x (toward peer median 14-15x)

### Action if Bull Scenario
| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Price rallies to $150-160 | **HOLD** - enjoy the ride, MoS compresses |
| Price rallies to $160-170 | **HOLD** - approaching FV, monitor |
| Price reaches $174 (FV) | **REVIEW** - consider trim 25% per investment rules |
| Price exceeds $180 | **TRIM 25%** - above FV, lock in gains |

### Bull Case Fair Value
- P/E 12x on $16.00 EPS (beat + guidance raise) = $192
- MoS at $174 (FV) = 0% - time to trim

---

## KILL CONDITIONS (Immediate Sell Regardless of Scenario)

The following conditions invalidate the thesis. Sell immediately without waiting:

1. **New Fraud Revelation**: Material fraud discovered beyond Fuzzy Panda allegations
2. **Regulatory Action**: New SEC/DOJ investigation opened
3. **Dividend Cut**: Any reduction in quarterly dividend (currently $0.27/share)
4. **ROE Collapse**: ROE guidance below 12% (vs 22% current)
5. **Class Action Material**: Settlement >$500M or reveals widespread fraud
6. **Operating EPS Collapse**: FY guidance below $12.00

**If any kill condition triggered: SELL ALL at market open next day.**
