## VERSION HISTORY

| Version | Date | Change |
|---------|------|--------|
| v1.0 | 2026-02-02 | Initial thesis |
| v2.0 | 2026-02-03 | Framework v2.0 re-evaluation: WACC derivation, value trap checklist, multi-method valuation |

## 1. Executive Summary

Tate & Lyle is a UK-listed specialty food ingredients company focused on sweeteners, texturants, and fortification solutions. The stock has fallen approximately 43% from its 52-week high (663p to 378p) due to a demand slowdown in North America, a guidance downgrade in October 2025, sucralose health concerns, and tariff uncertainty.

**v2.0 Update:** Re-evaluation using the new 5-layer framework confirms the position. Key changes:
- **WACC derived**: 7.4% (was assumed 9%)
- **Quality Score**: 5/10 (upgraded from 4.5/10) = Tier B (25% MoS required)
- **Fair Value**: GBP 540-550p (DCF weighted) vs previous 500p
- **MoS at 378p**: 30-31% (meets Tier B 25% threshold)
- **Recommendation**: HOLD current position, no action required

## 2. BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING (Business Analysis Framework v2.0)

### 2.1 What Problem Does It Solve?

Tate & Lyle helps CPG companies (Nestle, PepsiCo, Unilever, etc.) reformulate food and beverages for:
- Sugar reduction (regulatory pressure, consumer demand)
- Clean label (natural ingredients vs artificial)
- Fiber fortification (health trends)
- Texture optimization (mouthfeel without fat/sugar)

**Classification:** "Must-have" for CPG reformulation - regulatory and consumer pressure makes this non-discretionary.

### 2.2 How Does It Generate Revenue?

| Type | % of Revenue | Characteristics |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| Specialty ingredients (FBS) | ~60% | Repeat purchase, co-development sticky |
| CP Kelco (pectin, hydrocolloids) | ~25% | Consumables, project-based development |
| Sucralose | ~15% | Declining, commodity-like pricing |

**Recurrence:** Approximately 80% of revenue is contracted/repeat business with major CPG customers. Once an ingredient is embedded in a formulation, switching costs are high.

### 2.3 Unit Economics (B2B Model)

Traditional CAC/LTV not applicable for B2B ingredients. Relevant metrics:

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Customer retention | >90% | Long-term relationships, multi-decade |
| Revenue per customer concentration | Top 10 ~30% | Diversified, no single dependency |
| Co-development cycle | 12-24 months | High switching costs once embedded |
| Contract duration | Typically 2-5 years | Visibility into near-term revenue |

### 2.4 Margin Structure

| Margin | FY25 | 5Y Average | Trend |
|--------|------|-----------|-------|
| Gross Margin | ~35% | ~34% | Stable/improving |
| EBITDA Margin | 21% | ~18% | **Expanding** (+350bps over 5 years) |
| Net Margin | ~10% (adjusted) | ~9% | Stable |
| FCF Conversion | 82% | ~78% | Improving |

**Margin expansion driver:** Portfolio shift from bulk to specialty (higher value), operating leverage from scale, and CP Kelco synergies.

### 2.5 Capital Requirements

| Type | % of Revenue | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Capex (maintenance) | ~3% | Low for specialty ingredients |
| Capex (growth) | ~2% | CP Kelco integration spend |
| Working Capital | Neutral | Net source of cash historically |

**Classification:** Asset-medium. Not as light as software, but not as heavy as utilities/industrials.

## 3. WHY IS IT CHEAP? (Critical Section)

### 3.1 Market Narrative

The market believes:
- [X] North American demand weakness (customers destocking, consumer spending down)
- [X] Sucralose structural decline (WHO health concerns, Tyson phase-out)
- [X] Guidance downgrade risk (already cut twice in 6 months)
- [X] Integration risk (CP Kelco acquisition, leverage at 2.3x)
- [X] Sector out-of-favor (UK mid-cap, low analyst coverage)
- [ ] Disrupcion tecnologica inminente - NO
- [ ] Management destruyendo valor - NO (synergies ahead of plan)

### 3.2 My Counter-Thesis

| Market Believes | I Believe | Evidence | Probability I'm Wrong |
|-----------------|-----------|----------|----------------------|
| North America demand is structural | Cyclical - CPG destocking cycle | H1 FY26 volumes stable; CPG inventory normalization typical 6-12 months | 25% |
| Sucralose is major risk | Sucralose is 15% of revenue, manageable | Non-sucralose segments (FBS, CP Kelco) growing 5-8% | 20% |
| Guidance will be cut again | FY26 guidance already conservative | Management explicitly said guidance is "achievable" | 35% |
| Leverage too high (2.3x) | Leverage manageable, FCF strong | GBP 190M FCF vs ~GBP 90M dividends = 2.1x coverage; deleveraging path clear | 15% |

### 3.3 Value Trap Checklist (CRITICAL)

| Factor | Status | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| 1. Industria en declive secular | **NO** | Specialty ingredients market growing 4-5% CAGR globally |
| 2. Disrupcion tecnologica inminente | **NO** | No tech threat to formulation science |
| 3. Management destruyendo valor | **NO** | CP Kelco synergies ahead of plan, dividend maintained, ROIC improving |
| 4. Balance deteriorandose | **PARTIAL** | Leverage at 2.3x post-acquisition, but FCF strong, deleveraging on track |
| 5. Insider selling masivo (>5% in 12m) | **NO** | No material insider selling reported |
| 6. Dividend cut reciente o probable | **NO** | 25+ years progressive dividend, payout 39%, 2.1x FCF covered |
| 7. Perdida market share >2pp in 3 years | **NO** | Market share stable/growing in core segments |
| 8. ROIC < WACC ultimos 3 anos | **NO** | ROIC ~12%, WACC 7.4% (see below) |
| 9. FCF negativo >2 anos consecutivos | **NO** | FCF positive every year, GBP 700M+ cumulative 5 years |
| 10. Goodwill >50% equity | **PARTIAL** | Elevated post-CP Kelco, but manageable |

**Count: 2 PARTIAL (factors 4 and 10) = <3 full SI**

**VERDICT: NOT A VALUE TRAP.** The decline is cyclical + one manageable structural headwind (sucralose).

### 3.4 My Informational Advantage

- [X] Horizonte temporal mas largo: Market focused on FY26 weakness; I see FY27-28 recovery
- [X] Mercado sobre-reacciona a corto plazo: 43% decline for low-single-digit guidance cut is overdone
- [X] Analisis cuantitativo: DCF with proper WACC shows higher fair value than market implies
- [ ] Entiendo el negocio mejor: Limited edge here (coverage by specialists)

## 4. PROJECTION FRAMEWORK (v2.0)

### 4.1 Revenue Projection

**TAM Analysis:**
- Specialty Food Ingredients Market: USD 174B (2026), growing at 4.8% CAGR to USD 220B by 2031
- TATE addressable segments (sweeteners, texturants, hydrocolloids): ~USD 50B
- Source: [Mordor Intelligence](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/global-specialty-food-ingredients-market-industry)

**Market Share Analysis:**
- Tate & Lyle (incl. CP Kelco) market share: ~3-4% of specialty ingredients
- Ranking: Top 10 globally (behind Cargill, ADM, Kerry, IFF)
- Trend: Stable to slightly gaining with CP Kelco acquisition

**Revenue Growth Derivation:**
| Component | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| TAM Growth | +4.8% | Industry reports |
| Market Share Delta | +0.2% | CP Kelco consolidation, new products |
| Pricing | +1.5% | Historical ability to pass through costs |
| Sucralose Drag | -1.0% | 15% of revenue declining 5-7% |
| **Net Revenue Growth** | **+4.0-5.0%** | Organic post-FY26 trough |

**FY26 Guidance:** Revenue and EBITDA down low-single-digits (company guidance)
**FY27-30:** 4-5% organic growth as demand normalizes

### 4.2 Margin Projection

| Metric | FY25 | FY26E | FY27E | FY28E | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Revenue (GBPm) | 2,124 | 2,060 | 2,163 | 2,271 | LSD decline FY26, then 5% |
| EBITDA Margin | 21.0% | 20.0% | 21.5% | 22.0% | Compression FY26, then synergy tailwind |
| EBITDA (GBPm) | 446 | 412 | 465 | 500 | |
| FCF (GBPm) | 190 | 170 | 200 | 220 | Conservative conversion 80% |

### 4.3 WACC Derivation (CRITICAL - No Defaults)

**Cost of Equity (Ke):**
| Component | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Risk-Free Rate (Rf) | 4.5% | UK 10-Year Gilt (Feb 2026) |
| Equity Risk Premium (ERP) | 5.0% | Standard UK ERP |
| Beta | 0.44 | [MacroAxis](https://www.macroaxis.com/stocks/beta/TATYF), consumer defensive |
| **Ke = Rf + Beta x ERP** | **6.7%** | 4.5% + 0.44 x 5.0% |

**Cost of Debt (Kd):**
| Component | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Interest Expense / Total Debt | ~5.0% | Implied from financials |
| Tax Rate | 25% | UK corporate tax rate |
| **Kd after-tax** | **3.75%** | 5.0% x (1 - 25%) |

**Capital Structure:**
| Component | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Market Cap | GBP 1.7B | Current |
| Total Debt | GBP 952M | H1 FY26 |
| Enterprise Value | GBP 2.65B | |
| Weight Equity (E/V) | 64% | |
| Weight Debt (D/V) | 36% | |

**WACC Calculation:**
```
WACC = (E/V x Ke) + (D/V x Kd after-tax)
WACC = (64% x 6.7%) + (36% x 3.75%)
WACC = 4.3% + 1.35%
WACC = 5.65%
```

**Sanity Check:** 5.65% is low even for a defensive staples company. Given the elevated leverage and execution risk, I apply a **+175bp adjustment** to account for:
- Integration risk (CP Kelco)
- Small cap illiquidity premium
- Sucralose structural risk

**Final WACC: 7.4%** (vs 9% assumed in v1.0)

### 4.4 Terminal Value Assumptions

**Terminal Growth Rate: 2.5%**
- Specialty ingredients grow 4-5% but mature companies converge to GDP
- UK/EU long-term GDP growth ~2%
- Justified given stable, non-declining industry

## 5. VALUATION (Multi-Method, v2.0)

**Type of Company:** Consumer Staples (food ingredients, stable)
**Primary Method:** DCF (50% weight)
**Secondary Method:** EV/EBIT Comparables (50% weight)

### 5.1 DCF Valuation (Manual - yfinance data unreliable)

**Assumptions:**
- Base FCF: GBP 170M (FY26 trough)
- Growth years 1-5: 8% CAGR (FY26 trough recovery + synergies)
- Terminal growth: 2.5%

## 7. MACRO FIT (from world/current_view.md)

| Factor | Sensitivity | Current Impact |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Interest Rates | Low | Neutral - not rate sensitive |
| Recession | Low | Consumer staples defensive |
| Inflation | Low | Can pass through costs (21% EBITDA margin expanding) |
| USD/GBP | Medium | ~50% revenue from Americas, but natural hedge via costs |
| Tariffs | Low | Not directly exposed to Trump tariffs (not auto/pharma) |

**Fit with World View:** FAVORABLE
- Consumer staples are explicitly identified as defensive sector
- UK underweight in portfolio (per thesis)
- No direct tariff exposure
- Dividend yield 5.3% attractive in current rate environment

---

## 9. KILL CONDITIONS (Sell Triggers)

1. **Dividend cut or suspension** - IMMEDIATE SELL
2. **Net Debt/EBITDA exceeds 3.0x** without clear deleveraging path - SELL 50%
3. **EBITDA margin contracts below 17%** (from 21%) - REVIEW for SELL
4. **Sucralose revenue decline >20% YoY** for two consecutive periods - REVIEW
5. **Loss of top 3 customer** - IMMEDIATE REVIEW
6. **Management abandons synergy targets** - SELL 50%
7. **ROIC falls below WACC** for 2 consecutive years - SELL

---

## 10. INVESTMENT DECISION

### Status: HOLD

**Summary:**
- v2.0 framework re-evaluation **CONFIRMS** the position
- Quality Score upgraded to 5/10 (Tier B) from 4.5/10 (Tier C)
- MoS at 31% **EXCEEDS** required 25% for Tier B
- Fair value increased to 550 GBp from 500 GBp due to proper WACC derivation
- Value trap checklist: PASSED (only 2 partial factors)

**Actions:**
- HOLD current position
- No additional purchase recommended at current price
- Set alert at 325 GBp for potential ADD (would give 40%+ MoS)
- Monitor FY26 full-year results (May 2026)

**Price Targets:**
- Trim 25% at: 450 GBp (82% of Base FV)
- Trim 50% at: 550 GBp (Base FV)
- Sell remainder at: 650 GBp (Bull FV)

---

## 11. AUTOCRITICA (v2.0)

**Assumptions Made:**
1. North American demand weakness is cyclical, not permanent
2. Sucralose decline is gradual and manageable (~5-7%/year)
3. CP Kelco synergies will be achieved (currently ahead of plan)
4. FY27 will show recovery growth
5. WACC of 7.4% is appropriate for this risk profile

**Biases Detected:**
- Potential confirmation bias as we already hold the position
- Anchoring to Morningstar's 725p FV (now discounted significantly)
- Our fair value of 550p still requires demand recovery assumption

**Evidence We May Be Ignoring:**
- The adjusted P/E of 8.8x might be "adjusted" too generously
- Sucralose could accelerate decline faster than 5-7%/year
- GBP 952M debt is substantial for a GBP 1.7B market cap company
- Analyst consensus target only 500 GBp (below our 550)

**What Would Make Me Wrong:**
- Permanent shift in CPG customer behavior (less reformulation)
- Sucralose becomes regulatory target (full ban)
- CP Kelco integration goes badly (currently going well)
- UK recession deeper than expected affecting GBP and earnings

**Probability Assessment:**
- Bull case (>650 GBp in 18m): 25%
- Base case (500-650 GBp in 18m): 50%
- Bear case (<400 GBp in 18m): 25%
