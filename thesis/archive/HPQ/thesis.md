# HP Inc. (HPQ) - Investment Thesis v2.0

**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Analyst:** Claude (Fundamental Analyst)
**Framework Version:** v2.0 (business-analysis, projection, multi-method valuation)
**Status:** REJECTED - Value trap. Secular decline + no moat + negative equity + insider selling. MoS insufficient for Tier C requirements.
**Previous Status:** REJECTED (2026-02-02) - Same conclusion, now with v2.0 framework applied

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

HP Inc. is a $17.2B market cap PC and printing hardware company. The stock has fallen 45% from its 52-week high of $35.28 to $18.43 and appears statistically cheap at 7.0x P/E with 6.1% dividend yield.

**However, applying the v2.0 framework reveals this is a VALUE TRAP:**

1. **No moat**: PCs are commoditized. Printing has weak switching costs eroding as volumes decline.
2. **Secular decline**: Printing (25% of revenue but 60%+ of operating income) declining 4-5% annually with hardware units down 12%. Digital transformation accelerating.
3. **Negative equity**: $9.6B debt, negative shareholder equity from aggressive buybacks. No cushion.
4. **Insider selling heavy**: CEO sold 22% of position in Dec 2025. 350% increase in insider selling.
5. **CEO departure**: Enrique Lores left for PayPal CEO role Feb 2026. Leadership vacuum.
6. **Tariff exposure**: Current guidance already incorporates tariff costs; further escalation is risk.

**Value Trap Checklist: 4/10 factors SI = PROBABLE VALUE TRAP**

Fair value under conservative multi-method valuation: $21-24. At $18.43, MoS is only 12-23%, insufficient for Tier C requirement of 35%.

**RECOMMENDATION: ELIMINATE STANDING ORDER at $18.50. Do not buy.**

## 1. BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING (Framework Completo)

### 1.1 What Problem Does HP Solve?

**For PC segment (75% revenue):**
- Provides computing hardware (laptops, desktops, workstations) for enterprises and consumers
- "Must-have" for businesses, "nice-to-have" for consumers
- Problem: Commoditized market. HP offers no unique solution vs Lenovo, Dell, Acer.

**For Print segment (25% revenue, ~60% operating profit):**
- Provides printing hardware and supplies (ink/toner)
- "Decreasing necessity" - digital workflows replacing physical documents
- Razor/blade model: cheap printers, expensive ink. This model is ERODING.

### 1.2 Revenue Model

| Segment | Revenue Type | Characteristics |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Personal Systems | Transaction (hardware) | One-time, low margin (5-7% OPM) |
| Printing Hardware | Transaction | One-time, DECLINING 12% units |
| Printing Supplies | Consumables | Repeat purchase, HIGH margin (18.9% segment OPM), but DECLINING |

**Recurring revenue**: Printing supplies + HP Instant Ink subscriptions. But supplies revenue declining 4% annually as installed base shrinks.

### 1.3 Unit Economics

**PC Segment:**
- Operating margin: 5.8% (thin)
- No meaningful switching costs
- Replacement cycle: 4-5 years
- AI PCs provide temporary ASP uplift but no structural advantage

**Printing Segment:**
- Operating margin: 18.9% (the profit engine)
- LTV/CAC: High historically (cheap printer + years of ink purchases)
- **PROBLEM**: LTV declining as printing volumes fall, digital adoption rises
- Churn: Users printing less, switching to digital, or buying third-party ink

### 1.4 Margin Structure and Trend

| Metric | FY2023 | FY2024 | FY2025 | Trend |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Gross Margin | 19.8% | 20.1% | 19.5% | Flat/Slight decline |
| Operating Margin | 7.8% | 8.1% | 7.5% | Slight decline |
| Net Margin | 5.8% | 6.0% | 5.5% | Slight decline |
| FCF Conversion | 110%+ | 100%+ | 95%+ | Declining |

**Memory cost headwind**: Management guided $0.30 EPS headwind from DRAM/NAND in FY26. PC margins already thin.

### 1.5 Capital Requirements

- **Capex**: ~$500M/year (~1% of revenue) - relatively asset-light
- **Working capital**: Negative WC (good cash conversion)
- **Debt service**: $9.6B debt, interest coverage 10.7x (currently adequate)

## 2. WHY IS IT CHEAP? (Critical Analysis)

### 2.1 Market Narrative

The market believes:
1. [X] **Secular decline in printing** - digital transformation accelerating
2. [X] **PC commoditization** - no differentiation vs Lenovo/Dell
3. [X] **Memory cost inflation** - squeezes already-thin PC margins
4. [X] **Tariff exposure** - US tariffs add cost pressure
5. [X] **CEO departure** - Lores left for PayPal, leadership vacuum
6. [X] **Insider selling** - CEO sold 22% of position before leaving
7. [ ] Governance issues - not material currently
8. [ ] Balance sheet crisis - not yet, but negative equity is warning

### 2.2 My Contra-Thesis (What I Would Need to Believe)

| Market Believes | I Would Need to Believe | My Assessment |
|-----------------|------------------------|---------------|
| Printing in permanent decline | Printing stabilizes at -2% | UNLIKELY - China printing down 12%, global digital adoption accelerating |
| PCs are commoditized | AI PCs create differentiation | UNLIKELY - AI is software, not hardware. No sustainable moat. |
| Memory costs hurt margins | Memory costs normalize | POSSIBLE but timing unknown |
| Insider selling = red flag | Selling is routine/tax-driven | UNLIKELY - 22% position reduction + CEO departure = real signal |
| Leadership vacuum | New CEO executes well | UNKNOWN - interim CEO, permanent search ongoing |

**Honest assessment**: I cannot construct a compelling contra-thesis. The market is RIGHT to be concerned.

### 2.3 Value Trap Checklist

| Factor | Status | Comment |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Industria en declive secular | **SI** | Printing declining structurally 4-5% annually |
| Disrupcion tecnologica inminente | **SI** | Digital transformation killing print demand |
| Management destruyendo valor | NO | Capital allocation reasonable (dividends + buybacks) |
| Balance deteriorandose | **SI** | Negative equity, $9.6B debt |
| Insider selling masivo >5% en 12m | **SI** | CEO sold 22%, 350% increase in selling activity |
| Dividend cut reciente o probable | NO | Payout 43%, covered by FCF |
| Perdida market share >2pp en 3 anos | NO | Holding share in both segments |
| ROIC < WACC ultimos 3 anos | NO | ROIC 15-17% > WACC ~10% |
| FCF negativo >2 anos consecutivos | NO | FCF $2.9B positive |
| Goodwill >50% equity | N/A | Negative equity |

**COUNT: 4/10 SI = PROBABLE VALUE TRAP**

Per investment-rules skill: >3 factors SI = REJECT or Tier C (35% MoS minimum)

### 2.4 My Informational Advantage

**NONE**. I have no edge here:
- I cannot predict when/if printing decline accelerates
- I cannot predict memory cost trajectory
- I have no insight into new CEO quality
- The market sees all the same data I see

**WARNING**: When I have no informational advantage, the market is probably right.

## 3. PROJECTION FRAMEWORK (Fundamentada)

### 3.1 TAM Analysis

**PC Market TAM:**
- 2025: $222.6B (IDC, Mordor Intelligence)
- Growth rate: 3-4% (units), 9% CAGR (value) through 2031
- Drivers: AI PC refresh, Windows 11 migration
- HP market share: 22.6% (stable, #2 behind Lenovo)

**Printing Market TAM:**
- 2025: ~$55B (hardware + supplies)
- Growth rate: **NEGATIVE** - hardware declining 5-12%, supplies 3-4%
- Digital printing growing but HP weak in that segment
- HP market share: 34.4% (#1, but in shrinking market)

### 3.2 Revenue Projection

**PC Segment (75% of revenue):**
```
TAM growth: +3%
Market share change: 0% (stable)
Pricing power: 0% (commoditized, AI premium temporary)
= Revenue growth: +3%
```

**Printing Segment (25% of revenue):**
```
TAM growth: -4% (structural decline)
Market share change: 0%
Pricing power: -1% (competition, third-party ink)
= Revenue growth: -5%
```

**Blended Revenue Growth:**
- Base case: +1% (PC +3%, Print -5%, weighted)
- Bear case: -2% (PC flat, Print -8%)
- Bull case: +3% (PC +5% AI refresh, Print -3% stabilization)

### 3.3 Margin Projection

| Scenario | Operating Margin | Rationale |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Base | 7.0% | Current 7.5%, slight pressure from memory costs |
| Bear | 6.0% | Memory inflation + tariffs + Print accelerates decline |
| Bull | 8.0% | Memory normalizes + cost savings kick in |

### 3.4 WACC Derivation (NOT DEFAULT)

```
Risk-Free Rate (10Y Treasury): 4.22%
Equity Risk Premium: 5.0%
Beta: 1.23
Cost of Equity (Ke) = 4.22% + (1.23 x 5.0%) = 10.4%

Cost of Debt (Kd pre-tax): 5.5% (estimated from interest/debt)
Tax Rate: 18%
Kd after-tax = 5.5% x (1 - 0.18) = 4.5%

Market Cap: $17.2B
Total Debt: $9.6B
Enterprise Value: $26.8B (approx)

Weight Equity (E/V): 64%
Weight Debt (D/V): 36%

WACC = (64% x 10.4%) + (36% x 4.5%) = 6.7% + 1.6% = 8.3%

Sanity check: 8.3% is LOW for a company with:
- Negative equity (higher risk)
- Secular decline in key segment
- High beta (1.23)
- Insider selling

ADJUSTED WACC: 10.0% (add 1.7% risk premium for above factors)
```

### 3.5 Terminal Growth

- PC market: GDP-ish (~2%)
- Printing market: **NEGATIVE** (-2% or worse)
- Blended terminal: **1.0%** (being generous)

For a company with secular decline in its most profitable segment, terminal growth should arguably be 0%.

## 4. VALUATION (Multi-Method)

### Method 1: DCF (Tool Output)

```bash
python3 tools/dcf_calculator.py HPQ --scenarios
```

| Scenario | FV/Share | MoS vs $18.43 |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Bear | $34.75 | +88% |
| Base | $45.71 | +148% |
| Bull | $61.26 | +232% |

**DCF CAVEAT**: These values are unrealistically high because:
1. Tool uses historical FCF growth which overstates HP's future
2. Does not account for secular printing decline
3. WACC in tool may be lower than my calculated 10%

**DCF is NOT reliable for HPQ** - company is not stable growth.

### Method 2: EV/EBIT Multiple (PRIMARY for hardware)

**EBIT Calculation:**
- FY25 Operating Income: ~$4.1B
- 5-year normalized EBIT: ~$4.0B

**Multiple Selection:**
- Sector range (mature tech hardware): 8-12x
- HP deserves LOW END because:
  - No moat (-2x)
  - Secular decline in print (-2x)
  - Negative equity (-1x)
- **Selected multiple: 7-8x** (below sector)

**Valuation:**
```
EV = EBIT x Multiple
EV (Bear) = $4.0B x 7x = $28.0B
EV (Base) = $4.0B x 7.5x = $30.0B
EV (Bull) = $4.0B x 8x = $32.0B

Equity Value = EV - Net Debt
Net Debt = $7.2B

Equity (Bear) = $28.0B - $7.2B = $20.8B -> $22.20/share
Equity (Base) = $30.0B - $7.2B = $22.8B -> $24.35/share
Equity (Bull) = $32.0B - $7.2B = $24.8B -> $26.50/share
```

### Method 3: P/E Multiple

**EPS:**
- FY26 guidance (non-GAAP): $2.90-$3.20 (midpoint $3.05)
- BUT this excludes $650M restructuring charges
- GAAP EPS likely $2.50-$2.70

**Multiple Selection:**
- Current: 7x (market price)
- Reasonable for declining business: 7-9x
- Premium for cash return: +1x
- Discount for decline: -1x
- **Selected: 7-8x** forward non-GAAP

**Valuation:**
```
Bear: 7x x $2.90 = $20.30
Base: 7.5x x $3.05 = $22.88
Bull: 8x x $3.20 = $25.60
```

### Method Reconciliation

| Method | Bear | Base | Bull | Weight |
|--------|------|------|------|--------|
| EV/EBIT | $22.20 | $24.35 | $26.50 | 50% |
| P/E | $20.30 | $22.88 | $25.60 | 50% |
| DCF | $34.75 | $45.71 | $61.26 | 0% (unreliable) |
| **Weighted** | **$21.25** | **$23.62** | **$26.05** | 100% |

**Fair Value Range: $21-24 (midpoint $23)**

### Margin of Safety Calculation

```
Price: $18.43
Fair Value Base: $23.62
MoS vs Base: 22%

Expected Value = (Bear x 25%) + (Base x 50%) + (Bull x 25%)
EV = ($21.25 x 0.25) + ($23.62 x 0.50) + ($26.05 x 0.25)
EV = $5.31 + $11.81 + $6.51 = $23.63

MoS vs Expected Value: 22%
MoS vs Bear: 13%
```

**INSUFFICIENT for Tier C requirement (35%)**

---

## 5. ESCENARIOS

### Bear Case (25% probability)
**Assumptions:**
- Recession hits PC demand (-10%)
- Printing decline accelerates to -8%
- Memory costs stay elevated
- New CEO stumbles
- Multiple contracts to 6x

**Fair Value: $21.25**
**Downside from current: -15% ($15.67)**

### Base Case (50% probability)
**Assumptions:**
- PC grows 3% on AI refresh
- Printing decline stable at -5%
- Cost savings offset some pressure
- Interim CEO stabilizes

**Fair Value: $23.62**
**Upside from current: +28%**

### Bull Case (25% probability)
**Assumptions:**
- AI PC cycle beats expectations
- Printing stabilizes at -3%
- $1B cost savings flows to bottom line
- Market re-rates on FCF durability

**Fair Value: $26.05**
**Upside from current: +41%**

## 6. MOAT ASSESSMENT

### Moat Rating: NONE to NARROW (eroding)

| Factor | Score | Evidence |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Brand | 4/10 | Known but not premium, no pricing power |
| Scale | 6/10 | #2 PC, #1 Print, but scale doesn't prevent decline |
| Switching costs | 3/10 | Low in PCs; moderate in enterprise print but eroding |
| Network effects | 1/10 | None |
| Cost advantage | 5/10 | Scale-driven but no unique advantage vs Lenovo |
| Intangibles | 3/10 | Some patents but no blocking IP |

**ROIC vs WACC (10+ years required for Wide Moat):**
- ROIC: 15-17% historically
- WACC: ~10%
- ROIC > WACC = YES, but declining and driven by buybacks reducing capital base

**Moat Conclusion**: Narrow moat at best, eroding due to printing secular decline and PC commoditization. Does NOT qualify for Tier A or B.

---

## 7. RISK ASSESSMENT

### Kill Conditions (Would force immediate sale)

1. **Dividend cut** - signals FCF deterioration
2. **FCF drops below $2B** - covenant and return risk
3. **Printing decline accelerates to >8%** annually
4. **Margin compression to <5%** operating margin
5. **Debt covenant breach** or downgrade to junk

### Risk Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Printing secular decline accelerates | HIGH (60%) | HIGH | None - structural |
| Memory cost inflation | MEDIUM (40%) | MEDIUM | Cost savings program |
| CEO transition disruption | MEDIUM (50%) | MEDIUM | Interim CEO appointed |
| Tariff escalation | MEDIUM (40%) | MEDIUM | Guidance already includes |
| Recession | LOW-MEDIUM (25%) | HIGH | Thin margins, no cushion |
| Balance sheet stress | LOW (15%) | HIGH | Interest coverage adequate now |

---

## 8. MACRO CONNECTION

### Current World View (2026-02-02)
- Fed/BCE on hold (types estables)
- Geopolitica CALIENTE (Iran-US, tariffs escalating)
- Sector Tech Hardware: EVITAR (exposed to tariffs, commodity)
- Entorno neutral-negativo para ciclicas

### HPQ Macro Sensitivity

| Factor | Sensitivity | Current Impact |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Interest rates | MEDIUM | Higher rates = lower multiples |
| Recession | HIGH | PC/Print demand highly cyclical |
| Tariffs | HIGH | US tariffs add cost, China trade war risk |
| USD strength | MEDIUM | 65% international revenue |
| Commodity (oil) | LOW | Not direct exposure |

**Macro Fit: POOR**
- Late-cycle concerns (recession risk 25-35%)
- Tariff escalation ongoing
- Not a sector where world view suggests opportunity

## 9. QUALITY SCORE

| # | Criterion | Score | Notes |
|---|-----------|-------|-------|
| 1 | ROE >15% (5yr) | 0 | Negative equity makes ROE meaningless |
| 2 | FCF positive every year (5yr) | 1 | Yes, $2.4-3.4B consistently |
| 3 | Debt/Equity <1.0 | 0 | Negative equity |
| 4 | Dividend 10+ years no cut | 1 | Since 2000, 11+ years |
| 5 | Wide moat | 0 | No moat (narrow at best) |
| 6 | Revenue stability (max -15% drawdown) | 1 | Revenue relatively stable |
| 7 | Management quality | 0 | CEO just left, interim in place |
| 8 | Analyst coverage >10 | 1 | 17 analysts |
| 9 | Market cap >EUR 10B | 1 | EUR 14.5B |
| 10 | Defensive sector | 0 | Technology/cyclical |
| **Total** | **5/10** | **Tier C (35% MoS required)** |

## 10. INVESTMENT COMMITTEE GATES

| Gate | Status | Comment |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1. Business understanding | PASS | Completed business analysis framework |
| 2. Projection fundamentada | PASS | TAM/share/pricing derived, WACC calculated |
| 3. Valoracion multi-metodo | PASS | EV/EBIT + P/E (DCF excluded as unreliable) |
| 4. Margen de seguridad | **FAIL** | 22% MoS vs 35% required for Tier C |
| 5. Contexto macro | **FAIL** | Tech hardware in tariff crosshairs |
| 6. Portfolio fit | N/A | Not buying |
| 7. Autocritica explicita | PASS | See below |

**GATES FAILED: 2/6 (excluding N/A)**

**DECISION: REJECT**

---

## 11. AUTOCRITICA

### Assumptions Made
- FY26 EPS midpoint $3.05 is achievable
- Printing decline stays at -5% (not accelerating)
- Memory costs don't worsen beyond guidance
- New CEO at least maintains status quo

### Biases I Might Have
1. **Anchoring on cheap metrics**: 7x P/E looks irresistible but printing is dying
2. **Confirmation bias**: Looking for reasons to buy because of statistical cheapness
3. **Overconfidence in "cash cow"**: IBM was also a cash cow that decayed

### Evidence I'm Ignoring
- Printing hardware units down 12% is LEADING indicator of supplies decline
- China printing market down 12.5% - HP has significant China exposure
- Insider selling at unprecedented levels - they know more than me
- CEO left for another job - if HP was great, why leave?

### What Would Buffett Say?
"HP has no durable competitive advantage. PCs are commodities and printing is in secular decline. The FCF yield looks attractive but the underlying business is eroding. I would need a much wider margin of safety - at least 40-50% - to compensate for the uncertainty. At current prices, I would pass."

### What Am I Missing?
- **Upside scenario I'm underweighting**: AI PCs could drive unexpected refresh demand
- **But**: AI is software value, not hardware. No moat.

---

## 12. DECISION

### RECOMMENDATION: **REJECT - ELIMINATE STANDING ORDER**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Fair Value (base) | $23.62 |
| Current Price | $18.43 |
| Margin of Safety | 22% |
| Required MoS (Tier C) | 35% |
| MoS Met? | **NO** |
| Quality Score | 5/10 (Tier C) |
| Value Trap Score | 4/10 SI (PROBABLE TRAP) |
| Macro Fit | Poor |

### Price at Which I Would Buy

For Tier C (35% MoS): $23.62 x 0.65 = **$15.35**

Standing order at $18.50 is INSUFFICIENT. Even at current $18.43, MoS is only 22%.

### Actions
1. **ELIMINATE standing order at $18.50**
2. **Move thesis to archive** (not watchlist - no interest at any realistic price)
3. **Do NOT monitor** - opportunity cost of attention
