## URGENT RE-EVALUATION: THREE NEGATIVE EVENTS (Feb 2026)

### Event 1: Amlitelimab Phase III -- Mixed/Disappointing

**COAST 1 (Sept 2025):** Met all endpoints but efficacy weaker than expected.
- EASI-75: 35.9% (Q4W) and 39.1% (Q12W) vs 20.9% placebo
- Significantly below Phase IIb data (~39% over placebo)
- Stock fell 10% (~$13B wiped)

**COAST 2 (Jan 2026):** Mixed -- met US primary endpoint, FAILED EU co-primary endpoint.
- Amlitelimab did NOT achieve statistical significance for EU reference countries
- Confirmed as second-line therapy, not Dupixent replacement

**SHORE (Jan 2026):** Met both primary endpoints (combined with topical therapies).

**Critical: Amlitelimab efficacy INFERIOR to Dupixent.**
- Dupixent achieves EASI-75 of 44-52% in 16 weeks
- Amlitelimab: 35-39% in 24 weeks
- Only advantage: less frequent dosing (Q12W vs Q2W)
- William Blair: "OX40 therapies do not drive deep responses as fast as IL-13/4 class"

**Impact on thesis:** Amlitelimab was thesis's "lead pipeline asset" for post-Dupixent era. It WILL NOT replace Dupixent's revenue or efficacy. This narrows pipeline replacement significantly.

### Event 2: UBS Downgrade (Jan 16, 2026)

- Downgraded from Buy to Neutral, PT cut EUR 105 to EUR 88
- 2026 EPS estimate: EUR 7.79 (from 8.05, -3.2%)
- 2027 EPS estimate: EUR 8.28 (from 8.85, -6.4%)
- Core OI CAGR 2025-2030: 7.8% (from 9.5%)
- Buyback assumptions halved: EUR 3B (from >EUR 6B) due to M&A needs
- UBS: "little scope for re-rating due to persistent R&D productivity concerns"
- UBS: "large-scale M&A may now be the only realistic solution"

### Event 3: CFO Admitted Dupixent Gap

CFO Francois-Xavier Roger: Dupixent loss of exclusivity impact "is too big to be mitigated" through internal pipeline alone. Relying on:
1. Products already on market
2. Pipeline through 2031
3. **External acquisitions (EUR 14-15B M&A budget)**

This shifts the investment thesis from "pipeline replaces Dupixent" to "M&A execution must fill the gap" -- introducing significant execution risk, overpayment risk, and integration risk.

## PIPELINE FAILURE RATE ASSESSMENT

| Drug | Indication | Result | Impact |
|------|-----------|--------|--------|
| Tolebrutinib | PPMS (Phase 3) | FAILED | HIGH -- $1.8B impairment |
| Tolebrutinib | nrSPMS | FDA CRL (rejected) | HIGH -- MS franchise at risk |
| Amlitelimab | AD COAST 2 EU | EU primary endpoint FAILED | MEDIUM |
| Amlitelimab | Asthma (Phase 2) | FAILED | MEDIUM |

**Successes:** Amlitelimab AD COAST 1 (weak), COAST 2 US, SHORE; Itepekimab AERIFY-1; Dupixent new indications.

**Failure rate: ~50-55% on material pipeline events.**
Kill condition #5 threshold: 60%. Status: APPROACHING but not triggered.

## REVISED VALUATION (2026-02-09)

### Changes from v2.0:
1. FCF growth reduced: 4% Y1-5 (was 6%), 2% Y6-10 (was 3%)
2. DDM dividend growth: 3.5% (was 4-4.5%) -- buybacks halved, M&A capital needs
3. WACC increased: 8.5% (was 8%) -- higher risk from pipeline uncertainty

### Method 1: DCF (40% weight)

DCF tool scenarios (default parameters):
- Bear: EUR 57.55
- Base: EUR 75.08
- Bull: EUR 99.91

### Method 2: DDM (60% weight)

Gordon Growth Model with revised inputs:
- D1 = EUR 3.92 x 1.035 = EUR 4.06
- Bear (r=9%, g=3%): EUR 67.27
- Base (r=8.5%, g=3.5%): EUR 81.10
- Bull (r=8%, g=4%): EUR 101.92

### Combined Valuation (DCF 40% + DDM 60%)

| Scenario | DCF FV | DDM FV | Combined FV | MoS |
|----------|--------|--------|-------------|-----|
| Bear | EUR 57.55 | EUR 67.27 | **EUR 63.38** | -21.1% |
| Base | EUR 75.08 | EUR 81.10 | **EUR 78.69** | -2.0% |
| Bull | EUR 99.91 | EUR 101.92 | **EUR 101.12** | +25.9% |

Adjusted central FV (weighting my estimate with UBS EUR 88): **~EUR 83**
MoS at EUR 80.29 vs EUR 83: **+3.3%** (essentially zero safety)

### Comparison: v2.0 vs v3.0

| Metric | v2.0 Thesis | v3.0 Revised | Delta |
|--------|------------|--------------|-------|
| Base FV | EUR 122.02 | EUR 78.69 | **-35.5%** |
| Bear FV | EUR 97.90 | EUR 63.38 | **-35.3%** |
| MoS Base | +34.1% | -2.0% | **-36pp** |

## EXIT PROTOCOL (6 Gates)

| Gate | Result | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| Gate 1: Kill Condition | NO | Not formally triggered (approaching on #5) |
| Gate 2: Thesis Valid | **DEBILITADA** | Pipeline replacement failed, M&A dependent |
| Gate 3: MoS Current | **~0%** | No margin of safety for Tier B |
| Gate 4: Opportunity Score | **18.9 vs NVO** | Extreme improvement available |
| Gate 5: Dead Money | N/A | Only 9 days held |
| Gate 6: Friction | **<0.5%** | Liquid stock, minimal gain, no tax impact |

**EXIT Protocol Result: 4/6 gates support SELL.**

## DECISION: SELL

### Conviction: MEDIUM-HIGH

### Reasoning from Principles:

**Principio 5 (QS as Input):** QS 55-59 at low Tier B, ROIC < WACC confirmed. This is a red flag we have consistently acted on.

**Principio 6 (Sell Requires Argument):** The argument is:
1. ROIC < WACC (-2.1pp) -- pattern: every portfolio position with this signal was sold (TEP.PA, LIGHT.AS, PFE, A2A.MI, VNA.DE, TATE.L, SHEL.L)
2. MoS revised to approximately 0% -- insufficient for Tier B with mounting pipeline risk
3. Thesis materially weakened: CFO admits internal pipeline cannot replace Dupixent; M&A is the only path
4. 6 superior Tier A alternatives already in portfolio (NVO itself is Tier A pharma with MoS 38%)

**Principio 7 (Consistency):** Consistent with every ROIC < WACC precedent. Deviating here would require a strong argument for why SAN.PA is different. The only argument is "Dupixent still has 5-7 years" -- but that is already priced in at P/E 19.8x.

**Principio 9 (Quality Gravitation):** SAN.PA at QS 55-59 is the lowest-quality position outside of legacy Tier C/probation holdings. NVO (QS 82) is already in portfolio as our pharma exposure. SAN.PA does not earn its place.

### Precedents Consulted:
- PFE SELL (QS 47, MoS -3.2%, ROIC < WACC) -- similar pharma position, sold
- A2A.MI SELL (ROIC -3.0pp, thesis FV inflated 24%) -- same ROIC pattern
- VNA.DE SELL (ROIC -6.6pp, MoS near zero) -- same pattern
- Pattern: 7/7 positions with ROIC < WACC were sold

### Action: Recommend FULL EXIT
- Capital freed: ~EUR 430
- Hold as cash (portfolio already at ~25% cash) or deploy to ADD Tier A position
- No standing orders near trigger currently; cash is appropriate given context

## AUTOCRITICA

**Assumptions in this re-evaluation:**
- ROIC < WACC from tool may be distorted by pharma goodwill/intangibles
- My revised FV (EUR 78.69) is below analyst consensus (EUR 99) by ~20%
- If amlitelimab gets approved and captures even 10% of AD market, it could add EUR 2-3B revenue by 2030

**Biases Detected:**
- May be anchoring to the ROIC < WACC pattern too rigidly for pharma
- Adversarial review program may have created systematic pessimism bias

**Counter-argument I take seriously:**
- Dupixent itself is still a phenomenal franchise growing +32% YoY
- The dividend at 4.9% provides downside protection
- At EUR 80, the stock has already priced in significant pessimism
- 17/25 analysts rate it Buy

**Why I still recommend SELL:**
- The ROIC < WACC signal has been our most reliable exit indicator
- The MoS has evaporated from 34% to ~0%
- We have NVO as our pharma Tier A exposure
- The opportunity cost of holding SAN.PA when NVO offers MoS 38% is quantifiable
