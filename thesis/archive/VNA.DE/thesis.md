## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Recommendation: HOLD (was BUY)**
**Quality Score: 5/10 = Tier B (Cyclical) = MoS required >= 25%**
**ADVERSARIAL CORRECTION:** quality_scorer.py shows QS=41 (Tier C), NOT Tier B

Vonovia is Europe's largest residential REIT (548K+ apartments, primarily Germany). Trading at EUR 24.37 vs Fair Value EUR 32.58 (blended NAV/DDM) = **25.2% MoS**. This is marginally acceptable for Tier B.
