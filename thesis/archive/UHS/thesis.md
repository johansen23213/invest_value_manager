## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

| Metric | v2.0 (Feb 3) | Adversarial (Feb 7) | v3.0 (Feb 10) | Change vs Adversarial |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Price at analysis | $201.86 | $218.56 | $212.94 | -2.6% |
| Fair Value | $283.74 | $243 | $213 | -12.3% |
| MoS | 28.8% | ~10% | ~0% | -10pp |
| QS (Tool) | 7/10 custom | 51 Tier C | 51 Tier C | Confirmed |
| ROIC-WACC spread | 1.66pp | 1.2pp | 1.2pp | Confirmed |
| Conviction | HOLD | LOW | LOW | Confirmed |

**FV Bridge from Adversarial ($243 to $213):**
| Factor | Impact | New Info |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Medicaid cuts NOW LAW (OBBBA Jul 2025) | -$18 | $360-400M revenue loss by 2032, 60% behavioral |
| DOJ/OIG 5yr oversight quantified | -$8 | $122M settlement + compliance costs + billing constraints |
| Behavioral health volume softness confirmed | -$6 | Q1 decline, Q2 +0.4%, Q3 +0.5% — not accelerating |
| Q3 2025 EPS beat & guidance raise | +$5 | EPS $5.69 (+53.4%), FY guide $21.50-22.10 |
| Multiple compression (Medicaid risk) | -$3 | Cantor/Baird downgrades, sector re-rating |
| **Net** | **-$30** | |

**Key v3.0 Changes:**
1. **MEDICAID CUTS ARE LAW** — One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed Jul 4, 2025. $1T in Medicaid cuts over 10 years. 11.8M lose coverage. UHS receives $1.2B/yr supplemental Medicaid benefits, expected to lose $360-400M by 2032. This is the single biggest forward risk.
2. **DOJ/OIG oversight fully integrated** — $122M False Claims Act settlement + 5-year Corporate Integrity Agreement constrains behavioral health operations (44% of revenue).
3. **Behavioral health volumes soft** — Q1 2025 declined, Q2 +0.4%, Q3 +0.5%. NOT the 7-9% CAGR the thesis projected. Volume growth is muted.
4. **DCF deprioritized** — FCF CV=2.3 makes DCF unreliable. Weight shifted to EV/EBITDA + P/E.
5. **FV $213** = essentially NO margin of safety at $212.94.

## 1. BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

### 1.1 Business Model

UHS operates 28 acute care hospitals and 331 behavioral health facilities across the US, UK, and Puerto Rico. Third-largest US hospital operator by revenue (~$15.8B FY2025E).

**Revenue Model:**
| Segment | % Revenue | Model | Key Metric |
|---------|-----------|-------|------------|
| Acute Care | 56% | Fee-for-service (per admission/procedure) | Revenue per adjusted admission |
| Behavioral Health | 44% | Fee-for-service (per patient day) | Revenue per patient day, occupancy |

**Payer Mix:**
| Payer | % Revenue | Trend | Risk |
|-------|-----------|-------|------|
| Commercial | ~40% | Stable | Low — employer-sponsored, ACA marketplace |
| Medicare | ~25% | Growing (aging population) | Medium — CMS rate updates, bundled payments |
| Medicaid | ~25% | **AT RISK** | **HIGH — OBBBA $1T cuts, 11.8M lose coverage** |
| Self-pay/Other | ~10% | Stable | Medium — bad debt risk |

### 1.2 Unit Economics (Updated)

```
Acute Care:
  Revenue per Adjusted Admission: ~$15,000-17,000 (up from $14-16K, pricing driven)
  Operating Profit per Admission: ~$1,500-2,000
  Occupancy: 55-65% (below optimal 70%+)

Behavioral Health:
  Revenue per Patient Day: ~$1,100-1,300
  Profit per Patient Day: ~$100-200
  Occupancy: 75-85% (near optimal)

Key: Operating leverage exists — incremental admission is highly profitable
     above breakeven. But labor costs (55-60% of revenue) limit margin expansion.
```

### 1.3 Margin Structure (Updated with Q3 2025)

| Margin | FY2022 | FY2023 | FY2024 | 9M 2025 | Trend |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|-------|
| Gross | 41.0% | 42.0% | 43.6% | ~44% | Expanding (labor normalization) |
| Operating | 7.4% | 8.0% | 10.6% | ~11.5% | Expanding (record FY2025) |
| Net | 5.1% | 5.0% | 7.2% | ~8% | Expanding |
| FCF/Revenue | 1.9% | 3.6% | 7.1% | ~7% | Recovery from COVID distortion |

**Assessment:** FY2025 will be RECORD year. But the question is whether this is peak earnings before Medicaid headwinds hit in 2027-2032.

---

## 2. WHY IS IT CHEAP?

### 2.1 Market Narrative

P/E 10.1x on record earnings. Market discounts for:
1. **Medicaid policy uncertainty** — Now crystallized into LAW (OBBBA). Market was right.
2. **ROIC near WACC** — 10% ROIC vs 8.3% WACC = 1.2pp spread. Not a compounder.
3. **DOJ/OIG oversight** — 5-year compliance burden on 44% of revenue.
4. **Family control** — Miller dual-class structure reduces governance quality.
5. **Behavioral health volume deceleration** — Q1-Q3 2025 NOT showing the 7-9% CAGR expected.

### 2.2 Contra-Thesis (Updated — Weakened)

| Market Believes | My v2.0 Contra | v3.0 Reassessment |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Medicaid risk real | ACA deeply embedded | **MARKET WAS RIGHT.** OBBBA signed Jul 2025. $1T cuts. |
| Labor costs structural | Peaked 2022-23 | Partially right — stabilizing but nurse wages structurally higher |
| Behavioral overbuilt | Secular growth 7-9% | **VOLUME DATA CONTRADICTS.** Q1 declined, Q2-Q3 barely positive |
| ROIC near WACC | Improving trajectory | **STALLED at ~10%.** No evidence of widening |

**Honest Assessment:** 3 of 4 contra-theses have weakened. The market's discount was more justified than v2.0 acknowledged.

### 2.3 Value Trap Checklist (Updated)

| Factor | Status | Comment |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Industry in secular decline | **NO** | Healthcare growing, but Medicaid-dependent segments at risk |
| Technological disruption | **NO** | Hospitals resistant to disruption |
| Management destroying value | **NO** | Buybacks $1.5B, settlement is operational not strategic |
| Balance sheet deteriorating | **NO** | D/E 0.70, stable |
| Insider selling | **NO** | Miller family aligned |
| ROIC < WACC sustained | **PARTIAL** | At ~10% vs 8.3%, only 1.2pp. One bad quarter erases spread |
| Goodwill >50% equity | **YES** | $3.93B / $6.76B = 58%. Behavioral health acquisitions at risk |
| Regulatory headwind | **YES** | DOJ/OIG + OBBBA Medicaid cuts = dual regulatory pressure |

**Value Trap Score: 2.5 factors (was 1-1.5). Risk INCREASING.**

---

## 3. MEDICAID CUTS: THE DEFINING FORWARD RISK (NEW)

### 3.1 One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)

**Signed into law:** July 4, 2025
**Scope:** $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts over 10 years (largest ever)
**Coverage loss:** 11.8M people lose Medicaid coverage (CBO estimate)
**Work requirements:** Mandatory for non-disabled adults 19-64

### 3.2 UHS-Specific Impact

UHS receives approximately $1.2B/year in supplemental Medicaid payments (DSH payments, upper payment limits, directed payments). These are the MOST vulnerable to cuts.

**Estimated Impact Timeline:**
| Year | Estimated Revenue Loss | Cumulative | Mechanism |
|------|----------------------|------------|-----------|
| 2026 | Minimal (<$50M) | $50M | Phase-in, enrollment verification |
| 2027 | $100-150M | $200M | Work requirements implemented |
| 2028 | $150-200M | $400M | DSH reductions begin |
| 2029-2032 | $200-250M/yr | $800M+ | Full impact + secondary effects |
| Steady-state 2032 | $360-400M/yr | N/A | 25-30% of supplemental Medicaid |

### 3.3 Disproportionate Impact on Behavioral Health

**Behavioral health = largest Medicaid-funded service category in the US.**
- ~60% of Medicaid beneficiaries in behavioral health are in UHS's target demographic
- Work requirements will disproportionately affect psychiatric/substance abuse patients
- Many behavioral health patients cannot meet work requirements due to their conditions
- This creates a paradox: patients too ill to work lose coverage for treatment

**UHS Behavioral Health Exposure:**
| Metric | Value | Implication |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Behavioral revenue | ~$7B (44% of total) | Material segment |
| Medicaid % of behavioral | ~30-35% | Higher than acute care |
| Behavioral revenue at risk | $360-400M by 2032 | ~5-6% of behavioral revenue |
| Uncompensated care increase | $50-100M/yr | Patients who lose coverage still need treatment |

### 3.4 Management Response (Unknown)

Management has NOT quantified OBBBA impact in public guidance. Q4 2025 earnings (Feb 25) will be the first opportunity for commentary. This is a CRITICAL information gap.

---

## 4. DOJ SETTLEMENT AND OIG OVERSIGHT (UPDATED)

### 4.1 Settlement Details

- **Amount:** $122M (paid 2025)
- **Allegation:** False Claims Act — medically unnecessary behavioral health admissions
- **Agreement:** 5-year Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with OIG
- **Monitor:** Independent compliance monitor reviewing behavioral health operations
- **Period:** 2025-2030

### 4.2 Operational Impact

The CIA constrains behavioral health operations in ways that are NOT captured in headline numbers:

1. **Billing scrutiny** — Every admission subject to higher documentation standards
2. **Length of stay pressure** — OIG monitor may flag extended stays
3. **Revenue per patient day** — Compliance overhead reduces effective margin
4. **Growth constraint** — New facilities/expansions subject to enhanced review
5. **Compliance costs** — Estimated $15-25M/yr for monitor, systems, staff

### 4.3 Interaction with Medicaid Cuts

The CIA + Medicaid cuts create a dual headwind:
- Medicaid cuts reduce the patient pool
- CIA constrains how aggressively UHS can bill remaining patients
- Together: lower volume AND lower revenue per unit = margin compression risk

---

## 5. Q3 2025 RESULTS AND FY2025 OUTLOOK

### 5.1 Q3 2025 Results (Strong)

| Metric | Q3 2025 | Q3 2024 | YoY Change |
|--------|---------|---------|------------|
| Revenue | $4.5B | $3.97B | +13.4% |
| EPS (diluted) | $5.69 | $3.71 | +53.4% |
| Net Revenue Acute | $2.53B | $2.24B | +13.3% |
| Net Revenue Behavioral | $1.98B | $1.73B | +14.5% |
| Operating Margin | ~12% | ~9.5% | +250bp |

### 5.2 FY2025 Guidance (Raised)

| Metric | Previous Guide | Raised Guide | My Estimate |
|--------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| EPS | $20.00-21.50 | $21.50-22.10 | $21.80 |
| Revenue | ~$15.5B | ~$15.8B | $15.7B |

### 5.3 Behavioral Health Volume Concern

Despite strong revenue, behavioral health VOLUMES are NOT accelerating:
| Quarter | Behavioral Volume Growth | Revenue Growth | Implication |
|---------|------------------------|----------------|-------------|
| Q1 2025 | **Decline** | Positive (pricing) | RED FLAG |
| Q2 2025 | +0.4% | +8.5% | Pricing driving revenue, not volume |
| Q3 2025 | +0.5% | +14.5% | Same pattern |

**This means:** Revenue growth is PRICING-driven (rate increases), not volume-driven. Pricing growth is less sustainable and more vulnerable to payer pushback, especially under OIG scrutiny.

---

## 6. VALUATION (v3.0 — Multi-Method)

### 6.1 Quality Score

**QS Tool:** 51/100 (Tier C)
| Component | Score | Max | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-----|-------|
| Financial Quality | 18 | 40 | ROIC 10% barely > WACC 8.3%. FCF margin 7% (volatile) |
| Growth Quality | 13 | 25 | Revenue +13% (peak cycle), EPS +53% (unsustainable rate) |
| Moat Evidence | 10 | 25 | Narrow moat — scale + behavioral leadership, but no pricing power |
| Capital Allocation | 10 | 10 | Buybacks excellent, insider ownership (Miller family) |

**QS Adjusted:** 51/100 (no adjustment)
- No upward adjustment warranted: ROIC barely > WACC, Medicaid headwind is structural, DOJ/OIG is real constraint
- No downward adjustment warranted: Tool captures the risks fairly
- **Tier C confirmed** — Special Situation, not Quality Value

### 6.2 WACC (Unchanged)

```
Ke = 4.25% + 1.269 × 5.0% = 10.59%
Kd (after-tax) = 3.58% × (1-0.25) = 2.69%
WACC = (71.5% × 10.59%) + (28.5% × 2.69%) = 8.34%
```

### 6.3 Method 1: EV/EBITDA (50% weight)

**Why 50% weight:** Most appropriate for hospital operators. EBITDA normalizes capex cycles and depreciation differences.

FY2025E EBITDA: ~$2.55B (based on 9M run rate)
Net Debt: ~$4.7B

| Scenario | Multiple | EV | Equity Value | FV/Share | Prob |
|----------|----------|-----|-------------|----------|------|
| Bear | 6.0x | $15.3B | $10.6B | $190 | 35% |
| Base | 7.0x | $17.9B | $13.2B | $237 | 40% |
| Bull | 8.0x | $20.4B | $15.7B | $282 | 25% |

**Multiple Justification (v3.0):**
- Sector median: 7.5x
- Adjustments: -0.5x (ROIC near WACC), -0.5x (Medicaid structural risk), +0.5x (balance sheet strength)
- **Net justified base multiple: 7.0x** (was 7.5x in v2.0 — reduced for Medicaid law)

**Weighted EV/EBITDA FV:** ($190 × 0.35) + ($237 × 0.40) + ($282 × 0.25) = $66.50 + $94.80 + $70.50 = **$231.80** → rounds to ~$232 before further weighting

But using BASE case: **$206** (bear-adjusted from $237 → I use weighted average = **$206** at 50% weight per scenario weights)

Correction — let me be precise:
Probability-weighted EV/EBITDA = (0.35 × $190) + (0.40 × $237) + (0.25 × $282) = $66.50 + $94.80 + $70.50 = **$231.80**

### 6.4 Method 2: P/E (50% weight)

FY2025E EPS: $21.80 (midpoint of $21.50-22.10 guidance)
Forward FY2026E EPS: ~$22.50-23.00 (consensus, pre-Medicaid impact)

| Scenario | P/E Multiple | FV/Share | Prob |
|----------|-------------|----------|------|
| Bear | 8.5x FY26E | $191 | 35% |
| Base | 10.0x FY26E | $225 | 40% |
| Bull | 12.0x FY26E | $270 | 25% |

**Multiple Justification:**
- Current P/E: 10.1x (TTM on record earnings)
- Hospital operator median: 11-13x
- UHS discount: ROIC near WACC, Medicaid risk, DOJ oversight = 10x fair (was higher pre-OBBBA)

**Probability-weighted P/E FV:** (0.35 × $191) + (0.40 × $225) + (0.25 × $270) = $66.85 + $90.00 + $67.50 = **$224.35**

### 6.5 DCF (EXCLUDED — 0% weight)

**Reason for exclusion:** FCF coefficient of variation = 2.3 (extremely volatile). FCF ranged from near-zero (2021) to $1.1B (2024). With Medicaid cuts adding another source of cash flow uncertainty, DCF produces garbage-in-garbage-out results. EV/EBITDA + P/E are more reliable for hospital operators.

### 6.6 Blended Fair Value

| Method | Weight | Probability-Weighted FV |
|--------|--------|------------------------|
| EV/EBITDA | 50% | $231.80 |
| P/E | 50% | $224.35 |
| **Blended** | **100%** | **$228.08** |

**Scenario-weighted Expected Value:**
| Scenario | Prob | EV/EBITDA FV | P/E FV | Blended |
|----------|------|-------------|--------|---------|
| Bear | 35% | $190 | $191 | $190.50 |
| Base | 40% | $237 | $225 | $231.00 |
| Bull | 25% | $282 | $270 | $276.00 |

**EV = (0.35 × $190.50) + (0.40 × $231.00) + (0.25 × $276.00) = $66.68 + $92.40 + $69.00 = $228.08**

**However**, this does NOT fully discount the Medicaid tail risk. Applying a 7% Medicaid haircut to reflect the $360-400M revenue loss materializing over 2027-2032:

**Risk-Adjusted FV = $228 × 0.935 = ~$213**

### 6.7 Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Fair Value (Risk-Adjusted)** | **$213** |
| Current Price | $212.94 |
| **Margin of Safety** | **~0% (NONE)** |
| Bear Case FV | $190 |
| Base Case FV | $231 |
| Bull Case FV | $276 |

**At $212.94, UHS is trading at approximately fair value. There is NO margin of safety.**

## 7. MOAT ASSESSMENT (Narrow — Unchanged but Pressured)

**Rating: NARROW MOAT (under pressure)**

| Factor | Score | Evidence | Trend |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|
| Scale advantages | 6/10 | 3rd largest operator, procurement leverage | Stable |
| Switching costs | 5/10 | Insurance networks, but patients can switch | Stable |
| Regulatory barriers | 6/10 | Certificate-of-need laws protect incumbents | Stable |
| Behavioral health leadership | 7/10 | 331 facilities, largest private operator | **Weakening** (OIG scrutiny) |
| ROIC vs WACC | 4/10 | 1.2pp spread, minimal value creation | Stalled |
| Pricing power | 3/10 | Reimbursement rates set by payers, not UHS | **Weakening** (Medicaid cuts) |

**Moat Assessment:** Narrow moat exists from scale and behavioral health market position. But moat is NOT widening — Medicaid cuts and DOJ oversight create structural pressure on the exact segment (behavioral health) that differentiates UHS from generic hospital operators.

---

## 8. RISK ASSESSMENT (Updated)

### Probability × Impact Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | P×I Score | Category |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|----------|
| **1. Medicaid cuts (OBBBA)** | 95% (LAW) | HIGH | **CRITICAL** | Revenue, structural |
| **2. DOJ/OIG billing scrutiny** | 100% (active) | MEDIUM-HIGH | **HIGH** | Operations, margin |
| **3. Behavioral volume deceleration** | 60% | MEDIUM | **MEDIUM-HIGH** | Growth thesis |
| 4. Labor cost re-acceleration | 35% | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Margin |
| 5. ROIC < WACC reversion | 40% | HIGH | HIGH | Thesis invalidation |
| 6. Goodwill impairment | 25% | MEDIUM | LOW-MEDIUM | Balance sheet |
| 7. State Medicaid rate cuts | 50% | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Revenue |

### Kill Conditions

| # | Condition | Status | Monitoring |
|---|-----------|--------|------------|
| KC#1 | ROIC < WACC for 2 consecutive quarters | WATCH (1.2pp buffer only) | Quarterly earnings |
| KC#2 | Dividend cut or suspension | OK | Quarterly |
| KC#3 | New DOJ/OIG investigation (separate from current CIA) | OK | News monitoring |
| KC#4 | Behavioral health volume decline >5% YoY | WATCH (Q1 2025 declined) | Quarterly |
| KC#5 | FY2026 EPS guidance <$20.00 (Medicaid-driven miss) | CHECK Feb 25 | Earnings |
| KC#6 | Goodwill impairment charge >$500M | OK | Annual |
| KC#7 | Combined ratio (operating costs/revenue) >97% | OK (currently ~88%) | Quarterly |

**Model Disruption Kill Conditions (added 2026-02-11):**

| KC#8 | **Telehealth/AI therapy disrupts behavioral health volumes >10%** | MONITOR | Quarterly |

If digital mental health platforms (Talkiatry, Cerebral, BetterHelp) combined with AI-assisted therapy achieve clinical equivalence to inpatient/PHP behavioral health AND payers (including Medicaid) begin reimbursing virtual behavioral at scale, UHS's behavioral health facilities (60% of EBITDA) face structural volume decline. The COVID-era telehealth boom faded, but AI-enhanced therapy is a different proposition. Monitor: payer telehealth reimbursement policies, UHS behavioral admission trends vs industry, digital therapy clinical trials.

| KC#9 | **Single-payer/public option legislation passes with hospital rate setting** | MONITOR | Legislative |

If federal legislation establishes rate-setting authority (Medicare rates for all) covering UHS's commercial payer mix (~40% of revenue at higher rates), operating margins compress permanently. The OBBBA Medicaid cuts are already law — the political risk is that a future administration responds by expanding public coverage WITH rate controls rather than private market solutions. This would eliminate the commercial payer premium that makes UHS profitable. Monitor: CBO scoring of Medicare-for-All variants, state-level public option programs (WA, CO).

## 9. PRE-EARNINGS FRAMEWORK (Feb 25, 2026)

### What to Watch

1. **FY2026 Guidance** — MOST IMPORTANT. Does management quantify Medicaid impact?
   - Guide >$22.00 EPS → Bullish (Medicaid impact delayed/mitigated)
   - Guide $20.00-22.00 EPS → Neutral (acknowledges headwind, manageable)
   - Guide <$20.00 EPS → **SELL signal** (KC#5 triggered)

2. **Behavioral Health Volumes** — Are Q4 volumes positive?
   - Volume growth >2% → Encouraging (contra Q1-Q3 softness)
   - Volume flat to +1% → Confirming softness pattern
   - Volume decline → **SELL signal** (KC#4 approaching)

3. **Medicaid Commentary** — How does management frame OBBBA?
   - Quantified impact + mitigation plan → Positive (uncertainty reduction)
   - Vague/dismissive → Negative (management not prepared)

4. **DOJ/OIG Update** — Any operational changes from CIA?
   - Compliance costs quantified → Removes uncertainty
   - Additional findings by monitor → Negative surprise risk

### Decision Tree (Post-Earnings)

```
Q4 Results:
├── EPS beats + FY2026 guide >$22 + behavioral volumes positive
│   └── UPGRADE to HOLD MEDIUM. Add at <$200.
├── EPS inline + FY2026 guide $20-22 + Medicaid quantified
│   └── MAINTAIN HOLD LOW. Reassess at 6 months.
├── EPS misses OR FY2026 guide <$20
│   └── SELL (KC#5 or thesis invalidation)
├── Behavioral volumes decline Q4
│   └── SELL (KC#4, structural not cyclical)
└── Labor cost warning (margins compressing)
    └── TRIM 50%, probation
```

---

## 10. MACRO CONTEXT

**Healthcare Sector:** Neutral-to-negative for Medicaid-dependent operators.
- OBBBA signed July 2025 creates structural headwind for hospital operators with high Medicaid exposure
- Commercial insurance remains healthy (employer-sponsored + ACA marketplace)
- Medicare stable (aging population tailwind)
- Rate environment: 10Y at ~4.25%, D/E 0.70 manageable

**UHS-Specific Macro Risk:**
- Medicaid is 25% of payer mix
- Behavioral health has HIGHER Medicaid dependency than acute care
- UHS is MORE exposed to OBBBA than average hospital operator

---

## 11. DECISION

### Principles Applied (Framework v4.0)

**Principio 5 (QS como Input):** QS 51 Tier C. The tool correctly identifies UHS as a Special Situation, not a Quality Value business. ROIC barely exceeds WACC. No upward adjustment warranted.

**Principio 6 (Vender Requiere Argumento):** The argument for holding is: Q3 results are strong, FY2025 is record year, earnings Feb 25 provide information optionality. The argument against holding: FV = price (no MoS), Medicaid structural risk, DOJ constraint. The earnings event in 15 days is the deciding factor.

**Principio 9 (Quality Gravitation):** UHS is Tier C with 1.2pp ROIC-WACC spread. This capital ($403 invested) would generate better returns in a Tier A compounder. However, selling 15 days before earnings when Q3 was +53.4% EPS risks selling at worst timing. Patience through earnings is defensible.

### Precedent Check

From `decisions_log.yaml`:
- SELL decisions (A2A.MI, VNA.DE) triggered by QS <45, FV materially below price, and no upcoming catalyst
- UHS differs: QS 51 (higher), FV ≈ price (not below), and earnings catalyst in 15 days
- HOLD-through-earnings precedent (EDEN.PA, MONY.L, DTE.DE) is appropriate

### RECOMMENDATION

**STATUS: HOLD LOW conviction — ON PROBATION through Feb 25 earnings**

**Rationale:**
1. FV $213 ≈ price $212.94 — NO margin of safety
2. QS 51 Tier C — NOT quality, NOT compounder
3. ROIC 10% vs WACC 8.3% = 1.2pp spread — minimal value creation
4. Medicaid cuts are LAW — structural forward risk
5. But: Q3 beat was exceptional, earnings in 15 days, selling NOW risks missing positive Q4
6. Binary event: Feb 25 earnings will determine HOLD/SELL

**Exit Plan:**
- **SELL** if FY2026 EPS guidance <$20.00 (KC#5)
- **SELL** if Q4 behavioral volumes decline (KC#4)
- **SELL** if ROIC < WACC (KC#1)
- **TRIM at $240** (approach FV, take profit)
- **HOLD** if guide >$22.00 + volumes positive → upgrade to MEDIUM conviction
- **ADD only at $180** (15% MoS on bear case)
- **Post-earnings SELL/HOLD decision is MANDATORY** — no indefinite probation

### Position Context

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Invested | $402.84 (2 shares) |
| Avg Cost | $201.42 |
| Current | $212.94 |
| P&L | +$23.04 (+5.7%) |
| Portfolio Weight | ~3.7% |
| Maximum Loss (to $190 bear) | -$22.88 (-5.7%), portfolio -0.2% |

The position is small (2 shares, ~3.7%). Even in the bear case ($190), portfolio impact is -0.2%. This makes HOLD-through-earnings defensible on risk management grounds.
